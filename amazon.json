Will use until I find something non-chemical that 's less expensive .”\n|| : {rating: 5} “Great way to spice things up in the bedroom . Tasteless and not sticky . Washes off with water . Does not stain fabrics . Safe with Silicone .”\n|| : {rating: 4} “This product is both nicely packaged and nicely priced . The lubricating quality of the Aloecadabra is very good although each application 's effectiveness is somewhat shorter than the silicone type lubricants .

Very useful for toys or regular play”\n|| : {rating: 5} “excellent . Best natural ever used and it 's organic , which makes it ok for oral sex also . The coconut is great for that ...”\n|| : {rating: 4} “Bought this to see how we like it . It is a good lube but doesnt last as long as some other lubes . If you like the all natural this is a great lube .”\n|| : {rating: 5} “It 's organic and natural which is a super plus . Also , it 's really reasonably priced and works great ( especially if you add a tiny bit of water to it when applying ) .”",

Not really worth buying. my wife and girls probably will not buy more”\n|| : {rating: 1} “These are way too big for waxing your upper lip unless you cut hem down . And it 's not worth all that effort to do .”\n|| : {rating: 5} “So many strips in such a low price . It took about 30 days to reach my home but when I used them I felt so good about it . Awesome product .”\n|| : {rating: 5} “I recently purchased this to use on my clients , and it works so well . As long as the wax is applied properly this strip will pull every hair in sight .
