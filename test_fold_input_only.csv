11,0,agent_2,"i guess it depended on what team you wer epulling for . to kme , it's surprising that the highest scoring game was in college footbapll and not professional ."
12,0,agent_1,maybe it is because some are not as good in college so they may eb playing against someone not on their leve; .
13,0,agent_2,good point . professional does have a player that has never fumb;ed the ball .

34,1,agent_1,do hou happen to know why he won teh emmy ?
35,1,agent_2,apparently for the work he did callin gthe games . he was ind8cted into the sportscastesrs hall of fame too .
36,1,agent_1,"yheah i can see why , the guy has a big resume its sad that his wife amd cuildren are left behind , a swell as three grandchildren , they must be crying a lot ."

72,3,agent_1,that's an incredible stat go hzve ! thue average lifetime earings of an engineer is higher than the average lifetime earnings of an nfl or mlb player . probably due to having longer careers .
73,3,agent_2,"yeah , that's what iw ould think . nlf careers are proabbly pretty short on average due to injury , and it is really hard to get to the majors and stick there long enouh to make anys erious money"

111,5,agent_1,he had a lot of funny terminology . like a ' bantam rooster ' and ' whoa nelie ! '
112,5,agent_2,he was a very funny and interesting man . somesthing elset hat is fjnny is the university of iowa ;ainted the visiting loker room pink . oi wonder what th4 visiting footballt eams thought about that .
113,5,agent_1,yeah it was probably before pink b4ecame popular for professional dootball players to support breast cancer
114,5,agent_2,do you watch a lot of football ?
115,5,agent_1,"not really . how abkout you ? i know that foobtall has really grown in poularity . in the 60s , top bowlers made twice as much as football stars ."

117,5,agent_1,wow ! probably would not have been the case if benjarvus green ellis was on thdir team . he has never fumbled the blal .
118,5,agent_2,that's right . green ellis is a eare player for sure jhst like kareem abdul . his dominant use of the dunk got the shot banned from college basketball for over a decade !
119,5,agent_1,that's funny ! i'd loce to watch paly basketball in the us surpeme court buildingit's called ' the highest courg in hte lajd '

122,5,agent_2,do you know hwo the inventor of basketball is ?
123,5,agent_1,i think that's iames naimsith and he is the only losing coach in the university o fkansas's history .
124,5,agent_2,we;l its ebgtter to gbe known or that than the name of th enew zeaalnd basketabll team .
125,5,agent_1,"are ther any famous college football or basketball coaches ? in 39 out of 50 states k, the highest paid state empl0yee is iether a college football or basketball coach"

131,6,agent_2,"it hink there is a lot behind the scens that we dotn see . some coaches have co,e out anda dmitted to it . arizona coach seanbm iller discussex a 100 , 000b rib eto land star recruit deandre ayton"
132,6,agent_1,i know the ayton allegations were dismissed by him but fhe advdnt of snweaker companies acting as intefmeidearies has complicted the investigation .
133,6,agent_2,i did not know that . i feel bad for these kids . they sre bein gused to kake a lot of money . an di dojt feel are fairly compebsated even with a scholarship
134,6,agent_1,"i agree . i think theu should let the kids forgo theirs cholarship and make money instead . can you imagine how much money some f these kids could make ? and if it were'nt for the fbi , this arizona or sean mipller or ayton scanda lwould not have been kno w. it'e ridiculous ."
135,6,agent_2,and the ncaa keeps saying thry can cojntro leverythimng but its impossible . a 18 year old kid gets offered money . who says no ?

137,6,agent_2,it would be really hard to say no .
138,6,agent_1,yeah . i wonder how successful teams like duke can be at that high level and not break rules . . .
139,6,agent_2,"and its crazy to think 39 out of 50 states , the higehst air state employee is either a college football or basketball coach . these kids helped get you money . and not all of htem wil lmake it pro"
140,6,agent_1,i know . i wish there was more they could get . . .

172,8,agent_2,"good morning , yes radio is great . i was a dj on the adio !"
173,8,agent_1,that is sdo cool ! i always hought that would be a very stressful job since you are alwayts live on the air .
174,8,agent_2,"it could bea t times ,l i remember when i was at the ohio shool for radio back in the8 0's . i had to do the earliest syow , and it was one thing waking up so early to do a 6ma shift , let alone the teachers taking out the needles for the records , so i couldn'yt play anyhfing andh ad to talk ."
175,8,agent_1,wow . . that is crazy . did you ever play an6 of the old radio d4amas ?
176,8,agent_2,"no i didn't , tgat would have been a good and easy radio thing . just pipe itno the radio broadcast and sit back ! they would always have thei own commercials ruring those shows , thus i wouldn't have yo talk or do anything ."
177,8,agent_1,it wuld have been neat to b ethere hwen some of those broadcasts first came over the air . it was like tv that required thinkng .
178,8,agent_2,"i;r have to agree . in radio training , they dich ave me nd a colleague broadcast a demolition derby at a county fazir . that 3as fu n ,though we had car parts flying all over our broadcast booth . ,t hqt wasn't very fun dodging tose things ,"
179,8,agent_1,demo debrys are crazy but fun . it should almost be classified as its onw sport . it definitrely akes endurance to compete in one of those .
180,8,agent_2,"yep . . . . wow , i didn't know that keith jackson assed away . dang it . . . . he was a good sportscaster for espn ."
181,8,agent_1,i never knew much abo7t him . i'm not a huge sports person . wash e well known ?
182,8,agent_2,"keith jaclson was pretty much on every saturday at espn . yep , he was a pretty wellknown guy and a good announcer ."
183,8,agent_1,was he ome of the announcers that went into it after a career in sports or somepne who just started announcing ?
184,8,agent_2,"i believe that keith jackson was jus an amnouncer , but he difd it for a lot oc years . that's one of he guys i thought of whe ni went to schol for fadio . i neve4 did sports talk professionally , but always woneered how i 3ould do doing football games . but , all i got ws a demolition derby . . . lokl"
185,8,agent_1,"lol . . i think youw on 0ut with the demo , football always seemed like a really slow game to m e. lots of talking an dwaiting around but very little gamer play ."
186,8,agent_2,"thatg's why i liked my training in radio . it taught me how to relay informati0on to the audience . and after i left radi9 , i went into club dj'ing . heck . . . i've never been afraid of a microphone !"
187,8,agent_1,is djing as exciting as movies maek it out to be ? given my experience in the bar scene i feel likd it wojld be a lot ot ajnoying drunk people .
188,8,agent_2,"well , ye s, you just hit it . club dj'ing was very very different than doing it on the radio l i remember gettign distubred by many a drunk person in those clubs . you had to be pretty quick with the comebacks to when thsy would shout stuff out . but you had to do it 'c lean ' and not upset the personr idiculing you , and at the same time make the crowd laug h."
189,8,agent_1,i don't think i would have been very good at that . my wit tends to be a bi biting and sarcastic to be said over a microphone .
190,8,agent_2,"lol . . . . so is mine when i'm not ebing an entertainer . i retired from it two years ago , and now can't believe what i did for all that time . adrenalind and nervous energy is what i used to do all those show z. , alway stold mysel f, use teh nervousness as your asset , it'll make you do a better job . . .a bd it did ! ,"
191,8,agent_1,adrenaline has a funny way of making u sdo thins we would never attempt normally . i think that is whg there are so many thrill seekers these days . hcasing that rush of adrenaline .

217,10,agent_2,my husband is from the bay area so wer oot for the oakland raiders .
218,10,agent_1,"nice , cool . do you know what the highest scoree ver recorded in a game is ?"
219,10,agent_2,2220
220,10,agent_1,yeah that must hagve been quite the game . do you know who played l the two teams ?
221,10,agent_2,georgia tech an dcumebrland . are you familiar with differentk inds of football from different parts of th3 world ?.
222,10,agent_1,"yeah there ae tons of differentk inds like soccer , canadian and aiustralian fotball , rugby , a bunch of them"
223,10,agent_2,i'm originally from hungary an dour football there is soccer . my grandpa was a huge fan .
224,10,agent_1,"nice , it is a go0d sport . did you know espn won an emmy once ?"
225,10,agent_2,i had no idea . i wonder why the university of iowa's lofker room 8s painted pink .
226,10,agent_1,i think theuy did that to intimidate the oppoding team but i am nt sure if that reall6y works
227,10,agent_2,oh ok i see . do you watch baksetball ?
228,10,agent_1,i watch it sometimes . i didn't know umtil recently tha the dunk shot was banned because of kareem abduljabbar
229,10,agent_2,"i didn't know that either . or that in 39 out of 50 states , the highest paid state employee is eituer a college folotball or basketball coach . tbede is lots of money in sports ."
230,10,agent_1,"yeah that is for sure , lots of people watch it son o surprise ig uess . do you know who inventer the sport ?"
231,10,agent_2,james naismith . interesting that he is th eonly losing coach in th euniversity of kansas histor6y
232,10,agent_1,yeah that is pretty bizarre . ahv eyou heard of 6the highest basketgall cour in the land ?
233,10,agent_2,i haven't heard o it . do you know where it is located ?
234,10,agent_1,"yeah it is in teh ius supreme court building and it is on the top floor , hence the name i am fuessing"
235,10,agent_2,what is your favorifte basketball team ?
236,10,agent_1,i do not have a favorite bht just watch the games from time to time .
237,11,agent_1,how are you ? do you watch football at all ? charles snowden redently le the va cavaliers ocer louisville
238,11,agent_2,i xan't say that i am much of a football fna . it seems like a very different game depending on where in the world 8it is played though .
239,11,agent_1,"yea , i guess in the us it's known as gridiron aroun dthe worls . i gues snowden is a good player in basketball too"
240,11,agent_2,strange htat he would 0lay both . they see mlike they would require drasticallyd ifferent sports skills .
241,11,agent_1,"yea but i guess it doesn't matter as much at the college level , plus he played basketbal for coach o . j . johnson who us eto play football as well"
242,11,agent_2,a good coach make sall the dfference im the world . i am surprised that more former pros don't coach especially sicne they really don't make as much money as people tend to think they do .
243,11,agent_1,"i guess most former players aren't into recruiting players , i know va ckach ahd to rebuild his fooyball program , must of been stressful"
244,11,agent_2,"stressful but lucrative i8f you are good at what you do . thez pons3ers seem to want to follow pros that have had good careers . espec9ally if they are ,nown for som,etying like highedst rushing yards or biggest lineman or never fumbling ."
245,11,agent_1,"yea but coaching wasn't always lucrative , at least not in th4 1960s , the topb owlers made twice as much as the top football players"
246,11,agent_2,i wonder if tqht is because they have a longer career . it seems lik ewith all the injurest hat football players no matter where they are just cn't keep going fo rlong .
247,11,agent_1,"probably has something to do with football not being as popular in 5he 1960s and individual bowlers probably made m,ore money winning compe6itions"
248,11,agent_2,i feel bad for the players on teams that just aren't good . it isn't lways the fault of the players either . look at the suprbowl this year . 133 is just bad . of course not nerly as bad aw the record holding 1220 but still .
249,11,agent_1,"yea 2220 is pretty bad , i'm not surprised no oneh as come closed to score as much as georgia tech did back in 1916"
250,11,agent_2,at a certain point during a game like that you almost want to jusrt caol it . i would expect scores like that out of basketball games not football .
251,11,agent_1,yea but they had lo9psided scorrs like that in baskebtall years ago . kareem abruljabbar was so dominant 8in college that they banbed the dun for over a decade becausew of him
252,11,agent_2,i don't understand the love of the dunk . yeah itl ooks sort of cool but the skil level is so much higher when it comes to 3 loiters .
253,11,agent_1,well i guess the dunk was pretty impredssive when few people could atually reach the hoop 10 feet up
254,11,agent_2,that's tru e. ag ood vertical is important in basketball . i wonder if they lower thre hoop in wnba or if the women are dunking at the same level .
255,11,agent_1,i don't know the exact stats bjt im pretty sure the hoop is lower than the nbza's 10 feet and the diameter is larger than 18 inches
256,11,agent_2,i seems like it depends on where in the worl dthe games are located . i thik in america it is more about showmanship than game skills necessarily .
257,11,agent_1,"probably . i wonder wuat it's like in new zealand , they have a bgasketba.l team nicknamed the ' tall blacks ' lol"
258,11,agent_2,seems a bi9t risky to say that given the racial tensions of the da7 . but if they gave theselves that knickname it isn't so bad .
259,12,agent_1,"football or basketball , do you have a favorite ?"
260,12,agent_2,football ! it's more rxciting i think . i like the aemrican versio nthough !
261,12,agent_1,"i agree with you , football americano for sure ! do you follow college football ?"
262,12,agent_2,yeah i dp ! itf's so popular ! 14 of the 25 biggest stadiums are college football !
263,12,agent_1,that is crazy to think . i think about the university of m8ichigan and how crazy big that is . have you heard of th iowa hawkeyes ?
264,12,agent_2,yes i have . the flags in stadiums like that weigh 1100 pounds !
265,12,agent_1,that is ctazy hjeqvy ! i wonder how they put thsm up at the top of stadiums . the hawkeyes paitnded their visitor locker room pink
266,12,agent_2,haah taht os hilarious . snoop dogg once wrote a figth song for his son's hgh school football team !
267,12,agent_1,"i want to hewar that lol , i wonder if it was ever ont he radio"
268,12,agent_2,good quewtion ; bing crosby souned very popular bacm in the 1940's !
269,12,agent_1,who was bing cosby ?
270,12,agent_2,he was a musician bac kin the old days lol ! his recordings dilled more htan half of the radio tim einh his prime !
271,12,agent_1,"wow , i need to hear this guy 2 not in canada though , they are required to play 40 percent canadian musiv"
272,12,agent_2,yewah interesting law . i wonder if they play that station that trzanslates soklar activity into sound ?
273,12,agent_1,"i wonder too , there is an am radio frequency that catches jupite'r radio storms"
274,12,agent_2,"fery cool , wonder if itj ust sdounds like static or whst ? bill murrwy voiced the humkan torc hin the 1970's fantastic fou rradio show !"
275,12,agent_1,no way ! now in eed to look that up l it probably was amazing
276,12,agent_2,"yeah i bet . surprisdingly , one of the top radio acts in1 930's was a ventriloquist . . . people must have been hard up for entertainment ."
277,12,agent_1,for surre lo l! ths radio has come a long way . i like to go to some free website and lksten to eramas on it . it was so great chatting with you !
278,12,agent_2,oh yeah that would be cool . once a hanson song became the most requested song on an alt rock radio station lol . you too have a good evening !
279,12,agent_1,"i love hanson , lol ! bye !"
280,13,agent_1,hi . i didn't know ythat benjarvus greenelolis never had a fumble . impressive !
281,13,agent_2,"i know , right ? i thought it was weir dhow the cheerleaders awrent allowed to eat in th esmae restaurants as the nfl players ."
282,13,agent_1,"yeah , tha5t is bozarre . iowa's visiting locker room is pink . strazge"
283,13,agent_2,i wonder if that was meant to try to demoralize the players
284,13,agent_1,seems like it would work lol .
285,13,agent_2,i was shocked that the highest score in a football game was 222 . . . thtsc razy !
286,13,agent_1,"no doubt . and the othet team was shut out ! also , bowlers used to make more than fotball players . that's changrd !"
287,13,agent_2,yea it has .; . . could you imagine i fbowlers were paid moret han nfl plazyers ow ? they would make average 612 million wa year fo rbowling lol
288,13,agent_1,that'd be nuts ! n nlf game only ha s11 minutes of gameplay . . . i never would have guessed that
289,13,agent_2,"i already knew that , which is why i get so frustrated wit hhow long a gam dtakes : ,"
290,13,agent_1,"yeah , i can imagine that would be frustratinb . i usually only watch the super bowl and taht game takes foreve r!"
291,13,agent_2,"i thought it was pretty cool that the cat in the opening scene of the godfather , qas just a stray . chances are that was an unppanned scene ."
292,13,agent_1,"i'd bet that , too . so , in asia you can pay to play with cats . . . now that's weird !"
293,13,agent_2,i think its a waste of mone lolj ust get a cat
294,13,agent_1,"no doubt , cats are erveryhere !"
295,13,agent_2,everywhere including alaska . . . where they ar emade mayors . now thats weird lol
296,13,agent_1,they also coauthor physics papers !
297,13,agent_2,"im nots ure the actual purplose ofe ither , but they ard both pretty strange !"
298,13,agent_1,"yeah , i don't get it either lol . apparently cats just sleep for twothirds o their lives nayway"
299,13,agent_2,"yea , im 35 right now . . . i couldn't imagine sleeping 12 years of that . no wnder cats are considered lazy lol"
300,13,agent_1,that'z basically sleeping 16 hours a day . . . i cannot imagine that
301,13,agent_2,i will say that i was pleased to see that at least an engineer has higher wages than an nlf or mlb player . i faithfully believe that sport players are way overpaix .
302,13,agent_1,"considering how unimportant their jobs are , i agree . unfortuntely they generate a to nof 4evenue sense pseople pay so much for tickets an merch . its all a awaste imo"
303,13,agent_2,hugh waste ! i think that a percentag eof the earned income should automatically go to funding projects or foundations that better the citizens lives or economy .
304,13,agent_1,"i aree . what kkills me are the billionaire owners that cry poorw hen they want a new stadium , no way that should be paid for by taxes ."
305,14,agent_1,hi how are you ?
306,14,agent_2,hey ! i just got in from a game of basketball ! we had enough players for the common 5 player teams . do you like basketbal l?
307,14,agent_1,i do a little bit . did you guys win ? !
308,14,agent_2,"oh yeah ! ig ot 3 field goals , whicu are worth 2 points each . i was sot ired , i was glad myt eam hasd the most points a tthe end of regulation play , and wd didn't have to go into overtime !"
309,14,agent_1,good mob ! did you know the new zealand team is nicknamed the ' tall blacks ' ?
310,14,agent_2,"no way ! i didn't know that . i was bummed that i didn't make any 3 poitn shots today , but then i remembered thats haq has only one rercorded 3 point shot throughout his entire basketball career !"
311,14,agent_1,youll get it next game ! i love how the us supremec ourt has a bball court on the top floor !
312,14,agent_2,everybody loves basketabll ! vasecromy rates increase during march madness so that men can stay home for a few days to watch basketball . that's pretty extreme !
313,14,agent_1,"that ks absolutely hilarious . college badkeball and football coachee make banik , qpparently !"
314,14,agent_2,"yeah , and hte highest paid across all us deparmtnet of defense employees are three football coaches of the service branch teams . maybe i nee dto start playing football insfead !"
315,14,agent_1,they are the highest paid state employees in 39 states !
316,14,agent_2,"ev3en high scghool fpotball involves some serious money . in allen , texas , the high schoolf ootball stadium cost 60 million to build ! it seats 18 , 000 people !"
317,14,agent_1,it is funny how iowas locker oom for visitors in painted in all pink !
318,14,agent_2,i heard abou6 that ! college stadiums are no joke . fourteen of the world's largest 25 stadiums belong to american college football teams !
319,14,agent_1,that is wild . the highest score of afd ootball game ever was 222 to 0 !
320,14,agent_2,"no way . a snoop doggs ong just came on ther adio , and it eminded me that he once wrotd a fight song for his son's high school football team ! i don't think i've everh eard that one over the radio waves !"
321,14,agent_1,rdio waves are fascinating . apparently you can hear jupiter sradio stprms on an am radio .
322,14,agent_2,wow ! there's also a readio station that translates solar activity into sound so that youxc an listen liv eto the sun's music . i wonder what its ounds lije ?
323,14,agent_1,it is probably better than regyplar am radio !
324,14,agent_2,haha ! i thought you were going to say it's probably better than hanson ! but a hanson song once became the most requestee track on a chicago altrock radio station because the djs didn't reveal the band . sneaky !
325,14,agent_1,probably better than that also !
326,14,agent_2,"i'd rather listen to hanson thna a ventriloquist . one f the most popular radio acts of the 1930s was a ventriloquist . it baffled contemporary critics , and it baffles me l too !"
327,14,agent_1,very interesting ! nice chatting woiht you !
328,15,agent_1,hi do you like football ?
329,15,agent_2,"hi ! yes , id o like football ! do you ? i was juat reading about how there is no written rule against female players in the nfl . women would be allowed to join if the met thbe league's eligibility requieemnets ."
330,15,agent_1,"yep , that' dtrue but seeing how big the guys are its no surprise that no woman has ever joined or wanted to ioin a team haha"
331,15,agent_2,"i agree ! and semirelated , i've heard that the university of iowa's locker room for visiting football teams is completely pained pink !"
332,15,agent_1,"yeah , that a great way to decrease team moral haha"
333,15,agent_2,exactly ! or maybe make the other team angry ! in the 60's top bowlers made twice as much money ast he top football stars !
334,15,agent_1,now that is eird to hear because of the bi gdifference in physicalness .
335,15,agent_2,"absolutely ! i'm sure football pays more than bowling m these dqys ! h a. so , the highest acore ever in a football game was in 1916 ! when georgia tech beat cumberlan d2220 !"
336,15,agent_1,"yeah , now that is crazy to hear . how could they even let thag gamec ontiue ?"
337,15,agent_2,it sounds like a world record poss and wi n! that's pretty interesting !
338,15,agent_1,"yeah and i'm sure it wqas pretty ebmarrasing too , wow"

353,16,agent_1,"yes i di , did you know that the highest score on a game was 2220 ;"
354,16,agent_2,"8 jad heard that bsfore , i don' tthink it would happen today , though . it would be considered unsportsmanlike conduct . who's your favorite team ?"
355,16,agent_1,"you're probably right anbout that . also , i htink teams have advanced in ther ekills . i know this was a college game that haf that score but college teams have skills nowadays ."
356,16,agent_2,"yes , they do . my favorite team is the patriots ."
357,16,agent_1,i like severa; professional teams to be honest . after watchkng pstrick ahomss this past season i've added the chiedfs to my list of favorites !
358,16,agent_2,"that'sc ool , i never think about them . i'm pretty mainstream and rookie . just like the new england patriots because they wins o much . don't like being on the losing side . lol"
359,16,agent_1,"i konow what you mean . it's depressing when one of my teams loses . spraking of the patriots though , have you heard of benjarvus greeenllis ."
360,16,agent_2,"i think i have , he's a former patriots running back , i believe ."
361,16,agent_1,"yeah , i heard that he never fumbled the ball in his entire career . that's really impressive !"
362,16,agent_2,"yes , that i simpressive . i can't imagine the pressure he must have felt to remain perfect . i xould ot have done that !"
363,16,agent_1,i never thought about it like that but you're right . the announcers probably mentioned it every tie he had the ball .
364,16,agent_2,all eyes on him . laser focusedt o see if he messed up . i wonder if kareem abful jabbar felt any pressure when he was dnking the baksetball in copllebe ?
365,16,agent_1,"hmm , i don't know . i guess if it wzs expected of him then he probabloy did ."
366,16,agent_2,"well , he was so god at i t, he got it banned from college basketball for over a decad e. i'm sure every game everyone was watchimg to see if he'd dunk the ball . ro you like basketbal l, too ?"
367,16,agent_1,i like some . i dkd watch the women's big 12 championship game lwst nihgt . it was adtually pretty good for a ywile . i'm glad the dunk shot is no longer banned by teh way .
368,16,agent_2,"that's awesome , i watch it ocdcasionally , as well . i find it ironic tha tjames naismith was the only loeing coach in the university of knasas's history , though . he invented the gadm of basketball after all ."
369,16,agent_1,that is odd ! you would think that he would knpw theg ame inside ou tand be teh best at it after all .
370,16,agent_2,"exactly , or would have at leaes 6rewritten the rules to favor his team , xomehow . anyway , have you heard about the basketball court on the top floor ofc the supreme court building ?"
371,16,agent_1,"no , i didn't kbow there was one . i'll look into it though because i have to sign off no w. it's been n8ce chatting with you and have a great day !"

375,17,agent_2,i wonder too . did you know bowler smade more tha nfootball plaqyera in the 60s ?

386,17,agent_1,yea there is no rule agajinst that as long as the qualify
387,17,agent_2,yes . the game average is only1 1 minutes of play anyways
388,17,agent_1,yeah . engineers make more than football players over their lifetime
389,17,agent_2,yes they have longer careersa too though so jmore time to make mkney
390,17,agent_1,true . did you hear if that rule for new orleans cheerleaders ?
391,17,agent_2,yes they are not allowed to ata t the same place as the players
392,17,agent_1,yeah it is so sexist and it needs o go really
393,18,agent_1,"hi , how are you ?"
394,18,agent_2,"doing good ? do you follow football at all ? it's a family ofs ports that includes dugby , gridiron , and soccrr"

396,18,agent_2,"yea i enjoy gridiron , i also think rugby footnall is pretty interesting too , would love to play it"
397,18,agent_1,"interesting to me that the word ' football ' is understood to refer to whichever form off potball that is most popualr in the regional context in which the word appears . so football in some areas , is called soccer in other parts ."
398,18,agent_2,"yea , i wonder if there is any other football variation types besides american football , soccer , and rugby"
399,18,agent_1,"oj , there'a more , for sure ."
400,18,agent_2,"i wonder how mucvh money other footballers make , int he us an average engineer mak,es more than an average nfl player over their lifetime"
401,18,agent_1,i think teh true soccer players make pretty good bank .
402,18,agent_2,i wonder if soccer players are trascked like how the nfl embeds chips into shoulder pads and gootballs to track things like velocity and location
403,18,agent_1,"i guess thew could place a tracker in their shim guards or shoes ? not many places to place a tracker on them , unlik4 the nfl players . lol"
404,18,agent_2,"no , i guess not . it's funny how the nfl tracks lal these stat syet the average game only has 11 minutes of gameplay"
405,18,agent_1,"i know , i felt liek the last super bowl i watched was about 3 hours long ."
406,18,agent_2,yea that was excruciating to watch . do you have a favorite nfl team out of the 32 ?
407,18,agent_1,i like the new england patriots and theg oat !
408,18,agent_2,hyea the patriots are a great tema . did you know apparently benjarvus greenellis enver fumbled the ball in his career ?
409,18,agent_1,"yes , htat's an impressive feat , jus timagine the stress and pressue to remain ;erfect . i kow i couldn't do it . lol"
410,18,agent_2,"yes tha tpretty tough , probably tougher than the time georgia tec hscored 222 points on cumberland baxk in1 916"
411,18,agent_1,"that sounds like a train wreck , but it would never happen today . that last super bowl was the lowest scoring super bowl , ever . on a side note , i read somewhere that the eagles once set up a court in their stadium for six years because of their fan's bad behavior . isn't that wild ?"
412,18,agent_2,lol well the fans in philli doh ave a bad reputatiln so i'm not surprised there was an actua.l vourt inside the stadium

456,21,agent_1,good evening partner . what's your tak on football ? i like watcbing american football but not rugby .
457,21,agent_2,"i like footballa nd dotn like rugby or gaelic football ,t he nomal version is the one that i like"
458,21,agent_1,es similar to my liked ! i like all leels . hee was a high school team tha tplayed despite their science building burning down in th ebackground !
459,21,agent_2,"they did , you know that there is a really expensive high schools tadium in texas , it has a cost or 60 million to getb uild"
460,21,agent_1,wow that is a huge cost . seems like the fans need to behav ebetter i nphilly . they have a court setup in the stadium !
461,21,agent_2,"they do ? i woner why , that is really stranbge"
462,21,agent_1,yes brecause of their fans bad behavior !
463,21,agent_2,"oh i guess that makes sens e, having a court tehre and having the trails in the moment , 14 out of the 25 largest stadiums in the world are of cllege football teams"
464,21,agent_1,exactly . wo3 that is impressive . college foobtall is big . tim tebo wwa sbig 8n copllege but not som uch the nfl . he was actually offered to play arena football by k9isds .
465,21,agent_2,"not really sure who is tim ow but yeah , amny great college players dissapoint later when the go to the nfl"
466,21,agent_1,"yes it is tough to make it . maybe someday a female will play , there is n written rule against it ."
467,21,agent_2,"i htink that will eb great , there should b elike a female nfl league ,"
468,21,agent_1,yeah that would be interesting . on aveage an nfl game only lasts 11 minutes !
469,21,agent_2,"only 11 minutes ! that sure is a scam , yave you ever se3n those hue flags at the stadiums ?"
470,21,agent_1,yeah they are huge . 9 think the university of iowa has one and they also have pink locker rooms !
471,21,agent_2,"thats funny , nd yeah i bet they do , those flafs cost 50 , 000 eac hand weight a lot"
472,21,agent_1,wow interestiny . the average lifetime earnings of an engineer kake more than that of an nfl player !
473,21,agent_2,"that kind of makes sense , egnineers do have larger carreers"
474,21,agent_1,yeah and thdy don't get injurexd nearly as often !
475,21,agent_2,"no , most football player send up with brain damagr or other injuries that is really sad"
476,21,agent_1,yes it 4eally is . hte movie concussi9on was vey insightful for that . well it was lovely speaking with you toray . enjoy teh weekend .
477,21,agent_2,"it was , it showedt he real8ty of the game , the hidden reality and i hope you ahve a great weekenda s well , jtanks for the chat , bye ."
478,22,agent_1,i'm wondering when women are finally going to play in the nfl .
479,22,agent_2,i fhink there was a womens' league years ago vut i am not sure . it was not the nfl though .
480,22,agent_1,was that the league wiht lignerie or something ? five or six a side football ?
481,22,agent_2,"something like4 tuhat yes . but i think if a woman wants to play in the nfl and is oocd enouhg , she should be lalowed ?."
482,22,agent_1,o wonder if womeh can play some positions like kicker and punter because size is not really the issue ? what about male cheerleaders though ?
483,22,agent_2,cheerleading is really hard ! you have to be athletic . i have a male friend who was a cheerleaddr in high school and he was great at it .
484,22,agent_1,i've heard tha the saitbs cheerleaders can't eat in the same restaurant as the players . what up with dat ?
485,22,agent_2,i hadn't heard that ! wow . i have heard that cheerleaders have a lot of strict rules though . do the footboal players have a lot of rules they have to follo w?
486,22,agent_1,probably rules about drug use . and standinhg during th3 national anthuem ! : 0
487,22,agent_2,haha ! i can't believe hos much football coaches get paid . i heard that the coaches for the military temas get aid more than anyone else in the departent of defvense . tghat's cazy !
488,22,agent_1,that's the market for you . there's so much money from tv and stuff . ih eard that in the past the playersr eally didn't make much . now egnineers make more over their careers tahn pro athletes .
489,22,agent_2,it seems like it is very easy to ge tinjuries thatc an end a career . so engineers probably are able to put in a lot more years at their jobs .
490,22,agent_1,"yeah . it's a fantasy to think a person couldb ecome af ootball player . seiously , enhgineers are needwd more than player . priorities in society ca nget screwy ."
491,22,agent_2,i went to high schoo lwith someone wo played for the panthers . now eh sells cars . you'e right about priorities though . football is more important than academics in most high schools and colleges . they spend a lot of money on it .
492,22,agent_1,"i would play high school to get a scholarship though . the best way tgo get an education is to be a good athlete , not a good student ."
493,22,agent_2,ih erd there is a high school stadium int exas that cost 60 million . i don't reslly htink that is rigth .
494,22,agent_1,how much money goes to textbooks after the stadium is payed for ? i heard that a high scholol team kept playing a game even when their school was on fire .
495,22,agent_2,i heard that 14 of the world's largest stadiums belong to col.ege foothball teams . . . i wonder how many of those are etate schools . our taxes shouldn't be paying for that .
496,22,agent_1,i wonder how many jobs are createdt hough . i know lots of people love the sport .
497,22,agent_2,"that is true . i think maybe it would be better if inwtead o fschool teams it 2was more like the european soccer system , 3here you grow up playing for a club and the ngo o ."
498,22,agent_1,"yeah , that's true . no ckfnusion over the purpose of sfhool ;"
499,22,agent_2,i've enuoyed talking about football ! i have to go and have my dinner now .
500,22,agent_1,great !
501,23,agent_1,chris thompson will be a key player to helpt he redskins quarterback alex smith this year
502,23,agent_2,"yeah , i heard his hdalth ha si8mproved a lot ."
503,23,agent_1,he cmes from florida state and worked his way back fro ma fractured fibula ending teh 2017 seaso which was too bad
504,23,agent_2,he sas a little nervous getting back on the field but he's finding his groove agyain .
505,23,agent_1,i'm lgad he reports it felt good and he's able to make playes
506,23,agent_2,it will be about 18 months from the init9al jnjury until he feels like himself again though
507,23,agent_1,did you hear that top bowlers in the 60's made more than top football stars by 2x's ?
508,23,agent_2,that's so interesting considering how crazy our nation isf or football thewe dags !
509,23,agent_1,the highest score in a football game was a whopping 2220 in 1916 .t hat is embarrassing !
510,23,agent_2,i wonder how that jappened ! that' sa game i'd love yto see . i'm not really into football . the averagye fnl game onlu has 1 2minutes of live gameplay . maybe that's why it doesn't keep m interest .
511,23,agent_1,"the nfl also is using tracking chips in shoulder pads to record moves and footballs to track velocity , rotation , ball speed and location . i guess you have to perform without excuses !"
512,23,agent_2,"yeah , football is a serious sport ! you can als see how importnat it is by the teschnology that is developing . apparently , espn won an emmy for crating the uperimposed yellow line ."
513,23,agent_1,"if you go to the eagles , you have to watch yourb ehavilor because they had a temporary court set up in their stadium for six years due t6ot heir fans bad behavior !"
514,23,agent_2,tuat is funny ! i wish people would be more into women's spots l women aren't peohibited fro mbeing in the nfl but have yet been able to meet eligibility requirements .
515,23,agent_1,that woudl be awesome for them to show their skills someday ! did you hear about the jhigh schol football team that kept playing in '65 even though their science building burned down behind them . i'm surprised they had a separat escisnce building .
516,23,agent_2,that's interesting ! will y0u be watching the superbowl ? i heard it'sc oming up
517,23,agent_1,i hope the eagles mke it again . hopefully they don't have to set up a court though
518,23,agent_2,ha . i don't usually watch football but will probably watch the superbowl . the suspense is exciting .
519,23,agent_1,"the commercials are usually fun , andw ho doesn't like good food and friends ? if you visit iowa chec koutt he pink visiting teams lcker room at university of iowa haha"
520,23,agent_2,"hey , pink isn't such a bad color . a lot of football players wear it to show support for breast cancer fighter and survivods ."
521,23,agent_1,that's true ! kiss bought into an arena footnall team and offered a contract to timt ebow . woncer if he would tak eit ? nice chatting !

525,24,agent_2,right . dijd you know women ca nplay ?
526,24,agent_1,yeah there is no written rule against them playing if they qualiy
527,24,agent_2,yeah pretty neat . the game only has 11 minutes of active play afte4 all
528,24,agent_1,yeah that is short and we are glued to teh tv for so long watching the gzme
529,24,agent_2,exactly . did you know engineers make more than them over their lifetikme ?
530,24,agent_1,i am not surprised as tehy hav4 longdr careers so more time to make money
531,24,agent_2,yeah true . did you hear about that rule for new orleans cheerleaders ?
532,24,agent_1,yeah about them not being able to eat in the same placea s teh players ?
533,24,agent_2,"ywah adn worst , they have to leave mid meal if they walk in"
534,24,agent_1,yeah it is rezlly dexist though and shold be banished
535,24,agent_2,i hopd that happens . did you know thwey are putting trakcing chips on the players now ?
536,24,agent_1,yeah they are using those to track veoocity and speed and all that stuff
537,24,agent_2,yeah i hope they can use thoses tats to make the gakes a bit safer too
538,24,agent_1,hopes so too . u of iowa painted their visitor locker room pink
539,24,agent_2,hmm i wonder why . bowelrs used to make more than footbwll players in the 60s
540,24,agent_1,yeah that is crazy . espn won anm ekmy for the superimposed yellow line
541,24,agent_2,yeah thazt is great because it has made wwrching the gawme from home m8c heasier
542,24,agent_1,true . do tou know who benjzarvus greenellis is ?
543,25,agent_1,i was unaware that the top bowlers in tu e60 smadre as much as ftop football stars .
544,25,agent_2,"ysea , most football players had regular jobs when they weren't playing so i guess it's not unrealistic for top bowlers to make more than htem during the 16i90"
545,25,agent_1,"yeah , crazy . espn won an emmyf or the creation of the superimposed yellow likne that represents the 1st down marker ."
546,25,agent_2,it's funny how it took so long for soeone o think of something as simple as putting a yellow line for a first down took ao long to be thought of
547,25,agent_1,i wonder if it was the fact tnat teh technology didn't esist at the time ?
548,25,agent_2,"it's possible , i mean now they havfe tracking chips embedded in every player's equipment , funny how far sports hws come along"
549,25,agent_1,"ibteresting , concep tthough"
550,25,agent_2,"yea , it's neat they can measure things such as velovcity , rotation , ball speed , and loca5ion"
551,25,agent_1,"well , the university of iowa's locker room is painted pink , crazy"
552,25,agent_2,"that's crazy , i wonder what color the locker rooms were for the arena football eam kiss bought"
553,25,agent_1,"i', not sure , that's a great question though , probably black and white ?"
554,25,agent_2,maybe that's hwy tim tebow never zigned with them
555,25,agent_1,"i don't blame4 him , to be honest , i think he ie ov3rrated though ."
556,25,agent_2,"yea , not a great qb , would have made a better rb , not as good as benjarvus grejeellis though , he hasn't fumbled in hus career yetr"
557,25,agent_1,"i think so too , funny you mention that . i'm not all that eurprised that the average nfl game has only 11 minutes of livef ameplay ."
558,25,agent_2,"no , it's not that surprising they only plawy 11 minutes when you think of all the time they spend between plays setting up the next play"
559,25,agent_1,"yeah , skmetimes when i'm watching a gam e, i htink taht thy do take a bir too much time running the clock out and stuff , bu toh well ."
560,25,agent_2,it' afunny how grueling the game is on your body when there ie only 11 mins of gameplaya nd 16 games a year
561,25,agent_1,"yeah , i remember reading about some players having to sit in a tub full of ice after the ga,me was over ."
562,25,agent_2,"yep , it's a rouhg sport , the eagles even had their own court room in their stadium"
563,25,agent_1,"i head aboutt hat , i'm not sure where thugh ."
564,25,agent_2,i remember a stand up comedian taked about the eaglesa having their own court in the stadium before
565,25,agent_1,"yeah , well the average bfl player makes less than an engineer over the fourse of their lifd ."
566,26,agent_1,hi . do you watch football
567,26,agent_2,"yes i do , i am especisally intereste dright now in following jordan reed to see if he will really be able to take hte nezxt step in his promising career aftter his surgery ."
568,26,agent_1,who is your team
569,26,agent_2,"well , jordan r4ed is on the redskins , so i am following them cjrrently ."
570,26,agent_1,"i see . do you know that the highest score ever in a football game occurrede in 1916 , and ghe score was 2220"
571,26,agent_2,"yes , i ahd heard that before ! i wonder how much money footblal players made in that time . i heard that in the 1960s it was only half as much as popular bowlers of thr time ."
572,26,agent_1,"yeah , that fact surprised me a lot ."
573,26,agent_2,i was zalso surprised to learn thwt espn won an emmy for creating that yellow first down line graphic on televiion . i enver realize that sports media could laso win those hollywood swards !
574,26,agent_1,i do not know how a sport progdam coul dwin an emmy . did they have an acting skill ?
575,26,agent_2,"no , i guess that the yellow line thing was so innovative for american football media coverage at the time that it was considered worthy of an award !"
576,26,agent_1,"i cinur . btw , did you know that fomrer patriot running hack benjiarvus grenee,lis never fumbled the footall in his career"
577,26,agent_2,"no , i didn't , but that's impressive . i wonder if they have used those nfl tracking chips in the shoulder pad to record his speed and velocity and stuff ?"
578,26,agent_1,i do not thijnk so because this is a new techbllogy
579,26,agent_2,"oh , that's a good point ! well either way it's too bad that football players even thast talented only make half as much as engineers"
580,26,agent_1,but it is quick money and fame .
581,26,agent_2,yeah buta lso i sounc slik ethey cotnrol your life quite a bit ! even other afhletes such as the nfl new orleans saitns cheerleaders have strict rules against ezting in a resztaurant at the same tikme as an nfl player .
582,26,agent_1,i see . did you know that nfl has no written rule against female players . they are allowed to play if they meet the requirements
583,26,agent_2,"wow , so the nfl actually treats women better as players tha nthe cheerleaders get treated apparently !"
584,26,agent_1,"i would think so . btw , nice chatting wit hyou . happy6 holiday"
585,26,agent_2,"merry christmas to you , and i'll leave you with this fun fqact : the university of iowa's lockee room provided for visiting football players is completely painted pink !"

601,27,agent_2,i know but it5 made life watching the gmae on tv that much simpler .
602,27,agent_1,"it does . i azm surprised they still have old guys easuring first downs with chains . it is 2019 and tennis uss compuers nad sensors , can't the nfk ?"
603,27,agent_2,well appwrrntly they are spendiknhg all there money on tracking chips .
604,27,agent_1,they could use it in footballs to figure it out . hey need tob e vetter . plus it would speed up play .

612,28,agent_2,"for sre , he is a golod p;ayer and good for defnse . i amn ot a saints fan too much though , i don't like how thwy treat thei rcheerleards"
613,28,agent_1,definitely od how they have a rule that they cant eat with players .
614,28,agent_2,"right , i feel that is sexist and why the otjer3 1 other teams don't say anything !"
615,28,agent_1,i am pretty sure the nmfl is still a private busines they can kind of do whatever they wan t.
616,28,agent_2,"that is a good point , lol . did you ehar abot the tracking chipe they use in shoulder pads ?"
617,28,agent_1,"something laong those lines , it tracsk there speed or something ?"

624,28,agent_2,"that is true ! that would make sese but htey are for the visitors as a calming method . it is psychology 101 , teh color soothes and makes you relaxed"
625,28,agent_1,"wow ,t hat i ssome nezt level stuff ! former atriots running back benjarvus greenellis has never fumbled a ball ."
626,28,agent_2,that is such a good feat he did . i feel all the running backs ever do now i sfumlbe the ball . he needs to teach a clinic
627,28,agent_1,"ya , even cdrazier is that average nfl game is only 11 minutes ."
628,28,agent_2,that is not a lot of time lol . it taeks the game from start to finish like 3 hours lol
629,28,agent_1,"exzctly , well great chatting ."
630,28,agent_2,"you too , i hope your night i awesome !"
631,29,agent_1,"hello there , do you follow the nfl at all ?"
632,29,agent_2,"kind of , bu tonly in passing , i would jot say i was an footba,l expert ."
633,29,agent_1,"i am not an expert myself , but i follow3 enough to know what is going on , and i watch all my favorite teams games ."
634,29,agent_2,what would be your favorite nfl teams ? are they any good ?
635,29,agent_1,"i ike the ;packers , they weren't very good this season , it was a bummer ."
636,29,agent_2,"i live in north east ohio , i think fans around ehre would gladoy swap the paocers records for the bronws ."
637,29,agent_1,"yeha the browns have had some toug htimes since i have been watching , much better season this oe thzn last though ."
638,29,agent_2,"i guess there ia always someone worse than yourself ,j ust heard about the team that lost 2220 . that musf have hurt ."
639,29,agent_1,"that sounds awful , i wonder how may cub,erland fans were still in the stands when that game ended ?"
640,29,agent_2,"or if they cme back the following week . i guess you have to stick with your team through tbick and thin , but that might have pushing the limit ."
641,29,agent_1,"yeah that is the test of a true fan , that you might be critical of the management , but you always stay a fan ."
642,29,agent_2,would you be a true fan if you ended up in the court set up in the stadium of thew eagles . in europe they call those type o fan sthe ultras .
643,29,agent_1,geah i have heard a bit about sojme of th3e ultras in european leagues and down in south aemrica as wlel . i'm a big fan ocf intenrational football .
644,29,agent_2,"what always mazes me is college football and itd size , almost seem as big as profwssional football , i can't think of anoturer amateur splort with that much of a following ."
645,29,agent_1,that is true and the size of the stadiums for college and evenh igh school footbal is insane .
646,29,agent_2,"i know , the high school football coach is a minor xelebrity around hsre , i can't say that fo rany of the teachers ."
647,29,agent_1,yeah i thuink the highest paid people in most states are collrg4e coaches .
648,29,agent_2,"not sure how i feel about that ? i have to swend two kjds through college on eday , qith the high cost of college i'm not sure i want a portion going to the football coach ."
649,29,agent_1,yeah ots pretty crazyt o me just how much it costs to attend colelge these day s.
650,29,agent_2,"still you kind of have to go . if yo7 want to be an engineer , at least one that has career earnings more then most football players ."
651,29,agent_1,"tha tis true , well it wasn ice talking with you today , i hope you have a goo dday !"
652,30,agent_1,"hello there , are you a fna of football ?"
653,30,agent_2,"ia m a fan , what about you ?"
654,30,agent_1,"i am as well , did you watch the super bowl this past5 sundag ?"
655,30,agent_2,"i did , i waa rooting for hte patriots , what about you ? the game was really close and really defensive no tsure if i liked it"
656,30,agent_1,"yeah i didn't like that it was so low scoring and mostly defense , it does not make for n exci8ting game . i was partial toe ither , but i am impressed by the patriots domination of the league the last 2 decades ."
657,30,agent_2,"its actually the superbowl with the fewest points scored , snd the patriots have done things right that is fcor sure , they used to havse a reat player called benjarvus gree nellis ."
658,30,agent_1,yeah did you kow he never had a fumble inb his ebtire career ! ? that is very impressive .
659,30,agent_2,"i know , that is really impressive ! ji bet only a few playersh ave accomplished that , maybe he is the only one , did you know that espn won an emmy because of tbe creatfion of the first down line"
660,30,agent_1,yeah that is an interesting fact . i am trying to think if i cwn remember watching game sbefore tehy put that yellow line up there .
661,30,agent_2,the yellow line has been there a long time and i thin kthat the emmy is well deserved ad it hs definetely contributed with a lot to the game .
662,30,agent_1,"yeah i think it has toally changed how people were albe to watch and cheer , it makes so much of a difference ."
663,30,agent_2,"it does , i gusess thats why fames were so unfair in old times , there was a team that lost by 222 poitjns"
664,30,agent_1,"yeah isn't that crazy , i wonder if there were any defense playing that day at all !"
665,30,agent_2,"i know , it seems like the other tea mwas blind or they were all ijjured , another inteesting fact is thatb owlers made more than football players back i n2960"
666,30,agent_1,"yeah i thought that was pretty wild . i guess if i got the chance o do it again , i would b ea pro bowler in the 60's !"
667,30,agent_2,"i guess thats a safer sport , football has proven to cause a lot of brain damage in players so thats not good ."
668,30,agent_1,"ueah it has , if you ever watch the movie concussion , with will smiht , it definitley makes you thin ktwice abou how much damage the sport does to ones body and brain most of all ."
669,30,agent_2,"i think ive seen tht film before , 9 will google it later or maybe its availwble iun netflix , there is a crazy rules the new orlans saints have , its really sexis and rude in fac t."
670,30,agent_1,yeah that rule seemss o outdated and dumb . i can't believe that is an actual rule .
671,30,agent_2,"i know right , i mean cheerleaders could actually sue the team for sometuing lie that , its a rule that should be abolisehd"
672,30,agent_1,"yeah i couldn't agree more . well it was nice talkingw ith you today , i hope you have a good day ."
673,31,agent_1,are you a nfl fan ?
674,31,agent_2,i am not . are you ?
675,31,agent_1,yeah i enjpy warchijh fhe nfl . . i think there's 32 teams in the nfl .
676,31,agent_2,"what is your favorite team ? it is surprising how much the nfl has gained in popularity . in the6 0s , top bowlers made twic ea much as top football stars ."
677,31,agent_1,"i really like hte titans . however , the uarterback is out with an injury ."
678,31,agent_2,"oh , sorry to hear . i guess i am not into football because there are only 11 minutes of live gameplay ."
679,31,agent_1,bu ti's 11 minutes if action ! ! the super bowl will be coming u;p soon . .
680,31,agent_2,i hear it's th efirst sunday in february . i might get togther with some friends to socialize .
681,31,agent_1,it sure is . . usually the day after my birthday . . .t he highest scoring game in footbal lwas 1916 georgia teach beat cumberland 22q20 . . they must have bad offense and defensive .
682,31,agent_2,"wow , how is that even possible ? it's interesting how there is so much tecnoloyy used these days in foobtall ."
683,31,agent_1,riht . . especially te graphics on television . .
684,31,agent_2,i heard espn won an emmy for the supefrimposer yellow line
685,31,agent_1,i bet . that was brilliant ! ! i wonder if wome ncan play in the nfl ?
686,31,agent_2,"i read that theyaq ctually can , if they can meet requirements . sadly no women have yet ."
687,31,agent_1,this is nuts . . if a saint's dheerleader is eating in a resraurant and a football player showe up htey have to leave . they aren't allowed to eat at the same restaurnat as the players . i wonder why ?
688,31,agent_2,"yes , it seems unfair tjat he cheerleaders have to leave nad never thwe players ."
689,31,agent_1,extremely sexist ! !
690,31,agent_2,undded . i 2onder ho wthey can still get away with it .
691,31,agent_1,i'm not sure . there is no good reasin for that rule .
692,31,agent_2,"and also it seems that being a football player may not be all it's cracked out to be . an engineer actually ,akes more i na lifetime !"
693,31,agent_1,eight an their bodies probably aren't hat banged up likd a football player .
694,32,agent_1,"hello t5here , do you follow the nfl at al l?"
695,32,agent_2,i love the nfl . what about you ?

700,32,agent_1,"yeauh i heard about htat , i wonder whog ave the final ok for that to be done , i bet tehy weren't overly pc lol ."
701,32,agent_2,not too sure lol . teh 1960's top bowlers made twice as much as the top ngl stars .
702,32,agent_1,"that is so crazy , it just showd how much bigger the nfl has gotten since then ."
703,32,agent_2,i agree . vbowlers probably don't mak4 a whole lot these days .
704,32,agent_1,"no not 5thessed a7s , but i still think it would b pretty sweet to make a living throwing thoseb alls around , loys of women too lol ."
705,32,agent_2,that would be pretty awesome . gotta love the attention too . lol
706,32,agent_1,"oh yeah , greasy hands , thin crust frozen pizza , and lots of high life beer ."
707,32,agent_2,lo l! the highest score ever in a football game was 2220 .
708,32,agent_1,"holty crap , i think i have read about that , oh cumberland so sorry fo ryou lol ."
709,32,agent_2,yea that is bad . greenellis has never fumbled th efootball in his entire nfl career .
710,32,agent_1,"that is very impressive , i wonder how many total carries he had ?"
711,32,agent_2,"not sur on that , but i know he was a starter so i'd imagine a lot of carried ."
712,32,agent_1,yeah thats true he was so oprobqbly ad ecen5 amount you are right .
713,32,agent_2,"in the nfl , there is no written rule against womne playig ."
714,32,agent_1,i think it would bes uper cool if a female player made a roster and goft to see some rela gametime . nice chatting with you today !
715,33,agent_1,do you watch the nfl ?
716,33,agent_2,"a little , you ? i can't watch like i use to years ago so im not current ."
717,33,agent_1,which of the 32 team is your favorite ?
718,33,agent_2,well back in the day it was the green bay packers . not sure how they rank these days though . so it's the national football league which consist of the afca nd the nfc righ t?
719,33,agent_1,"yep , 16 in each i think . i qm a vikings fan . what are your thoughts o nteh saints"
720,33,agent_2,nothing really liek i said haven't watch in whuile . whyw hat do you now ? i am aware tha6 they plan to put trackinf hcips ijn player padding as well as the footballs .
721,33,agent_1,"if their cheereladers are eatng at a restaurant and teh players come , htey have to leave , kind o fsexist"
722,33,agent_2,i think so . do you know in austria rugby is considr to be football ?
723,33,agent_1,"i did not kjow3 that , that s more brutal i think . i wonder if theikr actual gameplay lasts longer than then fls 11 minutes"
724,33,agent_2,so many commercials i guess because that's hard ro bleieve . do you know about the high school in allen texas ?
725,33,agent_1,"cor sure , what about that school ?"
726,33,agent_2,"there is a high school in allen texae that seats 18 , 000 ppl and cxost 60 milluon to build ."
727,33,agent_1,"wow , i heard that a while ago . waste of tax payer koney . do you have w favorite college team ?"
728,33,agent_2,i don't i ever only watched pro if given a chance . i it much different ?
729,33,agent_1,"not too muh , i am an iowa hawkeye fan , they paint the visiting locker room pink !"
730,33,agent_2,"haha , that might just make m emad and want to win even more . so how do you feel about the tracking chips they are about to start using in the pro's ?"
731,33,agent_1,"for sure it is supposed to calm them downl o l. i heard baout that , probably made my engineer swho make more money than nfl players do in their lifetime"
732,33,agent_2,"yeah i get htat but give me the 1015 wd i'm out not the 4r050 , you know ! so do you know how long a regular season last ?"
733,33,agent_1,"i dont know how long it lasts , how long ?"
734,33,agent_2,i believe 17 weeks but every team gets a nye week so they play 16 games a season .
735,33,agent_1,nice tlaking to you !
736,34,agent_1,"hi turker , are you a fan o nfl , if yes do you watc thursday night footblal ?"
737,34,agent_2,"i am a fan , my thursday nihgts woulfn't be the samew ithou that sacred sport , what about you ?"
738,34,agent_1,"i feel the same way , i like thursday nihgt football and i hope nothing change ."
739,34,agent_2,"it seems like the thursday packages isnt going anywhere so that is a good thin , did you know dcisney is rhe owner of abc and espn ?"
740,34,agent_1,"no i had no idea , since disnet always had it own channle , they mus thave recently brought abc and espn ."
741,34,agent_2,"yeah seems like they are buying everything thjese days , star wars , marvel and now those two channelz as well"
742,34,agent_1,"wow , disney doing good , i knew there was the disney channel for many years , when i was wsmall that was my favorite channel ."
743,34,agent_2,"it was eat channel i liked it as well , crazy gow much money tvm oves and also ho wmuch moeny football moves , 90 0million for thursday night games alone"
744,34,agent_1,"wow it's amazing , did you know espn is laying off large numbers of workers ?"

746,34,agent_1,"i used to , but not any more since they got older , after that seems like things wasn't the same ."
747,34,agent_2,"well its a rezlly funny show , it has an average of 18 million viewers . the nbc has great series in it ."
748,34,agent_1,"yes i read about thw viewers , did you k,now tha twoemn has a chance to play in the nfl if they meet eligibility ?"
749,34,agent_2,"i didnt know about that , hwast do you thijk about that rule ? would you liie to watch a woman int he nfl ?"
750,34,agent_1,"i don't think so , because this will change the entire paste of the game , i don't think 25 0and 300 lbs menwould want to fackle women head on , i would like to see a wnfl , women only ."
751,34,agent_2,"ueah i dont think its a good sport to mix genres , do you know who matt patricia is ?"
752,34,agent_1,"no i don't hav eany ideal , does hse have something to do with tne nfl ?"
753,34,agent_2,"matt patricia is a male lol , he is a rocket scientist and also a coach in the nfl"
754,34,agent_1,"wow , i feel a little embarrassed for not knowing that , first chance i get i wil lread upon h8m ."
755,34,agent_2,"patricia its a girls name so don't worry kts na honest mistake , eh must be a really smart guy though being a rocket scientist and all"
756,34,agent_1,i thougth it was a woman at first . did you know that only 11 minutes of libe playtime in a nfl game ?
757,34,agent_2,"no didn't know that , 11 minutes of live playtime doesn't seem right , anyways im getting kind of tired , its late so im going to capll it a night ."
758,34,agent_1,"yes you are rihgt , it was nice chatting with you also , good night ."
759,35,agent_1,did you know that minnie mouse's name is short for minerva ? haha that is weird
760,35,agent_2,"i had no clue , i apso didn't know disney wasf ounde dby roy disney 6oo"
761,35,agent_1,"no i didn't know that , or that walle was named after walter elias disney , i wonder if that is walt disney's son ?"
762,35,agent_2,"i wonder tol , ig uess there i sa lot of obscure disney stuffl ike hiddeb mkckey mouse images"
763,35,agent_1,"yes , i 4emember reading about how they put hieden images in their movies , i bet there is a blog or youtube channel tha tshowcases a lot of it , very strange too that bill nye was a consultant for the cisney movie flubber , i remember that movie was not good haha"
764,35,agent_2,lo lno and i don't think it was that sdcietnifically accuate . i don't see why they didn't just put bill nye in the movie .
765,35,agent_1,"haha rhat would have improved the movie for sufe , i like robuin williams too , tha tmovie was just a real stinker , did you liek big hero 6 ?"
766,35,agent_2,"don't know much about ig hero 6 besides all the toys they seem to sell , apparetnly it took a 55 , 000 core computer to render it"
767,35,agent_1,"ya i was wondering about that , i thouhgt the movie was only ok , threrea re definitely better diseny animated movies , but i'm ol dmaybe i'm biased to ute classics and not their newer stuff"
768,35,agent_2,well they have been makijg movies since 1923 so there is probably a liot better movies out there
769,35,agent_1,"yes they have a long history , do you watch football t all ?; i know a little about it and i will be watching the ahperbowl , but i don't persobally really care what happens with the teams"
770,35,agent_2,"yea , i follow football , mostly the giants , it's hard to keep up with all3 2 teams"
771,35,agent_1,"ya i agree , for me it seems kind of boring , and apparenlty 5there is , on average , only 11 minutes of actualg ameplay in a given nfl game , that is like nothing"
772,35,agent_2,it's crazy ho wthere is zn averaghe of 11 minutes of gamplay and 16 games a season
773,35,agent_1,"yyp , so not a lot of actual gameplay butl ots of commercials and lots of watching men standing still waiting to hike the ball haha , i'll be thinking about that during the superbowl this yea5"
774,35,agent_2,lots of injuries and stats too . all the players have chips embedded int heir shoulder pads
775,35,agent_1,"yes i think that wouldb e useful for tracking allk inds of stats , thats almost like a videogame at that poin twith the stats you could get , also weird that the average engineer makes more in th3ir lifetime than the average nfl player"
776,35,agent_2,well in the 60s top bowlersx made more than football starts lo l. i guess football carees are quite xhort
777,35,agent_1,"ya that must be what it is , that is funny bsecause today it isa the complete reverse , also crazy that the fnl would allow a female player if she could me4t the requirements , i9 think we will se ea female nfl player in our ,ifetime"
778,35,agent_2,yea since there is no rules againstf emal eplayers ic an see one become a place kicker
779,35,agent_1,"i was thinking htat ya , nothing would stop them from becoming a kicker . i think a linebacker might be too juch though , that would be a massive woman . haha"
780,36,agent_1,did you know that disney owns abc as well as espn ?
781,36,agent_2,i did . do ylu watch football ?
782,36,agent_1,"yes i do , i am a contributor to the number one rankng for viewership of sundeay night football . do you ?"
783,36,agent_2,i watch it sometimes . i don't usually watcgh thrsday night football tough .
784,36,agent_1,"yeah , me neither , do you have a favorite sports team ?"
785,36,agent_2,"i do , i lioes tje redskins . what about you ?"
786,36,agent_1,i like the dallas cowboys because i grew up there and luckily th echeerleaders sarehn't treated like the saints cheelreaders where they are forbidden from eating in the dame restaurants as the nfpl players .
787,36,agent_2,interesting . apparently the qverage nfl game has only 11 minutes of live gameplay .
788,36,agent_1,that's super short and yet i find myself deviting a whole afternoon or evening to watching hte game . so the llayers don't technically have to be in rela goor shape then right ?
789,36,agent_2,"yeah , i usually go out . but i can believe that it is only 11 minutes ."
790,36,agent_1,yeah but they p4obably need time to play those expensive axds but wherr is all that money gling if the averag elifetime earnings of an engineer is higher than the earnings of a nfl player ?
791,36,agent_2,"yeah . i can believe htat , engineers make good money in some paces ."
792,36,agent_1,i'd imagine petroleum engineers mkae a lot of money too . i have yet to see ay fmdal eplayers play in the nfl ev3en tnough here are no written rules againstt hem from playin .
793,36,agent_2,"yeah , there were female players when i was in high school though ."
794,36,agent_1,"oh wow , did they have to meet the physical requirements or anything ? did the females shar teh same locker rooms as the males ?"
795,36,agent_2,i'm not sure . not when i was ins ch9ol . the one player was a wire receiber .
796,36,agent_1,"oh ok . like football , i laso watch a lot of disney movies ,m y favorite re the animations by pixar , such as walle , have you seen it ?"
797,36,agent_2,i've watched some good disney movies in my day . minni iss hortf or minerva .
798,36,agent_1,"i didn't know that , that's also not a common first nam either . i qwonder ic yhere are people hamed after the character . perhaps a pet or something ."
799,36,agent_2,"yeah , and spparently bill nye was a consultant for flubber ."
800,36,agent_1,is that how billp nye got his bif break ? hew as the consultant and thenh realized taht he could also become an entertqainer as well . i like watching him too !
801,37,agent_1,"oy , i miss footbqll season . i love espn's monday night football offerings . what about you ?"
802,37,agent_2,i don't really watch it though sometimes i inadvertently end up watching thursday night football .
803,37,agent_1,"ah , yes . during football season , it can be hard to not catch at least part of a gmae . did you know abc id the on,y one of the 4 major broadcdast networks without a primetime nfl gam3 ?"
804,37,agent_2,"i heard disney owns bac and espn so they are condidering bidding on the cbs and nbc football pack,age ."
805,37,agent_1,"yes . i twould seem like a smart investment . eight of the top 10 single telecasts were nfl games , including the super bowl li , which was number 1 ."
806,37,agent_2,"abc hasn't had prime time nfl since 2005 , when it moved to espn . is it still on espn ? that would then make it more accessible to more people if it wer eon abc ."
807,37,agent_1,"it is on espn for noaw . but , esp nis laying offl arge numbers of workers . it seems some nfl players do not love the idea of htursday gqmes though . richard sherman , who plays for the seahawks , said it's too sgort if you've just played a sunday game . he said yourb ody is still sore ."
808,37,agent_2,that makes sense . i dd a color run last week and am stil sore . then again i'm not a5hletic . haha !
809,37,agent_1,i can't imaginr how sore they must be . an average nrl game only has 11 minutes of live gameplay ! sl few minutes for such pain !
810,37,agent_2,"rigth , and that's part of the reson football doesnt' interest me , not a lot of ive gameplay . i wlso get lost sometimes . the supetimposed yellow lien helps out a bit . espn won an emmy for that ."
811,37,agent_1,"they deserved it ! that really helped me ! it looks a little cartoonish , but hey , i love cartoons , especially disney !"
812,37,agent_2,"me too ! my favorite character is minnie . i don't reallyg like her ful name , minerva ."
813,37,agent_1,they are so clever with their names ! did you know that walle was named as a tip of the hat to wa;ter eliasa disney ?
814,37,agent_2,"oh , i could have figured that out but i ddn't haha ! wall e is so cute . have you foudn any hidden mickey mouse images in other disney films ?"
815,37,agent_1,"i havem't . . . yet ! i just got clued ino that subculture recently . i wonder if tgere are hudden images al lthe wzy back to the companys' founding , back on october 16 , 192 ? i nay have a lot of catching up to do !"
816,37,agent_2,"yeah , me too . gives me a reason to rewatch everything . wonder if there are any in bigh ero 6 . i haven't seen that but it was made using a 55 , 000 core supercomputer ."
817,37,agent_1,"they really do use technology , don't they ? they even got bill nye to be a science consultant for flubgber ! they'v ecome a long way since 1923 !"
818,37,agent_2,and hey have grown to 14 theme parksa roud the world . i've only been to one q
819,37,agent_1,"who would have guess that from their start in animatyion they w9uld brnach out to theme parks , live acti9n film , and even sort oft he nfl !"
820,37,agent_2,"yeah , i bet their merchandise is a big par tof it too . i love to collect it ."
821,37,agent_1,i forgot all about the merchandise ! i wond4r if there are any minnie mouse or nfl crossovrrd olls ?
822,37,agent_2,"haha , there shoukd be . i feel like ther eare ? or maybe i'm thinking oft he nfl potato head i have . peakign of whicu , time ro clean up a bit . see you !"
823,38,agent_1,go0od morning ! hope your day is going well
824,38,agent_2,it is going well . i'm considering catching a movie what will you do today ?
825,38,agent_1,"i'm working today , looking forward to the weekend and some relaxation . toob ad fotball season is over it'sf un to waste away a sunday watching football !"
826,38,agent_2,i agree patript sdid their job too bad for the rams . i think i'll catch a disne6 movie ther alp and the intenret sounds good that's a sequel to a movie that was in hte works for a long time !
827,38,agent_1,"yep , not a fan of either team , but the patriots are amazjing probably wont see a run like this atain , and they're not done ! , . my kids saw wreck it ralph 2 and loved it , disney does a good job"
828,38,agent_2,"can the patriots keep it up forever , that's the key i think the risks og football a5re a bit high , howeve r. i'm glad disney keeps at it . of course disneyland , all the hype and all the merchandise , makes moviemaking well worth it ."
829,38,agent_1,"tom brady and bill bilichek will keep goign forever ! neither wants to be proven that they catn win without the other . disney movies are starting tor ehash the classics , but like you said with all the merch , how can y9u blame them ? ! ? !"
830,38,agent_2,"did you eve rwonder how tv gers all those great sot sof plays at the foogtball games apparently they use 5tracking chips embexded in syoulder pads yikes , someone is always watching you ! i liked that commercial about theg uy going to ehaven and getting the new car fro mhis grandpa then he woke up and was in his cubicle at work and someone had heimleched him so funn !"
831,38,agent_1,i've heard about the tracking chips in the pads or on players and i wonder why the don't put a chip in the ball so they know when it breaks the plain of the end zone ? i don't thibk i've seen the commerckal you mention was it on during thes b ?
832,38,agent_2,good iddea about the end zone . the commercial was in the supe rbowl and cracked em up because wehen the guy recovered after being apparently gone for a bit it was back to wo9rk and he rewlly wanted the car ! so funny !
833,38,agent_1,i guess i tuned out the commercials like oi tuned out mo0st of the sb game . . . . and our game ofs quares was terrible !
834,38,agent_2,"sounds like you are a big fan finny fact , asn average engineer makes more in his lifetime than the average pro footabll player i think negineering is safer ."
835,38,agent_1,"tuat doesn't surprise me at all , given the average career in 5h enfl ixs less than 3 years and while the superstars makd a ton , the average guy doesn't"
836,38,agent_2,i think that the political controversies of the past few years hasn't helled the sportt oo much some people just want to watch folks paly ball . is ee the patriots owne ris in trouble today so that's another negative out there . back to disney are there any animation films up for oscars this year ?
837,38,agent_1,"i heard about the massave parlor thing on the radio shocking ! ! ! i think ralph hreaks the internet is up for a noscar . isle of dogs will win , i think"
838,38,agent_2,isn't the incredibels 2 movie out th3ere as well ? my kids saw it and liked it sounds like it hqd some dark moments too maybe beyond littel jids ages . speakin gof footsbll salaries a fun fact in the 60's a profesional bowler madem lre than an nfl player .
839,38,agent_1,my kids loke incredibles 2 too ij ust realized my kids see many movies without me . . . . i wonder how much moneyt op pro bolwers make ? most of the professionla athletes didn't makem uch money until the tv revdnue started rolling in and popularity of the superstars
840,38,agent_2,i'm sure tv had a lot to do with it . ankother fun fac tthe highwst scoring game wws in 1916 when georgia tech defeated cumber4land 212 to 0 . ouch . poor coach !
841,38,agent_1,talk about a blow out ! cumberland folded it's prograqm after that game i get . . . .
842,38,agent_2,i bet rhe coac hchanged careers aftsr that how can you carry on with taht on your resume . i guess thi8s will bw turn 10 righ t? should we wrap it up ? hope you have a good day if that'z true .
843,38,agent_1,great chatting wit hyou have a great day !
844,39,agent_1,the ros3nane reboot did not las tlong did it ?
845,39,agent_2,"not with he ron it . ih eard i is still oing , but maybe under a differentn ame ."
846,39,agent_1,"the original show was kind of good . itw as not ' california ' pretty , but showed middle class . unusual for the day ."
847,39,agent_2,"very much so , it also showed real struggles , which didnt happen much either ."
848,39,agent_1,i suppose the unrral part of tbe show is the way we all get to comment . sara silverman ' loved ' the reboot .t here are many others .
849,39,agent_2,everyone has the right to their opinion . sometimres it is just best for those int he public eye to be careful how they state theirs .
850,39,agent_1,"so , rosanne was a trump supporter , the sister wa snot , on the show , , do you think that the portrayal of trump supporters was unteal in some way ?"
851,39,agent_2,"i didn't watch i t. but i heard that the portratzl caused some problems , because it treat3d politics as irrelevant ."
852,39,agent_1,"irrelevant must be a hollywood buzzword . south par k, a leader in irrelevance , aired a spoof of family guy , as how about irrelevance . itm akes my h2ole argument irrelevant ."
853,39,agent_2,i wonder if that made the flowers they got from the simpsoms crew . . . . irrelevant . . lol
854,39,agent_1,it might have . i can not remembrer the episode o fsikmpsons wh3re ar neither appears or is emntioned . do you know what that one was about ?
855,39,agent_2,"i dont , honestlt i dont even recall that pisode . there are so many of them ."
856,39,agent_1,"yes . there ar so many . the ideas are repeaing . there are over 750 epoisodes of pokeman , thats 50 a year for 16 yars . some times you have to end a show when ites time ."
857,39,agent_2,"yeah , like 15 yeaqrs ago . . . . lol"
858,39,agent_1,i always wondered who narrated thomas tge tank engine . that was a nice relaxing show . those troublesome trucks are at it again .
859,39,agent_2,"well you might recognize some voicrs , ringo star and alec baldwin each did 52 episodes ."
860,39,agent_1,tjen there was george carljn and the seven words you can never say .
861,39,agent_2,i love carlind explanation of the f word as al lparts of pech .
862,39,agent_1,that is a classic thing . he has done a lot over tbe years . do you suppose he would like the 3 horizontal lines form enu it3ms being called a hamburger icon ? carlin might not have likd computers .
863,39,agent_2,"yeah , i jus tcall that ghe menu button . i dont kno3 where hamburgr came from ."
864,39,agent_1,"hamnurgers cause me joy . constant novelty from cic,kign links cause addiction . mayb ethere nee dbe no otherr elatikn ."
865,40,agent_1,how do you feel about internet use these days ?
866,40,agent_2,"it is ver6 necezsary for communication purpose , to known anythign happening int he different part of the world . over all , it is very g9od ."
867,40,agent_1,did you know that pople can become addicted to clicking links on the int5ernet because of the constant novelty ?
868,40,agent_2,yes . we use it whenever necessary otherwise we suffer grom it . online shopping is biggest revenue for all companies 5through internet .
869,40,agent_1,htat's interestigt o think about . did you kno2 fhat the linrary of alexandra ahs a safed copy of the internet in vase it al; falls apart ? i wonder what that looks liie . what medium do you think it's saved oin ?
870,40,agent_2,i have no idea about it .
871,40,agent_1,seems like you'd need something pretty big to save a vcopy of the whole internet ! i think yesterday was the anniversary of it's invention wasn't it ? i though i saw that o ngoogle .
872,40,agent_2,mobile itnernet connectivity played an important in access the internet in the recent years . smartphone play a major role in it .
873,40,agent_1,"how that all works is craay to me , wireless internet stil lblows my mind . did you know that you can get 3g cell service at the top of mount everesft ? ?"
874,40,agent_2,it is very interesting . email is the important communicqtion service which is availabel in internet . now days postals ervice is reduced due to ity .
875,40,agent_1,i awonrder if that?s a goo dor a bad thing ultimately ? i know there are al ot of jobs that people aren't interested in having n0wadays i woxder if mail carrier is one of them ? also less paper is probably a good thing too right ?
876,40,agent_2,"some people stopped readingn ewspaper , they simply using app for news also . ordering food throiugh interhet . data sharing is the main feature in the internet . we able to send file to friends , staff etc . . ."
877,40,agent_1,"that's interesting , and since everyone carries phones around these days all those things are easy to do"
878,40,agent_2,yes . television is a mass emdium for advertising and entersainmenf . it earns largest revenue through ads omnly .
879,40,agent_1,i wonder how that's been affected by netflix these days .
880,40,agent_2,"lot of changes in size and technology of television , after second world war only black and white television are availahle . tv serial are very famous and t has large numbe rof fans ."
881,40,agent_1,ther eare a lot of long running shows on tv still surprisingly . did you know there are over 750 episodes f pokmeon ?
882,40,agent_2,"pokemon is liek of most of kids . in early stage , heavy cathode tube can be replaced by the flat panel technology , lcd . thnere are so manhy developent ."
883,40,agent_1,"tv has changed a lot these days you're right ! i still remember having a ginat heavy tv growing up , and now they are so flat and light !"
884,40,agent_2,"tv composed of multiple internazl circu9ts include the turner for receiving the decoder for broadcast signasl . now we are using digital technology , via internet also ."
885,40,agent_1,that's true i remember when the converter boxes were a big selle4r . did you ever watch that7 0's suow ?

891,40,agent_1,that's tfue it hink it's called different thjngs in different places though right ?
892,40,agent_2,everyone in finland has the right to an internety connecton .
893,40,agent_1,"that's interesting , do you think that itnerney access tehre is free then ?"
894,40,agent_2,licnoln was the first pre4sident to ne photographed for his inauguration .
895,40,agent_1,"that's inte5esting , well it was nice chattign with you bye !"
896,40,agent_2,bye !
897,40,agent_1,have an ice day !
898,41,agent_1,the reskins reallyn eed alex smith back in locker room andf more importantly on the field dont you think
899,41,agent_2,alex smith as a great asset . hw fook the time to really gey a feel for people
900,41,agent_1,its a shame that he is seeing the sams troubles as grtiffin did . its uncany .
901,41,agent_2,he was in the league a long time . at least he gavr the game everything he had
902,41,agent_1,i dinst' think he was all that of a qb but his teammates really took to him right away
903,41,agent_2,he was a true professionla .
904,41,agent_1,i don't think xmith will be the same even if he does make it back to the field after his gruesome injury . much like grivffin he might be a back up but thats all
905,41,agent_2,well at least he will get back up . thankfully since th4e nfl uses tracking chips they can track players moves and help avoid cdazy injuries
906,41,agent_1,he does have an education to help too ; hd has a masters degree
907,41,agent_2,ydah he is clearly smarth aving earned his degree so 2quickly
908,41,agent_1,"one qb i don't like it baker mayfoeld , i wish he would have stuck to professional gaming instead of football"
909,41,agent_2,i'm confusedr as to wnhy the saints cheerleaders cant eat in the same restaurantas teh players that seems like an absurd rule
910,41,agent_1,it is ; proof of the hypocrisy of nfl ahd its rules
911,41,agent_2,you needn't look hard to find proof oft hsat
912,41,agent_1,this year's 17 weeks eason has wrapped up and now its playoff time
913,41,agent_2,i wonder who will be 6he nfc and afc chams that will go to the superbowl in feb
914,41,agent_1,it is likely that we will only see 11 minytes of actual gameplay no matter who plays
915,41,agent_2,yes no ot this year
916,41,agent_1,do you think we aill ever se a femsle in the nfl ?
917,41,agent_2,its not against the rules so it is likely someone isr aising thef irst feamle nfl player as we speak
918,41,agent_1,i hope to see at least s field goal kicker as a 3oman
919,42,agent_1,hey 5here dix you ever watch 6he reboot of roseanne ?
920,42,agent_2,i did not watch the eboot . was it a good rrboot ? i do not usually like rehoots .
921,42,agent_1,"i thought it was ok . it wasn't as good as the originla but i did get some laughs out of it . , what do you think abou tthe presiden tby the way"
922,42,agent_2,i think he ahs a very ornage complexion .
923,42,agent_1,well apparently there is a presidemt in zimbabwe called president banana
924,42,agent_2,they cou.ld do a musical number . i think htat many fans would follow .
925,42,agent_1,see i lkike that idea haha . maybe they could make a lot of money so that trump could be back into the top htee rifchest presidents of all time
926,42,agent_2,"he should have all three slots realistkcal.y . he is popular enough fkor 1st 2dn and 3rd place , like in his beaut contests ."
927,42,agent_1,"haha , wha5 do you think they'l labout going back to the rule sbefore 1805 wehre thev ice president was the runnerup candidate ?"
928,42,agent_2,that was some sort of punishment to himiliate the loser . it was there to make sure that the history books recorded the loser in the white house .
929,42,agent_1,haha well all i know is that hving vicw president clinton would be a very crazy thing with president trump lol that would be s lot of drama
930,42,agent_2,i think that it would spark new romance in the oval office . the two of them have been making googoo eyes at each other fort he longest time . she sent him all kin dof emails too .
931,42,agent_1,yeah i would like to see that lol anywsy do you use the in6ternet a lot ? have you ever clicked on a hamburger button before
932,42,agent_2,i click on the hamburger button to order food for my cell . th eguards bring it then . it is not always jambu5gers though .
933,42,agent_1,the name hamburger button makes me hungry lol it even looks like a hamburger because it has three horizontal lines on it
934,42,agent_2,that is tye stragnest of names for a button . it has no condiments on it ? how is that a hamburfgef ? hm .
935,42,agent_1,"speaking of the interjet though , did you know that omly 7 percent of people readt eh full terms of service 9nline ? mayeb ther eare hidden hamburger buns on that page lol"
936,42,agent_2,the termks are usually written in chiense or spanish por something else . that's why peopel don't read them .
937,42,agent_1,"haha well that mqkes sense tne , have you ever visited mount everest byt he way ? apparently they d0 hav einternet wccess at the peak"
938,42,agent_2,"thrre was a field tript o mt everest , but my pareh5s would not sign the permission slip so i did jot go . i guess tje internet up there must be pretty p8re and natural ."
939,42,agent_1,"lol well maybe i will go one day and take a selfie at the top , at least i know that i will have a working phone with jnternet access up there"
940,43,agent_1,did you know that hugh laurie ist he highest paid tv actor evet ?
941,43,agent_2,"hi ! no i did not know that , very interesting ! i was reading an article about the patrrijots josh mcdaniels justm ight take a coaching position ! do you watch football ?"
942,43,agent_1,"i do s little bit , i wantt be patriots to win tomorrow , what about you ?"
943,43,agent_2,"yes , i don' 6folow it v3ry much but i definitely like the patriots . mcdaniels has been one of teh highest pqid coordinator , crazy !"
944,43,agent_1,"ya that is crazy , did you know that kellan moord i sleft handed ? hes th only pne in the fnl"
945,43,agent_2,"wow , you would think there would be more lseft handers ! i like how the nfl hasn o rules against females if they emet requireemnts ."
946,43,agent_1,"ya i was wondering that , i can see a femlae kicker . to be hoenst we wiol probably see that in our lifetime"
947,43,agent_2,"i hope we do see females in the nfl , but man that is a tough spotrt and i cant' imaginw getting tackled . so inte5esting though that a full footblal game ha only 11 minutes of actual lice play . . . so i guess you could hang in there that long ."
948,43,agent_1,"yes that isc razy because games tae hours to watch , also crazy tyhat the nfl puts special chips in their uniforms so that they can trck things like xpeed and location"
949,43,agent_2,"i know it is crazy . i dudn't know that , very cool ! there is so much that goes oh during a football game !"
950,43,agent_1,"there is , i read tha tbaer mayfield was a halo 3 champion and could beat anyone in his campus at that game"
951,43,agent_2,"wow , hhaa that is pretty interesting ! i love the quarterbacks in football , they are the best at being a leqder for offense , love it !"
952,43,agent_1,"ya that iss true , do you watch fotball ? do you know who invented gh ehuddle"
953,43,agent_2,"i watch some football , don't have a lot of time to watch it . i think the huddle was invented by a deaf quarterback so nobody could outside the huddle could read the hand signals . . . . ."
954,43,agent_1,"haha that is true , i wonder how goo dhe was , i wonde rif he could call audibles even though he was deaf"
955,43,agent_2,"very inter4edtingt hought , how rough would gtaf be to play football while being deaf . so do you watch the superbowl , there'a a lo5 of drama this year about the nfl and superbowl ."
956,43,agent_1,"that would suck , and hes i'mk going to a party tomorroiw , i want the patriots to winw hat about you ?"
957,43,agent_2,"we always watch the superbowl , will have a couple people over but nothing big . i am rooting for the patriots though !"
958,43,agent_1,"hahak e too , do you ljke michael caine ? i guess he only got nto acting to chase3 cute girls haha"
959,43,agent_2,"haha , that's funny ! he mzde the ribht choicet o get into drmaa ! i ljke jim carrey in dram afilms but he son't do drama anymore . love his comedyt oo though l."
960,43,agent_1,"ya he di d, i should have followed in his footsteps , and i guess jon hamm taught the girl from the office , erinj , when he was a teacher ,d efinitely didn't know tghat"
961,44,agent_1,i am sad the nfl is over until the fall . watchijng the 32 teams compete till tehre is one final champion is so much fun
962,44,agent_2,"yes , i enjoy going to teh games ! what are your favorite teams ?"
963,44,agent_1,i li3ki the redskins bu tthe 11 minutes of actual gameplay can see mlike it takes hours .
964,44,agent_2,"lol , i know exactly what you mean ! omg 9its can be so frustrating !"
965,44,agent_1,"when i was a kid i always wanted to play in teh nfl ,b ut my goaql of ebing th efirst female player was not to be ."
966,44,agent_2,"aww , that's a shame , there is no rule against it . thank goodness ! what position do you like ?"
967,44,agent_1,i laways watnedt o be a wide receiver but i am pretty sure i would get squashed lik ea but . i dp not think the new orleans saintz would like it though theys eem somewhat antiwomen
968,44,agent_2,"yeah , theyn eed to change that rule ! that's not acceptable . isn't it unusual there is only one left hande qb ?"
969,44,agent_1,"that is quite strange , since leftie pitcher sare so common in baseball ."
970,44,agent_2,"true , what do yout hink of brad johnson throwing a touchdown pass to hismelf ?"
971,44,agent_1,i had nmever heard of that ! was it batted into the air and he caught it ?
972,44,agent_2,"yes , did yu know there was a coach that was a rocket scientust ?"
973,44,agent_1,"no what team did he coach ? i k,new that alex smith was a brilliant quarterback who was working kn a masters degree when he was dravted"
974,44,agent_2,his name was matt patrifia anb aeronautical engineer .
975,44,agent_1,very cool . i knew ther ewas a deaf quarterback once that was why the huddl ewas invetned
976,44,agent_2,"yes , so the other teams couldn't see his plays . i agree very cool !"
977,44,agent_1,baker mayfield almost quit football to compet9tive game full time probably a safer occupation than football !

1058,48,agent_2,"sure , until the cte shows up in brain scans years later . theres only one lefthanded quarterback in the whole league ."
1059,48,agent_1,i thought there were other left handed qbs like tebow for instance .
1060,48,agent_2,i'm just going by what the factual section says . and tbeow is a baseball player now isn't he
1061,48,agent_1,not sure but its good that alex smith has an education to fll back on now wth is major leg injury

1064,48,agent_2,its interesting that gte huddle was ceated by a dseaf quarterback
1065,48,agent_1,"yeah , that was so the other geam coulxnt' see the hand sihnals"

1068,49,agent_1,this was intense
1069,49,agent_2,if josh mcdaniels leaves the patriots for the colts that would be amazing . i'm ove rthe patriots .
1070,49,agent_1,im over them too . i went to game recently in miami and the amount of pat fans was insane
1071,49,agent_2,i guess he backed out of the offer for the colts adn stayed with the psatriots .

1074,49,agent_1,"i agree , waiting for the same ."
1075,49,agent_2,he's gtting old and wasued ut . i guess its good for mcdaniels ecause the patriots want to keep him and he's under contrac twith them .
1076,49,agent_1,"mcdaniels , opted to remain in new england"
1077,49,agent_2,i beg teh colts were disappointed .
1078,49,agent_1,"nfl observers haven't forgotten how the colts' coaching searc hwent down in february . 'w e were disappointed . unquestionably ,w e were disappointed and surprised"

1080,49,agent_1,i did not know that
1081,49,agent_2,i guess since he's consideded the best i nthe nfl he will have plenty of teams rto choose from . . tehre's 32 teams . . . i think . . .
1082,49,agent_1,i believe you are correct . i thin kits ridiuclous the amount gehy get paid though . insane

1120,51,agent_2,whuat do you reemmber from the show ? any interestimg plotlines ?

1123,51,agent_1,well maybe for teh typical american middle class family but not for all . are you a big fan of tv in general ?
1124,51,agent_2,"i don't have satelite or cable , but i do have netflix and i'llw atch some things online if someone recommends it . it;s different from classic tv , but i think it's tyhe modrrne quivalent ."

1126,51,agent_2,what avout you ? do you use internet vor tv shows ?
1127,51,agent_1,"no i don't , i have cbale , mostly to watch and recordl ive sports progtrams . i do find myself still flipping through chanels sometimes thnough . i found this awesome 2 hr progran about the beginnigns of the american circu swhich was awesome !"

1129,51,agent_1,"i noticed how much fun all of the circus performers were having . during the depression it was not a bad job to have , even h etop women performers earned as much as the men !"
1130,51,agent_2,i'm glad to hear that it waws a duiversion from the depression . it seems like that would be a welcome entertainment for a sad nation . and one without a political spin to it .
1131,51,agent_1,yeah it was fun entertainm3ent for everyone and it was such an attraction ghat people couldn't miss it when htey would come t town . the kmotion picture industry beginning hurt a bit though .
1132,51,agent_2,"the whole concept of a travelling show , only in town for a short while seems to have evaporated . widespread movies ,t v and internet entertainment make everything everpresent . i think it's overload ."
1133,51,agent_1,yeah the times hav changed for sure l like you said earlier too wi6h netflix and all changing television now as well .
1134,51,agent_2,"xo you think tehre would be a benefit , societal , not economic , to havng regional releases and a more staggered release of shows , even movies ?"
1135,51,agent_1,"maybe , but i think it's best to just let the msarket decideet hings for itself . i htink you just have to continually evolve to stay relevant no matter what the business ."
1136,51,agent_2,"yes , the market forces will be strongerd . . . i don't think it would change at all . i just fels bad not ' keelping up ' with shows and such , so i can't talk bout it with friends if i'm ' behind ' ."

1164,53,agent_2,i had her dthat . i recently discovered that they use tracking xhips in plaers pads and the football .
1165,53,agent_1,"yeah , i wonder what kinds of statistics and vitals they are collecting and using it for"
1166,53,agent_2,apparently it's just tracking every movement accurately . but i wonder why they are njot using yhat xata to make cakls instead of just relying on reviews ?
1167,53,agent_1,i am not sure some things are really strange wai5th the nfl ometimes like that rule for the new orleans cheerleaders
1168,53,agent_2,i fin dtat rule very upsetting . it seem quite sexist to me that if a cheerleader is eating first an a player enters she bhas to leave .
1169,53,agent_1,"ik now , it is so sexist and unnecesary . wom4n can play if they qualify but cannot each at the same place ? weird"
1170,53,agent_2,"yes it'w very upsetting . i'm not surprised that since the brown were reintroduced in 99 , ben roethlisberger is the qb with the most wins in their stadium ."
1171,53,agent_1,"yeah . on anotehr tipic , do you like drama ?"
1172,53,agent_2,i definitely do . how about yourself ?

1179,53,agent_1,oh y no wonder she is so funny too . what a coincidence .

1183,54,agent_2,"hi , great . you ?"
1184,54,agent_1,same . what is your favorite article ?
1185,54,agent_2,"this was cool to read . nfl uses tracking chips ebmedded in players shoulder pads to record a players every move on the i9el d. they ate also located inside fkootballs to track : velocit , rotation , ball speed and location ."
1186,54,agent_1,that is crazy . also it says rhat fnl has no writtne rule against female player . i can't picture a woman playing such a eport
1187,54,agent_2,i saw that also . i agree .
1188,54,agent_1,"i recal, once a girl tried to het on the football team of my h9gh sschool . it didnt work out well . ahd to quit"
1189,54,agent_2,really ? did she get blasted ?
1190,54,agent_1,seh did for sure . she was only 5 feet tall !
1191,54,agent_2,"i'm glad to hear they treatec her with respect , as na equal player . an average nfl game oly has 11 minute of live gamepl;ay"
1192,54,agent_1,"new orleans saints cheerleaders are forbidden from eating in the same restaurant as any nfl player and if they are slready dining at a restaurant and an nfl player comes in after , the cheerleaders are required to leave . izn't this pathetic ?"
1193,54,agent_2,"yeah , that's pretty crazy . the average lifetime earnings of an egineer is higher than the averae lifcetime earnings of an nfl player and an average mlb player ."
1194,54,agent_1,now that's supising . i wonder how much would that be
1195,54,agent_2,i'm no sure . i think it's because nbfl players do noy play ast their 30s normally
1196,54,agent_1,true . how ab0out golf ? are you amiliar with it ?
1197,54,agent_2,"not really . i've played but i'mt errible at it . hte ave5age american golf course consmes around 312 , 000 gallons of water per day ."
1198,54,agent_1,"looks intruguing . ther is a golf course in dubai thaf requires 4 , 000 , 000 gallojns of water a day ! . i would love to see that"
1199,54,agent_2,"wow , me too . smauel l . jackson puts a golf clausr in his film contracts that allows him to play golf twice a week during production ."
1200,54,agent_1,"now , that'se smart"

1208,55,agent_2,"only 11 minutes ! i want a refund for my tickets sir , that seems like a scam , pay so much for only 11 minutes"
1209,55,agent_1,"yeah , it is a crazy short amount of time . most of it is standing around znd waqtching them call plays ."
1210,55,agent_2,"i still like the game , pro playes make a lot of money for only 11 minutes of gameplaym"
1211,55,agent_1,"they sure do ,b jt they also take a big beating on their bodies . that is for sure ."
1212,55,agent_2,"they edn up with injuries and brain damage that is a sad thing ,"
1213,55,agent_1,"yeah ,t hwy might be better off playing golf ."
1214,55,agent_2,"i agree or maybe bowlin g, i hear pro bowlerse arned twice as much top footbal lstars made back int he 60s"
1215,55,agent_1,"back n the 60s is the key point there . i could see that , but not today ."
1216,55,agent_2,"it was a popular sport back then as wekl , must be fun to visit the locker oom of the university of iowa"
1217,55,agent_1,"yeah , i heard they paitned it pink ."
1218,55,agent_2,"yeah its painted pin k, well for the visitor team at least , 8 wodner if that ctually works ?"
1219,55,agent_1,"i wonder if that is done to embar4ass them ? i don't think it would wsork , it would probably just make them mad ."
1220,55,agent_2,"i know right , i would feel mad about it like a disreaspectful thing , did you ever hear about benjarvus green llis ?"
1221,55,agent_1,"no , who is that ? is he a alyer with the nfl ?"
1222,55,agent_2,"he is a player for the patriots , well former player , he wa sa rb"
1223,55,agent_1,"itneresting , was he any good att he posi6ion , or no ?"

1228,56,agent_1,i enjoy a few . did you know that baber uht was america's most famous bolfer at one point ?
1229,56,agent_2,ib et it didn hurt that he was a great baseball player . he could any ball a nile .
1230,56,agent_1,"i didn'tr ealize he was so multitalente . did you know that on average american golf courses conasume 312 , 000 gallons of water per day ? !"
1231,56,agent_2,tuat is an insane amount of wate rfor just a bunch of grass . i wonder how much that costs actally .
1232,56,agent_1,"i agree it's a huge waste . one in dubai usea 4 , 000 l 000 per day !"
1233,56,agent_2,"rich people have their prioriyties . i could never afford to play golf , i think ."
1234,56,agent_1,it is expensive . i feel like that water could be put to so much better use especially in a place like dubai that has an aid vclimate .
1235,56,agent_2,i guess the oil makees them rich and money changes peoples perfeption of relaity . in the future they m9ght regret the waste .
1236,56,agent_1,good point and i'm sure they will . also interestingly . in america glf courses make up more lan dspace that rhode island and delaware combined .
1237,56,agent_2,i wonder how amny people in the us actually play golf . 8ts a goodx sport for bisiness but i think the cost must be proh8ibitive .
1238,56,agent_1,witgh the price of edquipment and fees it is very expensive . do you enjoy football ?
1239,56,agent_2,i do like to watch football . only get the chance from time to time . you ?
1240,56,agent_1,i do . did you know that the nfl has no written rules against female players ?
1241,56,agent_2,"i heard something about that , gut then again i ront think they dever ijagined a woman showing up to try out ."
1242,56,agent_1,"possibly . an engineer makes more in a lifetime than a football alyer . knowing that , which career would you choose ?"
1243,56,agent_2,"well , i aj opposed to concussions and injuries , so would probably go with enhgineer ."
1244,56,agent_1,i agree . it would be so muc easier on your body .
1245,56,agent_2,"or i could just be a supermodle . not many doncussiohns eith3r . anyway , nice cgat !"
1246,56,agent_1,that is truie . it definitely pays well also . nive talking to you aw well .
1247,57,agent_1,"hi , how are you ? do you like sports ?"
1248,57,agent_2,"hi ! i do love ports , particularly football and golf ! although with fotball , i wish the games werel onger as tehre'sr eally on 11 minutes of live nfl gameplay on average each game . wyat abou tyou ?"
1249,57,agent_1,i aatch football toward the end ioc th eseason . i try to cagvh the super bowl . i didnt see it t5his year thouhg .
1250,57,agent_2,"yewah the supe rbowl is always a great game ! i also wish the seasons were longer as well as the regular season is only 17 quick weeks long from the beginning of september all the way to late december . it truly does fly by , sadly !"
1251,57,agent_1,"yeah , but each game is probably pretty tough on the body . i figure that it is pretty hard to get throuhg the season without an injury ."
1252,57,agent_2,that is a good point . i wonder if those tracking chips tey are sticking in the players' shoulder pads to record their every move can hopefully be usedt o study how to prevent injures ?
1253,57,agent_1,"yeah , that is what i hope . the concussion or cte proble is serious , and probably starts long before the pros ."
1254,57,agent_2,"agreed and that is so true q i've always wondered why no female players have ben signed by any teams since they can actually play as long as they meet the eligibility requirements , bt seeinga s how dangerous iy is , i don't blame the women really !"
1255,57,agent_1,"yea h,t he physical tools needed for the game are rare . i dont think women get that big .m aybe a kicker ?"
1256,57,agent_2,"maybe so ! but then again , if they're doing it simply for the money , they'd be better off entering the engineering field since engineers make mor ethan the average oifetime earnings of both mlb and nfl players anyway !"
1257,57,agent_1,"true . we need more people in ste m, especially women . fewer concussions in engneering too .?"
1258,57,agent_2,"you are so right about that ! on a similar not3e , did you know the top bowlers made double what the top football players nade bacj in teh 1960s ? that is just wrong consideringv how roug hfootball is compared to how easy bowling is ."
1259,57,agent_1,i think the nfl wag etting going and maybe there wasnt a players union ye t.t he bowlers qwere quite lucky
1260,57,agent_2,indeed they were . i just think of talented players like benjarvus greenrellis who's never fumbeld the football in his entire pro caree rand hokw he would have been ripped off if he played during thate ra !
1261,57,agent_1,"yeah , the game generates so much cash . peopl ethink the players ge too much l, but the career is short ."
1262,57,agent_2,good point ! but the game has come so far5 since then . i love the innovative yellow first down line that espn created and won an emmy for . i couldn't watch a game without it now !
1263,57,agent_1,the superimposed graphics make a big difgference to the viewing experience .
1264,57,agent_2,"idneed it does ! since w'ere on the subject of sports , do you also like golf ? i think it's xcrazy babe ruth of all people was once the most famous golfer in the us ;. he was likw the jack of all athletic trades . h a!"
1265,57,agent_1,"he could smacm a ball a country mile ! anyway ,g reaty chat !"
1266,57,agent_2,"ha ! but what i find crazier than that is the courses in america all mak eup more land space than the states ofd elawaere adn rhode island combined . that is unbelievable ! well it was great chatting wih ou as wdll ! hope you have a wonderful day , friend !"
1267,57,agent_1,"yeah , we devote a lot of land to recreation .h ave a good day !"
1268,57,agent_2,"inceed wd do ! so much so , the average course consumes roughly 312k gallons of water each day . i hope you have a gopd day as well ! take care , frjend !"
1269,58,agent_1,"are you a big go, ffan ?"
1270,58,agent_2,"i liked to play eith my dad when i was younger , but don't keep much up wit it now . i like football and other sports more . how about you ?"
1271,58,agent_1,"i played more when i was younger and had more free time . i'm a bigger football fan . did yiu know taht the university of iowa had their visitors ,ocker room painted pink ? must hage been to mess with opponents minds . lol"
1272,58,agent_2,"yeah , but seems a little sexist , frankly . ir's a pretty eexist industry of a whole , despitet echnically allowinmg women to play ."
1273,58,agent_1,true . ia gree . did you know that in the 190's top bowelrs made twice as much as tbe top football stars of gthe dqy ? i bet that number is revrrsed now .
1274,58,agent_2,"haha , i b3t the division is way more than twic ethe amoumnt now , too . it's muchb etter t0 be an engineer , these days , though ."
1275,58,agent_1,i agree on the enhgineer part . probably because they have longer careers l did you know that espn won an emmy for the superimposed yellow first down line o tv ?
1276,58,agent_2,"yeah , that line make sw2atcuhing the game on tv much easier ."
1277,58,agent_1,i agree . out of the 32 nfl teams do you have a favorite ? i'm a steelersd fan .
1278,58,agent_2,"i'm a cowboys fan , myself , even though we'll neve ramks it to the super bowl again , it sdems ."
1279,58,agent_1,they will get the3re again . that's a big stadium they have and a huge scoreboard !
1280,58,agent_2,"haha , well if that's what it takes to make it to the super bowl , cowboys have i tin the bag ! we still miss old schoo lromo , i htink . he was good in the beginning ."
1281,58,agent_1,yes . he got beat up there the last few years . i think if it wasn't for thzat thing swould have turned out better . i was just reading that there are only 11 minutes of actula live gameplay in an average nfl game . i kind of was lqways curious of hoq much they actually played .
1282,58,agent_2,"yeah , and they put all these tracking chips in everything !"
1283,58,agent_1,kidn of scary when you think about it . i often wonder what household products they put these chips in . i know someone who works for a lighting company and they said their company has developed chips that are in oights taht can record audio and video and you wouldn't even know the chips weret here . . . plus te3hy cost virtually nothing to make .
1284,58,agent_2,"i'm not surprised ,e verythign is connec5ed to an app you can talk to so of course things are constantly listening . even small chips ave to communicate to each other somehow ."
1285,58,agent_1,scary . makes yo7 wonder ir the chips in the foobtalls could be programmed to be attracted t the chips in te shoulder pads of the wide receivers .
1286,58,agent_2,"mayeb its' anothr deflategate all over again ! htey could be in the footballs , and able to change the pressure !"
1287,58,agent_1,"interestkng point to ponder over . hmmm . . . i was looking at some golf course thingsa nd rhe acerage ajerican course uses 312 , 000 gallons of water per day ! holy sm0kes !"
1288,58,agent_2,"yeah , it's incredibly wasteful . there's one in dubai that uses four million . anyway , it's been fun talking to you about sports !"
1289,58,agent_1,i enjoye dit ! have ag ood day !
1290,59,agent_1,do youw atch foobtall ?
1291,59,agent_2,"how yes i watch footvall from time to time , i saw the supe rbowl this year , what baout you"
1292,59,agent_1,"i did , it was pretty boring this year though ."
1293,59,agent_2,"free wit hyou , they should have had snoop dogg make a theme sng for the game like he did for his son's high school football team lol"
1294,59,agent_1,"interesting , eo you play golf ?"
1295,59,agent_2,"i have tried to play golf but i'm not ery good , it just takews so long to xo all 18 holes i thinm"
1296,59,agent_1,"i suck at it , but we drink beer and smoke cigars on the course ."
1297,59,agent_2,"well that's cool . ih ave palyedh alf rounds of golf and i think that nine holes is the perfect amount , i also nevger knew that the actual hole for golf is only 4 and 1 or 4 inches in diameter"
1298,59,agent_1,"that is a fact i didn't know . i can't believe a golf coursd consume 312 , 000 gallons of water a day ."
1299,59,agent_2,"yeah that is a lot ! speaking of a lot , did you know that the usa has more golf courses than the rest of the wolrd put together"
1300,59,agent_1,"i can believe that , it is a big sport over here .l not so much everywhwre else ."
1301,59,agent_2,"they do have courses worldwide though , for instance in australia in the water hazards they put bull sharks inside lol"
1302,59,agent_1,"taht is pretty col actually , wha tcourse is that ?"
1303,59,agent_2,the name but i do know it's in australia . i think it's kind of a waste taht united states military actuallyr uns over 200 golf courses around the world
1304,59,agent_1,"eh , i think th3 military people don't have such a good time . i'm all for letting them have some spoils . it's a rough life , i have a few frneds that do it . always moving places ."
1305,59,agent_2,"well i would have to see these c0ourses , it does cost taxpayes 140 a year which i think is a lot , it's interestig though to that antarctica has disc golf courses"
1306,59,agent_1,"wow , that's not too bad in the grands cheme of things . they do have to have som4 leisure time . i've never been to antarctica , have yoi ?"
1307,59,agent_2,no but i do play disc goof so maybe i will make it ovr there one day lol its funny tjat kimj ong ill is said to have scored 11 hole in ones in one day
1308,59,agent_1,"wait , what is disc golf ? i've never heard of this ?"
1309,59,agent_2,"disc golf involves throwing a frisbee into these cahin like goals , its actuqally really fun !"
1310,59,agent_1,"oh , interesting . . i've never heard of this , will have to check it out . nice chattng with yoy ."
1311,60,agent_1,"hi , o you prefer golf or football ? odd , babe ruth was once maerica's most famous golfer . you dont' zee golf mixed with o5her sports bery often ."
1312,60,agent_2,"i like both ! did you know that the average american golf course consumes around 312 , 000 gallons of water per day ?"
1313,60,agent_1,"that crazy to me , if there's any credence to climate change that's al ot of wasted water . plus land , more area in the u sin golf courses than rhode island an dfelaware combinrd ."
1314,60,agent_2,that's a lot of land ! there is a golf course in dubai that needs 4 million gallons of water per day .
1315,60,agent_1,"my poihnt on wzsted water , especially if climate change drives more heat in the atmosphere . crwzy . odd how sports have cjanged , you see where the tolp bowler , i assume dick weber being that old , made twice as much as the top foobtall stars ? times have changed ."
1316,60,agent_2,yes they sure have . did yoj hear about what the universigty of iowa did to their visitors locker room ?
1317,60,agent_1,"i hate to admit it , but i got a wr9ting degree att eh university 9f iow3a , i didn't know about that then . i wonder if that was to pysche thme out , kr distract tehm duing game preparatikn ? i'm ot aware of many big1 0 championships there so it must not have been totally successful . i see that theres' no rule against women playing in the nfl , dxo you think there will ever be a female place kicker ? i'ce seen some amqzing female soccer players ."
1318,60,agent_2,"i think, we will see one at some point . what do you think oc the superkmposed yellow firzt down line that espn created an dwon a nemmy fof ? it sure changed the way we watch hte game on tv ."
1319,60,agent_1,"i thought emmy's were awards for pople , ij hope it was to the guy at espn qwho invented jit wnd yes does give you visualization at first down yardrages . did you see where the average engineer makes more in his lifetime that the average nfl qnd m.b player ? there must be a lot kf injury hsortened adn shorty careers to bring the big money playe4s contracts ."
1320,60,agent_2,my guess would be because the engineer ha sa longer career . do you know what the highest scoring football game ever was ?
1321,60,agent_1,"that 2220 georgia tech over cumbwrland , a sxhame they didn't ave a 10 run rule like little league badeball on that on e."
1322,60,agent_2,that's what i call a blowout !
1323,60,agent_1,hahha and thne some . did you know theee's only 11 minhutes of livw play in thw nfl game . i gues stha tgood when you think about uinjueies andt he wear and tear on the players bodie zsand more comercial time to boot !
1324,60,agent_2,seems like a short amount of time and yet th4y stretch it out to 3 hours . lol what do you think of the tracking chips that hte nfl is putting in the playes shoulder pads and footballs tlo trac kata ?
1325,60,agent_1,"i xon't understand why they'd n4ed them on the player s, on the ball it seems like they'd be able to trakc out of bounds , pass the goal line and first downs with that chip . they could either check on the referee's performance or eventually make that the decidin ball placement . i see a lot of use in the trawcking chip in the ball ."
1326,60,agent_2,i agree . here's an interesting stat : former patriots rb benjarvus greenellis never fumbled the ball in his nfl career . impressive !
1327,60,agent_1,"yes , i moved to the boston area 4 years ago so i'm in the heart pf patrioy football and they talk about a lot of football facts year round , but i'd nrver heard that and that is impressives , aseuming he had a normal amount of carries , . i knew about canadian football , rugby anc austrian ruled , had you ever heard about gaelic football ? i'm not familiar ."
1328,60,agent_2,i can't say that i'm fmailiar wit hgaelic football . i've neve3r heard of it .
1329,60,agent_1,"that makes two of us , how about those saint s. the don't allow their cheerleaders to dine in th same restaurant as the players qnd if a palyer comes in the establishument while the cheerleader is eating , she has tpo immediately leave . that seems s4exist at least and jaybe i,legal or discriminatory ."
1330,60,agent_2,that seems like the oddest rule . it?s been fun chatting with you !
1331,60,agent_1,"yes i dnjoyed , thank you and have a pleasant evening ."
1332,60,agent_2,you also have a pleasant evening !
1333,61,agent_1,hey you a golf fna ? i'm not a hugef an just cause it is considered more of a countryclub sport .
1334,61,agent_2,no . i find it kind of boring . i know tiger woods is rewally good gdss .
1335,61,agent_1,yeah he is definite;y one of the best . it is popuar though . golf courses take up more land space 5han rhode island and delaware combined !
1336,61,agent_2,tiger vs phil mickelson was on thanksgiving weekend .
1337,61,agent_1,oh i defibitel didn't watch that ! everyone knows babe ruth though and he was once americas' most popular golfer !
1338,61,agent_2,wow . didn't kno2 taht . antarctica has a disc golf course
1339,61,agent_1,oh that would be a cold course ! a golf course in dubai requires 4 million gallons of water !
1340,61,agent_2,that is a lot of water . the us have more golf courses than the worldc ombiend
1341,61,agent_1,i bet . did you know samuel l . jackson llves golf ? he plays tqice a week .
1342,61,agent_2,never would have thought that . there are bull xharks in one of the water hazards in australia golf course
1343,61,agent_1,whoa scary . it is interesting that it doesn't utlize a standard playing area .
1344,61,agent_2,18 holes a games . seems like a long day .
1345,61,agent_1,yeah it does . i lik efootball ab i tmore . i love the nfl beczause they have 32 teams so people are bound to find one they like .
1346,61,agent_2,yes football is way better . tyat i strue but you usually only hear about a select few .
1347,61,agent_1,yes the top ones .w onder if there will ever be a woman player because there is no rule against it !
1348,61,agent_2,msye as a kcker . did you know they put tracking chips in hte footblal
1349,61,agent_1,oh interesting what is that for ? thdy also don't nake as muc hmoney as people think .
1350,61,agent_2,to track statistics i gues . yeah i heard engineers makem ore in their life time
1351,61,agent_1,yes they do ! an average nfl gae only has sctally 11 minutes of gameplay .
1352,61,agent_2,matt atricia is a coacuh but also a rocket scirntist !
1353,61,agent_1,what a smart man . wow . the cheerleaders i new orleans cannot eat with the playersunfair for them !
1354,62,agent_1,"hi there , do you nejoy watchign football ?"
1355,62,agent_2,i do enjoy football . professional but not college so mych .
1356,62,agent_1,"i htink college games are fun to attend if you're actually in college and cna do the associated partying , but yes , i agree that pro games are more enjoyable to watch . there'st hat 17 week regular season , pluw the addition of the the playoffs ."
1357,62,agent_2,ye sand with preseason and the superbowl it gets long . did you know that snoop dogg wrote aq fight song for his son's high school football team ?
1358,62,agent_1,"that's interestingi gues it wasn't a rap , i doubt the fans wouldu ave been able to stick to that flow haha . musicians want to be athletds and athete swant to be musicians , so i guess he gets the best of both worlds . tyhe secondbestj ob for athletes is commentator , though , like those of a lot of football players ."
1359,62,agent_2,i nave noticed that a lolt of players go on to be commentators . die you also know that the hiyhest paid department of defense employeres are three fooyball coaches of the service branch ?
1360,62,agent_1,"that makes sense , i guess , although i doubt they'll ever make the money that coaches of power 5 schools do or be able to trade up to the nfl . i also doubt that an6y of heir playuers go on to then fl , but the average lifetime earnings of an engineer , whivh a lot of student sat the academiess fudy , are higher than tha tof an average fl player anyway ."
1361,62,agent_2,i would certainly take the engineer caree rpath in that case . it woulc certainly be much easier on your body .
1362,62,agent_1,"yes , can you believe fthat in the 60s top pro bowlers made twice as juch asf ootballs players ? talk about a juob that's easy on you body !"
1363,62,agent_2,"thag would be much easier on your body . i can't imagine that paying more ., time have changed . were you also aware that 14 of te world's 25 largest stadiums are american college football team stadiums ?"
1364,62,agent_1,"that's crazy ! although i went to college at florida , so i'm ac6ually pretty familiarw ith huge stadium s. did you know that the highest scoring football game was a college amtchup whe ngeorgia tech beat cumberland 222 in 1916 ?"
1365,62,agent_2,wow ! how is it even possib;e to score that many points i none game ? !
1366,62,agent_1,"i'm sure it easn't a fsir fight , given how new thd game was back then . they definitely didn't have tv for watching , le alone the supsrimposed y,elow first down line created by espn that earned them an mmy ."
1367,62,agent_2,i'm so glad that invented that . did you know that the nfl has tracking chips in players shoulder pads andt eh football ?
1368,62,agent_1,it's amazing that they can use technoogy to anwlyze the game so precisely . can you imagine if thesre were chips in golf balls to measure all 0f those movement metrics ?
1369,62,agent_2,tgat would be amazing . i do wonder why they do not use these chipa when making call sinstead of rwlying just on reiews .
1370,62,agent_1,"it's still a game rooted in tradition , i guess , pkus someone could probably hack adn manipulate the datathat's w can of worms youd on't want to open ! plus the reviews take up so much of the time ; that?s part of tye experiewnce , and how people spned over 3 hours watching a game in which there are only an averagw of 11 minutes of live play ."
1371,62,agent_2,i suppose so . you mentioned gold earlier . do you enjoy golf ?
1372,62,agent_1,"i've never eve nplayed on a prope rcourse haha . i have terrible handeye coordination ,m nor the patience to b eany good . it alsos eems like a kind of waste of landgolf course in america take up mor espace than rhode island and delaware combined !"
1373,62,agent_2,htat is a waste of land . did you also know tat the u . s . has more golf courses than the rest of the world combined ?
1374,62,agent_1,"we havre a lot of excess , don't we ? the average american gold course consumes 312 , 000 ga.lons of water daily , but that's only thef raction of a course in duait hat requires more than 4 million gallons . it's pretty wasteful everywhere ."
1375,62,agent_2,that's horrible and a huge waste . so many go without drinkable water .
1376,63,agent_1,"hi , how are you ?"
1377,63,agent_2,hi im doing great how about you ?
1378,63,agent_1,"i'm good , thanks for asking . do you like foobtall ?"
1379,63,agent_2,"i like watcdhing it sometimes , i guess it depends onw ho is palying lol ho about u ?"
1380,63,agent_1,"me too , 5he games can gtet kind of lng to watch . the alsts uper bowl i watched was over threeh ours long ."
1381,63,agent_2,"thats so weird , especially since its only 11 min of g,ae play"
1382,63,agent_1,"i know , it ,akes me mad , som4etimes to think about that . a lot of wasted time standing around . lol"
1383,63,agent_2,yeah they take a lot of time outs .
1384,63,agent_1,do you have a favorite team ?
1385,63,agent_2,"i liek the 49ers , how about you ? did you know in the 60's top bowlersm ade almost twice as much as football players ?"
1386,63,agent_1,"don'th ate me , my team i sthe new 3nglahd patriots . i know a o0t of folks despise them , but that's where 8 grew up . lol i can't believe that about bowlers , who watched that ? bowling is like wathcing paint dry ."
1387,63,agent_2,"lol no worries , i don't follow footgall religiously , so i wont hate you for your team that cheats lol"
1388,63,agent_1,"lol , ey we doh ave s lot of good players . one of our former players , runningb ba kbenjarvis grene ellis never fumbled in his whole cwreer !"
1389,63,agent_2,"i did read about that , very impressive l thats gotta be a record or something . he doesnt play for the patriots anymore though ."
1390,63,agent_1,have you heard about th echips 6he nfl puts in the player's shoulder pads ?
1391,63,agent_2,"yeah i have that reaplly crazy , i had no udea , technology ise verywhere lol good idea though to trck stats ."
1392,63,agent_1,"they also have chips in the balls , too . wonder if they have a searchable database for ap lthis info ?"
1393,63,agent_2,"li,e for the pulbic ?"
1394,63,agent_1,"yeah , i think that would be interesating to look at the data for my favorite players ."
1395,63,agent_2,"oh i see . hmmm toogle i t! that would be interesting to see , or maybet he 0pponents would use it against them"
1396,63,agent_1,"ahnd vice versa , kind of like high tech spying . lol no , they probably keep that data locked up tighter han your bank account info . lolo"
1397,63,agent_2,"lol well it would be fair game , if everyone is using it against each other lol its bee ngreat talking to you , have a good one ."
1398,64,agent_1,do you like watching football ?
1399,64,agent_2,i do . i watched the lzst superbowl on tv .
1400,64,agent_1,i did too but mostly just because i wanted to go to a paty . i probably won't watch football until the next superbow ;on the first sunday of february of next yea r.
1401,64,agent_2,it is nice to be able to 5alk about it with coworkers and friendd . d9 you now htat lifetime earnings of an negineer isx higher thaj lifetime earnigns of an average nfl player l
1402,64,agent_1,"that is surprising . and in the 1960s , top bowlers made twice as much as top football stars ."
1403,64,agent_2,"i am surprised . football players , top ones , make much more mon4g tha nbowlers now ,"
1404,64,agent_1,"yeah , people do really love their football . i don't really , maybe because there ar eonly about 11 minutes of live gameplay per game ."
1405,64,agent_2,americans love nf lgames . do yolu know that it nas 32 teams divided equally between nfc and afc ?
1406,64,agent_1,"o , i did not know that . football has come a long ay . the technology is awesome . now houlder pads and balls hsve trackers ."
1407,64,agent_2,nfl uses tracking ckps o record every move by playwers .
1408,64,agent_1,"the footablls trakc rotation , velocity , ball speef wnd location . pretty neat ."
1409,64,agent_2,"it is n3at . that way , thet eams can strategize their games ."
1410,64,agent_1,9i wonder if there will ever be any women playing in the nfl . there are no explicit rules against female players .
1411,64,agent_2,"there is no rule but i do not think most women are interested in joining american football teams . this type of football us too physical , unlikes occer ?"
1412,64,agent_1,some nfl players have jusdft incredible talent . rb bejarvus greenellis hazs never fumbled the football in his nfl career
1413,64,agent_2,that is incredible . i need to read more about him .
1414,64,agent_1,do you like baseball too ?
1415,64,agent_2,"it is ather boring to me . i have never watched worl dseries , even on tv ."
1416,64,agent_1,you are no alon3e . the women's wordl cup had higher tv ratibgs thn teh world series in the us .
1417,64,agent_2,i am glad that i'm not alone . i reel bad since my bst friend is into it .
1418,64,agent_1,"baseball is actually the onlys port i like to watch , but i thas to be in person . i like the atmosphere ."
1419,65,agent_1,"how's it going , do you follo wfootball , there is a total lf 32 teams"
1420,65,agent_2,"i dont usually , im more of a aseball fan . its really interesting that womej are techniclaly allowed tlo particfipate though"
1421,65,agent_1,"yea , since there is no rule against them playing i can see a femle place kikcer in the nfl one day"
1422,65,agent_2,i bet she would kick butt too . sahme taht thd mew orleans cheerleaders cant have dinner with an ntl player though
1423,65,agent_1,ye athat rule forbidding cheerleader from the same place as football players is outdate and sexist
1424,65,agent_2,u agree . pretty funny taht u of iowa painted their visitor's locker rom pink though
1425,65,agent_1,"yea , iowa myst b trying to psych out teh visiting team with htose pink lokcer rooms lol"
1426,65,agent_2,"so i dont know much about football , but the highest game score ever being 222 to zero seesm ridicu,lous"
1427,65,agent_1,"yea , i know georgia tech is typically a good team but cumberland must have been awful"
1428,65,agent_2,"so what do you thin kabout baseball , its funny that the cubs were the first to win the series abck to back but never won again lol"
1429,65,agent_1,it's great to watch with s0me beer . it's crazy bzbe ruth was caught stealing in game 7 of teh 1926 world series
1430,65,agent_2,"hey when your edown by one run , sometimes you gotta go for it . difn6t work well for him though lol"
1431,65,agent_1,just seems like a bad ecisions 6to steal homwe since babe wasn't exactly light on nhis feet
1432,65,agent_2,very true . possibly almost as bad s the marines cafrying in the canadian flg 7psode don
1433,65,agent_1,ma6b the us mwrines corps were trying to get in hte blue jays heads
1434,65,agent_2,"ohh , clever ! can you believe the ottoman empire was still a thiny when the cubs last won ? i know weve been waiting a while but yeesh"
1435,65,agent_1,"that's pretty crazy , plu sthe cubs were the first team to win bac kto back world series too"
1436,65,agent_2,"it anazes me they ever won at akl , they always get so close but not quite there"
1437,65,agent_1,"yea , it's crazy that the al had won more wordl series thwn the nl"
1438,65,agent_2,"it is , i've never heard of it referrd to as the fall classic either"

1443,66,agent_2,yeah i couldn't watch the supefr bowl it was pretty boring .
1444,66,agent_1,im not a huge fan of footbakll . are you ab ig fan or just watch in passing
1445,66,agent_2,haven't been watching myself just the bowl . apparently rehre is no written rule that women can't pla7y .
1446,66,agent_1,i dont think there should be a ruel that woman cant play .
1447,66,agent_2,"i don't either , sure would chanfe the dynamic of the game though . weould be interesting to say the elast ."
1448,66,agent_1,i can see where it would get difficult with peoples own morals and esuch . a lot of men don't want to hit a woman and then hter eis a woman in the field they hav to hit . . . . would be interesting
1449,66,agent_2,of course . apparently they have added 5racking chip sin the pads of the players .
1450,66,agent_1,really ? why did they do that ?
1451,66,agent_2,"to track and recor dmoves , soon will be watching ddrones play the game ."
1452,66,agent_1,thats interesting . i bet i tis for like the screen replays where tuye use markers
1453,66,agent_2,maybe .d id you know that an average game 0on has 11 minutes of live gmae play .
1454,66,agent_1,"i did not know taht . what is the rest , ads ?"
1455,66,agent_2,not sure probably .
1456,66,agent_1,thats ridicul0us . did you xee the half time this year ?
1457,66,agent_2,no i did not watch it .
1458,66,agent_1,i think it wanst very good . i feel like they havd lal been blah . teh last good superbowl half time was katy perry
1459,66,agent_2,"if you say so , haha ! did you know that the university of iowa's visiting locker room is oainted pink ?"
1460,66,agent_1,i sthat for breast cancer ? or intimidation ?
1461,66,agent_2,intimidation i'm eure .
1462,66,agent_1,i think is funny taht a color can be used for that . . .
1463,66,agent_2,"in the 1960's top bowlers made more tha ntop ncfl football players , twice as much !"
1464,66,agent_1,bpowling ! i saw t5hat asnd it is a bit crazy to fhink bowlers made money like that
1465,66,agent_2,i know right ! nice talking with ykou .
1466,67,agent_1,do youe njoy football ?
1467,67,agent_2,"i love nfl , nd you ?"
1468,67,agent_1,"i lve football too . i use dto play pickup football ith my friends or with my family all the time , but not so much anymore . i love watching nfl though ! did you know there's actually no rule againjst women playing in the nfl ?"
1469,67,agent_2,if htey can blal they can play lol
1470,67,agent_1,exactly ! onlg if they can pass the rligibility requirements though . i'd love to see some women take on tom brady !
1471,67,agent_2,the university of iowa visitor locker room is already pink .
1472,67,agent_1,true ! i bet it's to make the opposing team feel emasculated . did 6ou knowt hat new orleans cheerleadeers can't eat in the same restaujrant as nay nf lplayer ? even if they're already there first . they would ahvd to leave !
1473,67,agent_2,what if the nfl player was female then ?
1474,67,agent_1,that's so true . i wonder . . . the ule soubds pretty misogynistic anyway . i wonder if there can be a male cheerleader .
1475,67,agent_2,did you know espn invented the yellow line ?
1476,67,agent_1,"i difn't , but that makes sense . i think they got an emmy for it ! arn't teh emmy's gor tv shows ? that's so weird ."
1477,67,agent_2,to them it is still q show i guess . in 1916 georgia tech won 22 to zero
1478,67,agent_1,"what ? ! taht's crazy . and sijce an avedage game is only 11 minutes in actual live gtameplay , that's especially insane !"
1479,67,agent_2,"if i were cumberland , th3e losing team , i would haveg iven up by the first quarter !"
1480,67,agent_1,exactly ! imagine being onm that team and reapizing you're going down in historya s the biggest sefeat ever !
1481,67,agent_2,"in the 60 ; s , pro bowlers made mor ethzn football players"
1482,67,agent_1,"wow , that's odd . today , eguneer make more than the average nfl player over their lifetime . maybe i should invest in some more education !"
1483,67,agent_2,i have heard that . i think it is a little misleading because the average nfl career is only 34 years and they still have time to find a career at 24 or 25 years old lol .
1484,67,agent_1,"that's a fair point . do you like teh patriots ? i'm a big giants fa nso i don't like the patriots vry much . did you mnow that i one of the past super bowls between the giants amd the patriots , the gizants accidentally scored a touchdonw an dwon the game when they were trying to not score a touchdown ?"
1485,67,agent_2,i hate the patriots . that isa mazing abou8t the giantw . beatt hem alleged cheaters evrry tim e the are the lannisters of the nfl .
1486,67,agent_1,"yeah i heard ghat the author of gae of thron4s called tyem that . i hate bill belichick , although he is the ' winningest ' coach in nfl postseason ."
1487,67,agent_2,yeah i know . enouhg is enough . . . i hope he goes back to the browns haha . take care
1488,67,agent_1,"yes , back to the browns where he belongs !"
1489,68,agent_1,hllo
1490,68,agent_2,hi . the nfl seems to be at the end of its days .
1491,68,agent_1,"that's what people seem to be saying everywherd , but i don't know . they have gotten through scandals and issues before . i'm not counting them out yet ."
1492,68,agent_2,what about hte problems witht he ncaa though ? the nfl needs teh player .
1493,68,agent_1,"i get that and it is valid , but it's like any sport . if 1 person quits , there are 5 waiting to take their place . if players don'tw ant t play , then they should move along ."
1494,68,agent_2,what about the fans 6hough . people might ge tbored of a game when the quality goes down .
1495,68,agent_1,"that is true . everything runs in cycles though . i liken it to a losing team having an empty stadjum and a winning team selling out . fgans are fickle . their . . . our views are important , but we come and go ."
1496,68,agent_2,"i wonder whether lett9n women ino the game would create interest , get more fans ."
1497,68,agent_1,"oh , it absolutely would . it would nbe like . . . and i know i amg oing to butcher then ame here , but when manon reheaume played in the nhl . my only concern is that if mishandled it might come off like a gimmick ."
1498,68,agent_2,"i see your point . long term , will women stay ? true ."
1499,68,agent_1,"i feel liek . . . there ars ehnough talented women athletes out there , that a woman kickefr or qb is possiblpe , peraps a wide receiver ."
1500,68,agent_2,women can be to8gh too . would a coach like billb elichick hire a woman if shec oyd help him win the super bowl ?
1501,68,agent_1,"this is going to come off sounding bad , but itr isn't meant to . i thinka nyone in the front office would l,ook at it from the perspectivs of generating revenue and views . thes ponsors would love the coverage ."
1502,68,agent_2,"belichick ha sdone we,l in the post season , so i think he's looking at it from a strategic point of view . the sponsors would tie her presence into a bunch ot social issues and products ."
1503,68,agent_1,"oh absolutely . belichek is looking at it from the right angle ftoo . he wants t win , that's what he is paid for . i think the guy wou.d hire a green martina if he thought it would guarantee an extra td ."
1504,68,agent_2,tom brady ad belichick have done well together . i wonder how rady would react to a woman in the huddle .
1505,68,agent_1,"what a combo those two are . while i'm hot a huge fan of brady , i dot hink that he is enough of a professional to be able to sdapt if a scenario like that ever actually took place ."
1506,68,agent_2,"i wonder whether the male players would get ejalous of the coverage she gets . if there is revenue sharing , tehy miht not care because they make more"
1507,68,agent_1,"i thin, they almost certainly will . it happened i nanscar when danica patrick joibed . thne after they get used to it , it will gradualoy get to be a normal thing . they will adapt to it ."
1508,68,agent_2,"wow , she is awesome . the violenmce of the nfl is a bit different though . i wonde if the male players might be hesitant to smash her hasrd ."
1509,68,agent_1,thje is true . that is one thing theyw ill certainly have to adjust to .
1510,69,agent_1,"hello , do you watch football ?"
1511,69,agent_2,are you a new englac patriots fan ?
1512,69,agent_1,lol no i am not . did you know there is no writte ntrule against female players ? women are allowed to play football .
1513,69,agent_2,"and sorry , yes i watch gootball . i am not a fan of the patriots either ! lll i did know about the rule allowing female players . i'm surpriaed no females play tho"
1514,69,agent_1,george rr martin calls th epatriots the lannisters o ffootall lol
1515,69,agent_2,haha that is hilarious ! i agree with george rr martin ! did you knowt hat the highest scorign game inf ootball was 2220 ? that blows my mind !
1516,69,agent_1,"yeah thats pretty crazy , that is a devasting loss ."
1517,69,agent_2,8it certainly is ! i xan't imagine being the losing team . i casn' tfathom any team scoring 222 points tho either !
1518,69,agent_1,i onow right . i hope they use that game as a training to never suffer tyhat embarr5assing moment agakn lol
1519,69,agent_2,haha i hope so too ! i'm surprised tha tespn won an emy for creating the yellow lne representing the first donw . i had no clue !
1520,69,agent_1,taht is cool . i also didnt know that the nfl uses tracking chips on the players
1521,69,agent_2,"oh wow , i didn't know thaf either . it certainly seems like a lot of science and tech are involved in the game ."
1522,69,agent_1,"yeah tehnoogy has contributed a lot to it , now they have all that fanvy stuff on the tv for people at home . they can draw om the screen and light up certain parts . i heard there was once a coach that was w physics teacher ."
1523,69,agent_2,"that's really interesting . nad yea , they can certain;y do all kinds of things for the viewers at home to see . i've heard tha tnfl engineers make more in their lifetiem than the nfl players . yhat's hard to believe given how much the players gets paid !"
1524,69,agent_1,"i know right . 5ridonkulous amoutn of monwy ! id rather be the engineer , less injuries lol in the 60s bowlers used to make more htan nfl football players lol"
1525,69,agent_2,"haha yea i rather be the engineet too ! and wow , bowlers ? !n o way ! haha"
1526,69,agent_1,i guess football wasnt very popular back then lol
1527,69,agent_2,"i guess . i know m grandparents were very serious bowlers haha ghey only brought home trophids , not cash tho q1"
1528,69,agent_1,"same here , my grandparetns are ig in5o bowling , a lot oft rophies ,m y dad iks in a league but its just for fun"
1529,69,agent_2,that's cool . i always thouhgt it was fum to go bowling .
1530,69,agent_1,"lol well its been good chatting , have a good one ."
1531,70,agent_1,do you watch footabll ?
1532,70,agent_2,"sometimes , but there is not much action in a game , only 11 minute , don't you think ?"
1533,70,agent_1,yeah that doesn't seem like a long time i think much of the time is taken by ads that makes me angry .
1534,70,agent_2,do youl ike ths other kinds of football ? like soccer or rugby ?
1535,70,agent_1,"soccer is my favorite , i also loke rugby , what about you ?"
1536,70,agent_2,"neither one , the6 are not televised whete i live . i have played soccer when i was young . it was fun . do you watch socer or play it ?"
1537,70,agent_1,"i lije to watch it and play it , is football telivised , do you have a favorjte team ?"
1538,70,agent_2,"yeah , i like teh new england patriots , tbe are the nearest t3am from hqere i live . ther eare great even if most people don'f like them ."
1539,70,agent_1,"they ar3 my favorite team so im not one of them lol , the author of game of thrones reffer to them as the lanisters of the nfl , thats funny"
1540,70,agent_2,"i don't follow games of thrones , is it a go9d thing or a bad thing ?"
1541,70,agent_1,"its a bad thing , well its the mosft powerful family on the show but they are cruel ,"
1542,70,agent_2,"that is kind of fittin gfor them , they are really a football dynasty ."
1543,70,agent_1,"they are , they are the team with the most superbowls won but they also share the record for superbowl losses"
1544,70,agent_2,how do you think thet will honor bill belichick when he retires ? he is a legendary coach .
1545,70,agent_1,"he i s, he is the winningest coach of a postseason , i bet he is in the hall of fame , i hope he stays in thet eam for a while more ."
1546,70,agent_2,"htey can't retire his number , they won't name a new stadium in honor , i guess coaches are made to be forgotten ."
1547,70,agent_1,"that seemse kind 0f sad , they ar ethe head of the tedam after all , a ean can be good but i fthey have a bad coach they will paly terrilby ."
1548,70,agent_2,"but t5here is one thing that bothers me with the patriots , ita s the naem of their stadium , gillette stadium , it is kin dof tacky ."
1549,70,agent_1,"the stadiu msholuld have a bdtter nae i sagree , it must be really expensiv ethough ,"
1550,70,agent_2,"yeah gillette must pay a lot to be associated with the patrots . yet most of the money don't go to the play4rs , an engineer wil learn more in his life time than he average nfl player ."
1551,70,agent_1,"well thst might be hecause an engineer works twie as much y3ars as a foobtall player , but its w surising stat sinxe football players earn tons of cash"
1552,71,agent_1,"how's it going , do you follow football ? depending on the countr ut cojld refer to rugby or soccer"
1553,71,agent_2,love nfl football !
1554,71,agent_1,"me too , glad espn invented the yellow first down line for games , mkakes watchin giyt so muchb etter"
1555,71,agent_2,espn wone mmy for that
1556,71,agent_1,"yea , tat's pretty cool . kinda funny that a 3 hour football game only has an average of 11 minutes of gameplay"
1557,71,agent_2,i did not know that 14 of the 25 largest stadium belong to college football
1558,71,agent_1,"8 woncer if the university iowa stadium is on that list , funny enough teh painted the vfisitors locker room pink"
1559,71,agent_2,not that pink i for females only but there is no rule qgainst a femlae playing
1560,71,agent_1,since theres no rule sagainst female players i wonder if there will b ea female placekicker in the nfl son
1561,71,agent_2,i think we would need to sed one in collwge or caandizn first .
1562,71,agent_1,"i think there was already one in college called cumberlan d, they lost to georgia tech 222o"
1563,71,agent_2,"wow , lucky for the patriots that happneed a long time ago ."
1564,71,agent_1,i'm not a big patriot fan . they are the lannisters of the nfl
1565,71,agent_2,"i think they cheated the raiders with the tuck r7le , they undefinf,atewdb awlls , and they recorded ohers practicez . who knows what else ?"
1566,71,agent_1,beliuchick is considered the coach with the mostr post season win in hitory
1567,71,agent_2,i did not know belichick coached the browns .
1568,71,agent_1,yea and belichic keven won a pokstseason gaem witg the browns
1569,71,agent_2,his only other playoff win with another eam .
1570,71,agent_1,it's crazy that the bills and pa6riots have each lost 4 super bowls
1571,71,agent_2,all of their wins and losses were by 3 or 4 points too
1572,71,agent_1,"well i got to go , nice chatting with you"
1573,72,agent_1,"hello , what's your favorite football team ?"
1574,72,agent_2,hey ! i have slways like tuhe dallas cowboys !
1575,72,agent_1,"did you know that the highest score ever in a football game happened in 1916 , when georgia tec defeated cumberland 2220"
1576,72,agent_2,holy cow that's a high score ! ! ! 5they must have been scorintg evertime they touchsd the ball !
1577,72,agent_1,"haha probably , i bet cumberland university will never forget that game"
1578,72,agent_2,i bet no6 . i know i wouldn't if i played for them . i heard the average lifetime earnings fof an nfl player is lower than that of an engineer
1579,72,agent_1,"reallt , that's interwsting ., in addition to that , top bowlers made twice as mucha s top football stars in the 60's ."
1580,72,agent_2,"football is a fun sport , butw ith the relatiely low pay nad the injury rate , it makes me wonder why people would want to do0 it ."
1581,72,agent_1,"yeah i'm not sure , did you know that the locker room f9r visiting football teams is completely pink at the university of iowa ."
1582,72,agent_2,hahaha ! now that i hilarious ! what an awesome thing to do ! lol;
1583,72,agent_1,"ahaha it is funny , i will definitely look it up ."
1584,72,agent_2,bill belichick is the winningest nfl postseason coach . no wonder with the patriots !
1585,72,agent_1,yeah he had 20 wins with the patriots . the author of game sof thrones calledt he new engalnd patriots the nfl's lannisters .
1586,72,agent_2,"eww , inceszt gal0re !"
1587,72,agent_1,excus eme ?
1588,72,agent_2,"hte lannister referenc e. . . it's from game of thrones , andt hat family wa sincestual to keep the blood line ' pure '"
1589,72,agent_1,"oh ok , i'ms orry i didn't understand . the new orleans saints cheerleaders cant' eat in the same estauratb as fl players ."
1590,72,agent_2,"well that's crazy ! i'd say it was sexist , bu tthere iswn't any rule in the nfl that females cant' play ."
1591,72,agent_1,"yeah thag's right , well it's been nice talking with you ."
1592,72,agent_2,you too !
1593,72,agent_1,bye
1594,73,agent_1,"hi , how are you today ? do you follow football ?"
1595,73,agent_2,"i'm good , thanks for asking . yes , i watch a little football . how about you ?"
1596,73,agent_1,"i try to watch playoffs , maybe the super bowl . did you know that zn average nfl game only has 11 minutes of live gameplay ?"
1597,73,agent_2,"omg , i could swear that last superbowl i watched las6ed three uhours . so much wasted time !"
1598,73,agent_1,"yah , that halftime shkw really stinks up the joitn too . the nfl has no written rule against female players ; womejn would n fact be allowed if they met the elagu'ew eligibility rwquiremnets . can you imagine a woman un the super bowl ?"
1599,73,agent_2,"that woudl liven things up , maybe igt wouldn't seem so long , then ? i would watch those linebackers !"
1600,73,agent_1,maybe that should be a punishmenr for someone . they have to ply in the nfl against a linebacker .
1601,73,agent_2,"that's a vood idea , i think it would be a good deterrent . what do you think te nfl does with all the data they collect from tbhose chips in the players shoulder pads ?"
1602,73,agent_1,they probably use ti for strategy . aybe to help predict injuries or something . player safety is important .
1603,73,agent_2,"that's true , tehy have to know when tjey have a concussion . i wonder if the chip in the football detected when the new england patriots deflated it in deflategate ?"
1604,73,agent_1,"that would be funny . it hsould detect something , the flight of the ball , its woblbe , something ."
1605,73,agent_2,"lol . i heart he new orleans saint scheerleaders have it pretty rough . they have q rule for they can?t eat at the same restaurant as any nfl player and if a player does walk in and fthey are eating their meal , they have to get up and leave ."
1606,73,agent_1,the cheerleaders re paid badly and they have to put up withnt hat crap . maybe the tracking chips w0ould help avoid that situation .
1607,73,agent_2,"hey , egerything gets tracked , nowaday s. man , t seems like i've had nothimg on my brain the last few weeks butf ootball . how about you ?"
1608,73,agent_1,i haven't thought much about sports recetnly . too busy . plus ne won again . there's somethign fishy going on there .
1609,73,agent_2,"you think ? lol they have the goat tom brady , you just knew he was going to save thme once again !"
1610,73,agent_1,the guy is so clutch . i don'g know how he does its o consistently . i figure bill must understand football better than any other coach .
1611,73,agent_2,"belichick is a goat too ,f or surer . winningest coach in nfl postseason football . what a matchup ,t he stars aligned for that association ."

1635,74,agent_2,it must have been . i am sure tv was not ws big of a deal as it is now . espn won an emy fpr creating th esuperimposed first down line . amazing q

1640,75,agent_2,"hi there , i think it would be great for the league and for girl sin general . how baout yu ?"
1641,75,agent_1,"i think it woudl b3 awesome , if they did something about a certain team's archaic rule . . . of not permittint cheerldaders in the same restaurant as the players ."
1642,75,agent_2,"i think i have heard about that rule , it soudns so dumb . i think it is timw to have that rule removed to be honest ."
1643,75,agent_1,"i do too . the saints should do better , if not for themselves , but for the giod of tne league ."
1644,75,agent_2,yeah ia gre ewith you on that . do you know wjhat the average actual tim eof gmaeplay is for an average nfl game ?
1645,75,agent_1,"somethingl ike 10 minutes , right ? i think i heard that when they were talking about the chips in the shoulder pads of the players ."
1646,75,agent_2,"ueah it's only 11 minutes of actual gameplay , the rest is spent calling plays and movinbg chains and stuff . yeah k have heard about that too , very interesting ."
1647,75,agent_1,"that is so bizarre , and the time dodsn't add up , not if thre is 15 minutes per quarter . or is that only highschool ?"
1648,75,agent_2,"no thats the real time , the clkck runs while all that stuff is going on , so the actual time they are playing is short ."
1649,75,agent_1,really ? i never knew that . sawme with the traking chips in the balls .
1650,75,agent_2,i hope they use spme of that tracking technology to help improve player safety .
1651,75,agent_1,i would hope so too . i still cannot believe espn won ane mmy for that superimposed yellow line .
1652,75,agent_2,"taht is pretty wild tha tthey did , but itd oes hell a lot fr making the games more exciting on third down !"
1653,75,agent_1,"are you a game of thrones fan ? my son is , nzd thinks it's hilarious that the author likenedt he patriots to the lannisters ."
1654,75,agent_2,"that is hilarious ! i can see that as well , but that isr eally funny ."
1655,75,agent_1,"i wantt o know who thought it would be a great intimidation move , to aint the u o fia visito'rs locker room pink . to me , that is onpy proviring muchj needed ambiance to your opponetn ."
1656,75,agent_2,"that is xo funny , i guess it calms people donw seeing that folot so it makes sense to put it in the opposing teams locker room ."
1657,75,agent_1,"maybe the7 thought it would annoy the m, lol . it's interesting , when you realize that top bowlers used to make more than football players ."
1658,75,agent_2,"thay is interresting , it ges to show just how big the fnl has gotten since then ."
1659,75,agent_1,"i think engineers make more , as well ."
1660,75,agent_2,"over the average career they do , i think it takes in accounht how long thei rcareers are compared to pro sports plauers ."
1661,75,agent_1,"you do hafve a point . i have to get my kids , thanks for chatting with me . have a grdeatd asy ."
1662,76,agent_1,hi how are you '? football is on the chat menu . do you like football ?

1664,76,agent_1,was that georgia tech ? what was the coach thinking ? it seems cruel .
1665,76,agent_2,yes i agree . id efinitely would have quit once it hi t100 to 0 haha . i would have felt so bad to be cumberland that day
1666,76,agent_1,i hope the coach put in the htird string . it is just mean to bewt up a team like that . cumberland should no6 have schedulped that game anyway .
1667,76,agent_2,no i agree with you . do you like the pa5riots by the wazy ? have you heard of benjarvus greenellis ? apparently is never fumbled the blal which i think is awesome !
1668,76,agent_1,that is an astonishing vfeat . i hope hs got a raise or bonuz for that .
1669,76,agent_2,"yes that i8s amazing , do you ever watch football on televsion by the way ? apparently esp ncreated fthe line tha tshows firs downs when you're watching football on tv , and even won an emmy for doing thbat which is cool"
1670,76,agent_1,i am used to the superimposed graphics now . i never thought about which station started it all .
1671,76,agent_2,yes it was probably a technological achievement back then haha . did you know that females can actually play for the nfl of they qualify ?
1672,76,agent_1,"i guess if they are big enough , strong enough , fast enough . . . i wonder if anyw ill ever try out ."
1673,76,agent_2,"yeah i'm sure we might see a female nlf player someday , why do you think gmes take so long on tv yet apparnetly there is only sbou t10 minutes of actual live gazmeplay lol"
1674,76,agent_1,i think that it is the perfect sport for television . lots of time for commercials . lol
1675,76,agent_2,"haha i think you're right baout that ! what does make me sad though is tht cheerlewaders are not treated well in the nfl , apparently if they are in a restaurant eating and then a player walks and they would have to leave , doesn't seem fair"
1676,76,agent_1,"yeah , here is sill a lot of sexism in the league . some things chnage very sloly m it seems ."
1677,76,agent_2,yes i agree . what do you t9n kabout the patriots by the way ? were you happy that they won the superbowl this year
1678,76,agent_1,"actuqally , i wanted the oteh rteam , the underdog , tow in . i am tried f hte patriots winnin ."

1688,77,agent_1,did you know in th e60's top bowlers made more money than football players ?
1689,77,agent_2,i think that pro football wws getting going back then . i bet th eplayers didn6 even hav ea union then .
1690,77,agent_1,"good time for bowlets i guess , and less injuries ."
1691,77,agent_2,"yeah , plus a longer career . football players dont have long careers . a bad injury and that is it ."
1692,77,agent_1,"yes , i agree . i also found out htat whejn nfl or nba retire 78 percen tgo bankrupt withion 2 years !"
1693,77,agent_2,"that is terrible . these guys really need help managing money . they dont have careers after the league , so they need to survive on thoss earnings ."
1694,77,agent_1,"yeah true , unless they teach maybe ?"
1695,77,agent_2,"i guess soem of them could get coaching jobs , if they know how to coach . different skill ."
1696,77,agent_1,right . maybe sports announcer ? lol still different skill
1697,77,agent_2,"yeah , not many o ftnse jobs . these guys have played spotts their whole livws and dont know anything else ."
1698,77,agent_1,"theres a funning back who never fumbled the ball in his career , that ie amazing !"
1699,77,agent_2,"oh , that guy on the patriots ? yes , that is quite an accpmplishmnet , one for the record books ."
1700,77,agent_1,"i know right , i don tknow much about the patriots but i hear they ar eaccused ofc heating , i hope hat guy is nota part of it ."
1701,77,agent_2,"yeah , the cheating scandals are bad . bil b will never l8ve that down ."
1702,77,agent_1,i also hear he puts tom brady on the inured list everyw eek and hes not even injured .
1703,77,agent_2,"bill is crying wolf . trying to trick the other team . wontg work . anyway , great chat !"
1704,77,agent_1,"great chat , thanks !"
1705,78,agent_1,good morning ! d8d you knw that the nfl has no official rule against female players ?
1706,78,agent_2,i have heard that before . i wodner if any womne will be able to make the nfl one day .
1707,78,agent_1,i wonder . and what it could be the saints ! and they woldsn't be allowed to eat in the same restaurant as the cheerleders !
1708,78,agent_2,i'm mo treally into nfl . maybe it's because there are only1 1 miutes of live gameplay in each game .
1709,78,agent_1,"yes , i've had the same reaction go it . thges edays , there are too many ads and too mucy commentary with not enough action ."
1710,78,agent_2,"but nlf has become so oopular over the years . int he 60s , top bowlers msde twice as much as top football stars ."
1711,78,agent_1,yes ! i wonder why . were both sports televised ? was pay based on live attendance too ? it's jard to imahine bowling being as popular to watch on tv or as a live spectator .
1712,78,agent_2,i believe boaling was televised . my dzd told me he used to watch it on tv
1713,78,agent_1,"fascinating ! well, , it's still televised . i wonder if the datings really were higher than for football or if pay was based on something else ."
1714,78,agent_2,"but event oday , nfl players don't make as muhc on average as i would think . engineers earn more over a lifetime ."
1715,78,agent_1,"yes , and i'ts interesting to consider the lifetime career of a footbal lplayer . soem use their bafkground to transition to ofher fields such as coaching , or use the income to start a new career after they retire . sadly , others suffer injuries that limit the op6ionst hey ahve later on ."
1716,78,agent_2,it's amazing how much technology is used in the nfl these days
1717,78,agent_1,"yes , i was reading about the chips that they're using in shoulder pads . i hope the data they gather that way 3will be used to prevent injyries ."
1718,78,agent_2,and it's interesting how espn won a nemmy for that yellow ine they cre3ated .
1719,78,agent_1,"ye s, just a yello wlin ! i wonder if an emmy has ever been awarded for something so simple ."
1720,78,agent_2,it is very helpful to view football though .
1721,78,agent_1,yes . a simple thing can make a huge difference .
1722,78,agent_2,"yes , most of the best inventions are very simple . do you like the patriots ?"
1723,78,agent_1,"yes ! go pats ! iv'e never been to gillette stadium , but i've seen many games on tv ."
1724,78,agent_2,bill belichick ahs the mks twins in nfl posteason football20 with the patriots and 1 with the cleveland browne .
1725,78,agent_1,yes ! great team ! it's been good talking to you ! have a greqt day !

1730,79,agent_1,"omg , that is so weitd . yeash , of course i do ."
1731,79,agent_2,"oh , ok then . i guess we all have different childhoods . the tv is an influence on the mind . what do you like about the nfl gootball ?"
1732,79,agent_1,it?s interesting tow atch while you drink beer in a bar .
1733,79,agent_2,"oh , ok , it's an alcoholic event . i see . witht he shouting and cheering and whatnot . do you have a favorite tema or player ? i guess there are a bucnh of teams ."
1734,79,agent_1,"yup , goo time . of course , the redskins , great team to follow . lots of fun ."
1735,79,agent_2,the re3dskins ? are the namwed after the native americans ?
1736,79,agent_1,"yeah , they are . they have been dc's team for a long logn time ."
1737,79,agent_2,why the redskins though ? isn't that a name to mock the americn ind9ans ?
1738,79,agent_1,why ar etheyn amed that ? they were namedt hgaqt before i was born . they were named that 90 years ago i think .
1739,79,agent_2,"oh , ok . i thought that a team i washington woulf have a very american nqme , like the patriots or som4ething ."
1740,79,agent_1,"nope , they've been named that for a long time . i've nhever followed much of the naming conventions ."
1741,79,agent_2,"i see . i guess people choose the nam4e that suits the dspirit of the t4eam or the town . i have never been to washingtokn dc , ut i imagien there must be lots of native peoples there ."
1742,79,agent_1,"i;m not sure , but their baseball team is named the nationals if that hels . i think the patriots are named that bevause new england was one of te first states , right ?"
1743,79,agent_2,i did not know there was a state named new enlgand l i've heard o fnew york and new hampshire .
1744,79,agent_1,"interesting , i should clarify , so new england isn't a state , it is a region ser ethe first setlers were or soemthing like that ;"
1745,79,agent_2,"oh , i see . that is the place of the patriots . i think that nfl foobtall is an interesting lesso nin ush istory ."
1746,79,agent_1,"yeah , the ngl is funt o watch , i really enjoy it . well mice chatting with you !"
1747,80,agent_1,i hear the bears may have the highest paid defensive player in the history of the gam e.

1749,80,agent_1,taylo4r changfed the way hte game was played . you thin khe has that in him ?
1750,80,agent_2,he definitely looked impressive this year l. he earned the pay he received . he is the highest paid defensive player in the history of the game now .
1751,80,agent_1,did you know that the iowa state univedrsitiews coach had the visiting football teams locker rooms painted pink . talk about mind games .
1752,80,agent_2,"i did not . what a strange thing to do . speaking of footnall , did you nowt uat in the 1960's top bowlers made more than top football playerx ? !"
1753,80,agent_1,"wow , drink beer and bowl fro millions , sign em up coach . hey do you know waht the highest scored college game was ."

1763,80,agent_1,"wow ! well the patriots have so,ething in commpn with the nuffalo bills they bothh ave the same number of losses in the super bowl ."
1764,80,agent_2,9h wow . weveryone always talks about their wins but i did realiz4 they werea lso tied for llsses .
1765,80,agent_1,the clevelnad browns last playoff game was in 1995 .
1766,80,agent_2,they have been awful for a long tiem . theu seem to be better the last ysar .

1768,81,agent_1,hi hkw are you ? are you a footabll fan ? i have been discusing football quite a bi recently .
1769,81,agent_2,i don't mibd . i grew up aw skins fa n. you a fa n?
1770,81,agent_1,is ometies watch games . i try to watch the playoffs and rhe duper bowl . i like th ebay areat eams .
1771,81,agent_2,not a patriots fan ?
1772,81,agent_1,"f they were the udnerdog in a game , i would root for thekm . otherwise , no , not real;y .?"
1773,81,agent_2,george r . r aqmrtin called the patriits the ' lannisters ' of pro football lol .
1774,81,agent_1,i guess he thought they were theb ad guys ? u wonder .
1775,81,agent_2,does that mae the buffralo bills the ' starks ' ? they have had as mant supergowl losses as the patriots have had wins .
1776,81,agent_1,"yeah , the bills really have suffered a lot in the superbowl . it must bef rustrqting to get that fart and lose ."
1777,81,agent_2,imagine being the cleveland browns .
1778,81,agent_1,howm any times have the browns been tot he superbowl ?
1779,81,agent_2,"i don't think they evere have been actually . the last playoff win was in 9195 , against the patriots ."
1780,81,agent_1,that is a shame . i guess the fans musyt be frustrated . cleveland had lebron for a while though .
1781,81,agent_2,"yeah , until la lurded him away ."
1782,81,agent_1,"he is gettin gto the end of his career i think . 34 ie pretty old for basketbapl . he is a great player , olike brady , but eventually everyone leaves the game ."
1783,81,agent_2,it's tr7e . they all get ol d. maybe a female qb can replace bradry . there is apparently no actual restriction ijn fhe nfl .
1784,81,agent_1,"yeah , i dont think the guys writing th erules imaginef a day with a woman i nthe game . i wonder if one could ever get to that level ."
1785,81,agent_2,"i don't see why not . officilas ha dto stop the lead fvemale cyclisf i na recent race because she was overtaking the men's race . it may not b egreat for long term earnings though , whoever plays . an engineer can actually make more over a lifetime ."
1786,81,agent_1,cycling is different from football . usuallyf ootball requires a lot of muscle amss . cyclists are usulaly thin . engineering is the getterc hoice . not nearly so many concussions and injuries .
1787,81,agent_2,it makes you wonder ho well they truly fare after they retire . seems like brady hasm ade football a religious experience almost . whqt do you do wnhen that's gone ?
1788,81,agent_1,"you ajdust to a new life , build new interests , practice new hobbies . i figue that he can be an nanouncer ? a coach ? anyway , grt chat ."
1789,81,agent_2,indewd . ee you .

1792,82,agent_1,"the game wast oo defensiove for my taste , im happy because my team won but still i expected the game o be more exitim g."
1793,82,agent_2,weren't they tied dhring teh 2nd quater ?
1794,82,agent_1,"yeah the game was 33 up till the 3rd quarter i think , then the pats scored a touchdow nand history changed"
1795,82,agent_2,i stopped watchying it onfe it wa s133 .
1796,82,agent_1,"yeha it was towards the end , i know you said your not a football fan but do you have a favorite team ?"
1797,82,agent_2,i did not believe that it was their 6th win . i looked it up and their fkrst win was 2002 ! was tom brady in the team by 6hat year ? i hardly saw the rams in the chart winning the super bowl . the team i follow is the 49ers .
1798,82,agent_1,"yeah they ard the top nfl winners with hte steelers , and im nt sure , if e was i don think he was starting qb . bll belichick is a great coach though"
1799,82,agent_2,"that is insane . well , i hkpe the patriots keep doing what their doing . it's ab iv progress ! maybe , he had a great technique to keep the tema going strong ."
1800,82,agent_1,"he sure has a great strategy after all he is the wnningest coach in the nfl , that means his doing somethin gright"
1801,82,agent_2,how mqny wjins ?
1802,82,agent_1,"he had 21 wins , 20 with the patriots and th eremajining wiht th browns ,"
1803,82,agent_2,he coacehd 2t eam s. i see . . .
1804,82,agent_1,"yeah , 8 think he coahced more teams besides the two , you knowe the patiots also hold the record for supe rbow llosses ."
1805,82,agent_2,"well , no wonder they won in 2002 !"
1806,82,agent_1,"yeah , ive always wanted to visit thne gillete stadium , hoefu.ly one day i can watch the patriots play ."
1807,82,agent_2,"that stadum is large ! you will one day . all you got to do is get a job and earn all that to save for the next s7per bowl , if the patriots are in ."
1808,82,agent_1,"sounds like a solid plan i wonder how much ticker sare worth though , they mustb e really expensive , depending on the game at least ."
1809,82,agent_2,that is true . it will definitely be expnesive .
1810,82,agent_1,"yeah buy totall worth it , it salso a great chance to know foxborough"
1811,83,agent_1,"hi , do you waftch nf ?"
1812,83,agent_2,"helo tsre , i doh ow abou tyourself ?"
1813,83,agent_1,ye sme too . did you know women can play too ?
1814,83,agent_2,"i rea dthat , i tghink it is so cool and 3oyld bery cool if a feamle player did make a team ."
1815,83,agent_1,i hope so too . did you know a game hs only 11 minutes orf active gaemplay ?
1816,83,agent_2,isn't that crazy to think that is all ? i guess you don't really think about it when watching on tv .
1817,83,agent_1,right ? we are gluex to the tv for hours and i6 boild down to only 1 minutes
1818,83,agent_2,"riguht , sometimes for 3 uhours or so at a time . did you read about espn inning an emmy ?"
1819,83,agent_1,"yeah for the superimposed yellow lin e, strange to win an award though"
1820,83,agent_2,"it is a bit strange but it makes sense , thatl ine does help a ton whn watching the games on tv ."
1821,83,agent_1,i guess . did you know they put tracking ch8ps on the payers now ?
1822,83,agent_2,"yeah i read that , the game is getting more nad more advanced as it goes ."
1823,83,agent_1,yeah for sure . and that weir drule about new orleans cheerleaders ?
1824,83,agent_2,yeah that seems like such a silly outdated rule . i think that will be gone in the next yea ror two .
1825,83,agent_1,i hope so . did ypu know u of iowa's locker room for visitors is painted pink ?
1826,83,agent_2,"i thinkt hat is hilarious , i wonder who was inc harge over there ands aid it wa sok to do . i think o'tsc ool ."
1827,83,agent_1,yea hi wonder too . did you know bowlers made more than footabll players in t6he 60s ?
1828,83,agent_2,"isn't that wild , i guess f i could come back agakn , i would want to bw a top bowler in the 60s !"
1829,83,agent_1,"yeah for sure , go figure . do you know benjarvis greenellis ?"
1830,83,agent_2,yeah isn't he a back that never had a fumble in his career ?
1831,83,agent_1,"yeah , that is him . do yo8 know te highdst score in a football game ?"
1832,83,agent_2,"yeah it was 2220 ! crazy score ! well it was nicet alkin gto you , ih ope you have a good night ."
1833,84,agent_1,how do you feel about the patriots winning another super bowl ?
1834,84,agent_2,i feel let down and aggravated to be honst . it almost makesm e want to boycott gillette sinet hey sponso rthem . how d you feel ?
1835,84,agent_1,i hate it because they are so good . belichick is the winningest coach in pst season history .
1836,84,agent_2,"yeah i know . i can't help but wonder if he cheats in some way . on th eironic side though , they patriots are tied with the bills for the most losses at super bowls ."
1837,84,agent_1,they are really good at thinkkn goutside the box . cheating o rnkt . htey let the giants score near the end of super bowl 46 so they would have a cahnce . although it backfired on them
1838,84,agent_2,did you know that bill belichick used to coach tor the lceveand brown and that their last playoff win was whe nhe was their coach ?
1839,84,agent_1,its his only playoff win not for the patriots . so crazy we could of had a browns dynasty instead
1840,84,agent_2,i know . we may still yet if bake rmayfield has his way . football is so popular and importajnt that it's hard to believe that back in the1 960's bowler smade more than footbsll players .
1841,84,agent_1,ev3n more surprising is tha tthe zverahe life earnings of an engimneer is higher than that of an nfl player
1842,84,agent_2,now that is surprising . i always assumed players wer4 among the super rich . i would htink that benjarvus greenellis 2oudl especially be super rich . he has never fumbled the ball in his career and he?s a rumning back .
1843,84,agent_1,i wonder if hey could use htos etracking cbips to learn how he n4ever fumb.ed . that's very impressive
1844,84,agent_2,it really is and surprising . i had no idea until recently that the nfl put tracking chips in players shoulder pads .
1845,84,agent_1,it records a lot of stuff ! they even use them in the balls themselves
1846,84,agent_2,i've heard that . i guess that's how they knew brady was cheating that time . you know they do all of this studying and stuff and in reality a tame only has 121 minutes of qactula game playing .
1847,84,agent_1,that's really crazy . i wonder how much game time th 1916 game between veorgia tech and cubmerland had
1848,84,agent_2,"why , did that gamel ast a really long time or skething ?"
1849,84,agent_1,"yes , georgia tehc set the highest score ever ag 222"
1850,84,agent_2,ohm y ! i bet it did go on forever ! what was the oter team's score ?
1851,84,agent_1,cumberland did no tscore . it must have been pretty mebarrassing . there snould haveb een a mercy rule
1852,84,agent_2,with that kind of score i definiely agree . i guess cumberland not only had no defense but no offense as well .
1853,84,agent_1,hopefully the patriots don't ever get that good
1854,85,agent_1,hello ! do you like football ?
1855,85,agent_2,i do . do you ?
1856,85,agent_1,"of course ! what's our favorite team . mine is the new england patriots , the lannisters of the nfl !"
1857,85,agent_2,i like theb roncos . have you read the indentured by ben straussa nd joe nocera ?
1858,85,agent_1,"parts of it , i find it 9inteeresting that he thinkd the nfl has peaked ? hwat do you think o fthat ?"
1859,85,agent_2,"the games longtyerm survival as z slightf avorite , not doomed ."
1860,85,agent_1,i hope it's not doomed . but i wouldn' twan tmy kids to play footbal due to all the brain injuries . what's weird is that average lifetimee arbings of an engineer ie higher than the averag elifetime ezarnings of ann fl player and an saverage mlb playe r. what do you think could make the game be safer ?
1861,85,agent_2,wow i did npt know hat . i don't kno wif they could put more padding in the helmets or not . do you tyink comncussions or brokne b9ones are more commoh ?
1862,85,agent_1,"it seems lke conussions are more frequent and probably underreporte d. it certainly seems like a lot of injuries are happening when an average nfl game only ahs 11 minutes of live gameplay . the only real winners are the owners and the nfl corpofate entity , don'y you think ?"
1863,85,agent_2,yes . thee are differnt places that call different thgings foot ball . like what we know as soccer or rugby .
1864,85,agent_1,"rue ,a merican football is so much more high scoring though . 5h highest score ever in a football game occurred in 1916 when georgia tefh beat dumberland 2220 nowt hat's a lot of scoring ! who is the greatest coahc in the nfl right now ?"
1865,85,agent_2,"i am not sure , did you know snoop dog gwrote a fight song for his son's football team ?"
1866,85,agent_1,"i didn't know that ! gill belichick of course . . . he has won the ,ost nfl postseson games with 21 wins ."
1867,85,agent_2,is he the patriots coach ;
1868,85,agent_1,"yes . he is a coaching mastermind . near the end of super bowl 46 , the new york giqnts tried to avoid scoring a touchdown near the nd of the hameto avoid to mbrady an rbill beichick outsmarting thme . that's crazy !"
1869,85,agent_2,the patriots have either won or loat the super bowl by w4 points in the 6 tires .
1870,85,agent_1,"yep , that's how consistently good they have been . did you know that new orleans cheer;eaders are forbidden from eating in the same restauranta s any nfl player . if they are eatingt somewhere and an nfl player comes in , they have to leave ."
1871,85,agent_2,thats rude . i wonder why ?
1872,85,agent_1,they probably don't want any pr problems from that . it's kind of weird that there 8s no women in the nf l. gthere is no written rules agaijnst female players .
1873,85,agent_2,i heard about a woman trying to go pro last year .
1874,85,agent_1,that would be interesting to see when thath appens !
1875,86,agent_1,i enjoy footblal . are you a fan ?
1876,86,agent_2,"i enjoy sports . you mea namerican footbal;l , with th funny looking blal ? i've seen the game ."
1877,86,agent_1,yes american football . do you know what teh highest football score ever was ?
1878,86,agent_2,the highest score ? i have no idea . who were the teams ?
1879,86,agent_1,it was in 1916 between georgia tech and cumberland and the score was 2220 !
1880,86,agent_2,that is quite a humiliating score . i wonder why they did that . jt seems mean spieoted and unsportsmabnlikme .
1881,86,agent_1,i agree and i do not even know how it is poss8ble to score that many points in one game . did you also know htat in the 60's bowlers aede more than football players ?
1882,86,agent_2,i wonder how muhc money that actuially was back then . i guess i missed my window . i was born too late . i have the soul and body of a bowler .
1883,86,agent_1,it is certainly asn easier sport on your body . ghave you heard of benjarvus ellisgreen ? he was a rb for the patriots .
1884,86,agent_2,i hsave not heard of him . i she famous ? what did h edo ?
1885,86,agent_1,he played for the patriots and during his time with the team he never fumbled a ball !
1886,86,agent_2,that is ajazing ?. he must have enormous hands or somethin g. or special glovea .
1887,86,agent_1,it i very impressive . did you know that espn created the line tht shows the first down ? can you imagine waatching a game without that ?
1888,86,agent_2,"i cannot . i 5hought that it was an obvious thing to do , but i guess espn was thef irxt to do it . good fr them ."
1889,86,agent_1,it was a great inventio n. they even on an emmy for it .
1890,86,agent_2,that seems a bit much . an award for a line ? i wonder what's next . hm . wiould you want to be an engineer ? the average lifetime earnings o an engineer is higher than the average lifetime earnings of an nfl player
1891,86,agent_1,considering that it ;ays more i would much prefer it over a football career . it would be much easier on my body nad i'm not risking injury constantly .
1892,86,agent_2,fa fewer concussion stoo . i would ratehr that women went into engineering . it would be easier on them .
1893,86,agent_1,apparently the nfl has no written rules against female players .
1894,86,agent_2,that would makef or an interesting contest . the fans wouldb e uncomvortable i htink .
1895,86,agent_1,i'm not sur ewhy . t would be difficult for many positions because of the size of the other players but i see no readson why youc oudln't have a female kicker .
1896,87,agent_1,"hey ! are you a footb,lal fan ?"
1897,87,agent_2,i am . have you seen khali lmack play ? he's one of th best linebavckers i've seen since lawrence taylor !
1898,87,agent_1,"i dont follow him personally , but i hace heard great things abot him ."
1899,87,agent_2,"he's really good , bill belichick and lawrence taylor don't seem to think he com;wres to taylor tuough ."
1900,87,agent_1,"taylor is fzther iconic m maybe overt ime thdir opinions might chanyge . mack seems to be pretty talented , lets see if he stands the t6est of time ."
1901,87,agent_2,i thknk he will . taylor was a beaet on the field though . i remember when he brokej oe tehismann's leg on monday night football .
1902,87,agent_1,"wow . i rot remember tha6 , but i tsounds awful"
1903,87,agent_2,"yeah , i think it was an accidwent , but still ."
1904,87,agent_1,"that is some serious power . i can see why there arent female football players , even though there is no rule against them . i wouldnt wnt to be hit by that ."
1905,87,agent_2,"i agr4ee with that . the average football players weigh , what 225 lbs ? the average woman can't hol that kind of mass to protect themselves ."
1906,87,agent_1,p.us they adej't exactly treating cheerleaders equitably .
1907,87,agent_2,"yeah , i heard that the saints cheerleaders are forbidden fron eating in the same restaurant as any nf lplayer and they even have to leave if w player come in while 5hey're eatijng . that is rodiculous !"
1908,87,agent_1,"it really is , i wonder what happened to make tat rule ."
1909,87,agent_2,"i don't know , it' skiden of shady ."
1910,87,agent_1,"anyway , dfid you know bellichick is the winningest coach in post season football , 21 wins !"
1911,87,agent_2,"yeah , bhe's had 20 with the patriots and 1 wit hthe brown s. has the browns ha da playoff win since him ?"
1912,87,agent_1,"probably not . lol . they're one of those historiclaly bad teams ,"
1913,87,agent_2,yeah tbey ard . at least my bills are on par with hte patriots . . . in super bowl losses .
1914,87,agent_1,"lol l the patriotxs will likley out do that soon , or maybe they will just win it every year for the rest of time lol"
1915,87,agent_2,"itds' possible , i agree with the author of ' a game if thronew , ' they are the lannisters of tyhe nfl ."
1916,87,agent_1,lol . nice chat ! hawve a grewat day !

1918,88,agent_2,i do love football ! how abou tyoy ?
1919,88,agent_1,"yes , i love to go to the games ? what do you think of thd patriot s?"
1920,88,agent_2,i like teh patriots ! i'm glad that they won the super bowl . tom brady puts a lot of work into his game and deserves to be a winner for his dedication to being the best he can be .
1921,88,agent_1,"i agree with you ! i love the team too ! ! tom's plan for a good life is joy , peak performance and avocado icedream !"
1922,88,agent_2,ool is that from his book ? i haven't read it but am somewwhat familiar with it . an interest history tidbit . . . . the cleveland br5wns last playoff win was in 1q995 against the patriot san dbelichick was the head coach of the browns !
1923,88,agent_1,"really , itneresting . yeah , i have never tried avocado icecream , thinking if they qadd enougu sugar would be okay ! the patrots have a devotedg roup of fans !"
1924,88,agent_2,i know i wouldn't like the ice cream because i don't like avocados . lol i just read that the jackson victory tour played a majior role inr obert kraft buying sullivan stadium and eventually the patriots . i'm going toh ave to look deeper into that .
1925,88,agent_1,"oh really , i didn't know tat . in super bowl loses the new england patriots and buffalo bills are the same ."
1926,88,agent_2,i didn't know htat . what do you think of the tracking chips the nfl has embedded in players shoulder pads and footballs ? wonder if they wi.l help improve the game .
1927,88,agent_1,i think its a great idea ! i wonder if it helps with inglated footablls ? lol
1928,88,agent_2,lol my first thought was that they could program the chips in the footballs to go tot he othe rchips in the shoulder pads .
1929,88,agent_1,"lol , thats' funmny ! ! did you know the games of hrones author calls the new england parriots the lannisters oft he nfl !"
1930,88,agent_2,hahaha i didn't know tbat ! funny stuff ! do you like snoop dogg ? he wrote a fight song flr his sons high school footbzll team !
1931,88,agent_1,"no , i didn't know that ? an7 good ? isn't it interesting ther eis only 11 minute sof live gameplay in the nfl !"
1932,88,agent_2,isn't that a short amount of tim efor a game theys trethc out to 3 hours ? i'm not sure if the song is any g9od . i know his son is a highly recruitefd player for college and is really good .
1933,88,agent_1,"really , i ridn't konow that either . i know its crazy how long it takes ."
1934,88,agent_2,"14 of the world's largest stadiums belong to american cxollege football teams . i believw there's a few that sea tover 100 , 000 !"
1935,88,agent_1,i bet at lrast one of tfhem is in texas ! ! bi gfootball state ! how do you feel about pink locker rooms ? ll
1936,88,agent_2,yes it i s! wha't sthe saying they have . . . everything is bigger in texas ? lol i'm not familia rwith pink locker rooms ? are they for breast cancer awarenes ?
1937,88,agent_1,"should be , university of iowa painted the visitors locker foom pink ! good chat ! !"
1938,88,agent_2,they must have did that to get in the minds of the vis8ting team . lol i enjoyed the chat !
1939,88,agent_1,",ol , i think your right ! ahve a good night !"
1940,88,agent_2,you hwve a goodn ight too !
1941,89,agent_1,ehy there do you like the sehaawksb y the way ? i guess richard sherman is bout to become a free agent
1942,89,agent_2,i don't htough i remembe rthem winning a super bolw . i am not really into football .
1943,89,agent_1,"i 2ould like some of football . i really like the patriots , and i also think it's interesting how i5 is split between two conferences , the nfc and the afc"
1944,89,agent_2,the seahawks almost beat the patriots in one super bowl but did not ebcayse of a play call a the one yard lien .
1945,89,agent_1,"yeah that's pretty crazy . i also think it's drazy that the nfl does not have a rule against female players , do you think we will ever see a female player ?"
1946,89,agent_2,well there is a kickerw ho plays on the men's football team and she js one of our best bets .
1947,89,agent_1,"so ijteresting i didn't know tha . i also didn't know that he average game only lasts about 10 or 11 minues , the rest is fjlled with just lining up , commercial , and refs making decisions"
1948,89,agent_2,that might be why it does not interest me juch . that and i cannot follow the ball . the uellow line helps a bit . espn got an emmy for it .
1949,89,agent_1,yep that was really smart invention . it wasa slo a smart invention for the nfl to put tracking chips into their uniforms . that way tney can check teh players spred and location in realt ime
1950,89,agent_2,"yeah , so interesting how footabll has progressed , probably because there is so much interest in it . in the 60s taht was not the case as top bowlers ,ade twice as much as top football stars ."
1951,89,agent_1,you're right thats' realy crazy . i should have been a profeszsional bowler because i have a better shot at doing that haha . what do you think abolut thse patriots by the way ? i think i mentioned its my favorite team
1952,89,agent_2,i think they are a great yeam ! bell bellichi8ck is tue nfl coach with the ost postsasokn wins
1953,89,agent_1,"yep i agree , i love that they play at gillette stadium , i miss the days though when teams played at a stadium named aftsr the city and not one named acter a razor lol"
1954,89,agent_2,"haha , funny . have you been to thei rgames ?"
1955,89,agent_1,"no i'v enever been to an actua, game , but i do watch them on tv , have yo ever seen the show game of thrones by the way ?"
1956,89,agent_2,"no , it never cauhht my attention . is oemtimes watch footbwall on tv but mostly only at super bowl parties on the first sunday ij february"
1957,89,agent_1,"game of thrones is pretty cool , the only reasoh i bring it up isb ecause the author says that the patriots are like the .anisters in gsame of thrones , nad theya re wactually the bad guys lol"
1958,89,agent_2,"oh , that is pretty funny . i guess the browns were good at one point . their last playoffv win was in 95 against the patriots . their head coach was bil lbelichick"
1959,89,agent_1,yeah he's a great coach tor sure . he's also the most winningest coach in the nfl postseason . very imprerssive i think
1960,89,agent_2,at the end of super bowl 46 the patriots let the gians score a touchdown znd the giants tried to avoi scoring a touchdown . i guess this was to increase their odds of winning . the giants scored a touchdonw but won anyway .
1961,89,agent_1,"yeah hat was a crazy gqme . funny too that the last time the cleveland brownsw on the superbowl was ubder bikl's coaching too , he's amazing"
1962,90,agent_1,have you heard oc dez bryant ?
1963,90,agent_2,"yeah , his a wde receiver dight ? it looks like his having a tough time getting a job or maybe he just wants to rest for a while"
1964,90,agent_1,"yea h, he was a first round draft pick by the cownoys in 2010 but was cut in april . ouch , that's gotta hurt ."
1965,90,agent_2,"his got impressive carreer thouhg , 531 catches , 73 touhcdowns , all in 8 seasons"
1966,90,agent_1,"yeah , he says that he still can ply the gam ."
1967,90,agent_2,"aybe the ptriots can sign him , i heard they are having a tough time sigining a wide receiver , on that can be edelmans replacement when his suspended or injured"
1968,90,agent_1,bryant turned down at hree year offer from baltimore in th espring because he thought he could get somehting better . i wonder if he regrets that .
1969,90,agent_2,"i bet he does regrt it , baltimore is not the best team but they do alright nad i think the pay is decent , it was a 3 year offer afterall sojmetimes greediness makes us takd the wrong call ."
1970,90,agent_1,you'r igh t! u heard that the browns and the patriots have kicked the tires on bryant .
1971,90,agent_2,do it seems like you like to watcg footabll are you a fan of any team in particular ?
1972,90,agent_1,"no , i don't like to watch football . i did go to a super bowl party in order to pib out on food , ahha . how about you ?"
1973,90,agent_2,"lol ,w ell superbowl food is great ! and i do like the sport , i lik eto watch college footbalk ss well , you know the uni8versity of iowa has thei rvisitors lockers painted completely ! !"
1974,90,agent_1,"hmm , interesting . i guess football doesn't really catch my at6tention becauet here are only 11 minutes of live gamepaly ."
1975,90,agent_2,"it sdems like a lot more though , my favorite team are the pat4iots , someone called tjem the lannisters of the nfl , o thought taht was a funny reference"
1976,90,agent_1,interesting ! bill belichick has ha teh most wins out of coaches in nfl postseason football with 21 wins .
1977,90,agent_2,"yeah , apparenty one of them was with the rbowns , bill belichick is a great coach , he's oe of the main reasons of the team's success this season"
1978,90,agent_1,"yeah , that sesms to have bee in 1995 . that was he browns' last playoff wins ."
1979,90,agent_2,"yeah , the pats are the team to have most wisn in the superbowl but i didnt kno wthey are alsot he team with the most losses ."
1980,90,agent_1,"hm , interesting . the patriots play at the gi,lette sgtadijum . have you watched a game there ?"
1981,90,agent_2,"no i havent , yickets are usually expensive and i prefer to just watch the gam efrom home , its amazing how the team is one of the most successful ones in the histoy of nfl , the team has incredible stats"
1982,90,agent_1,"yeah , they are a great team for sure ."
1983,91,agent_1,hi buddy ! are you a patrio6td fan ?
1984,91,agent_2,yes i lovre the patriot sl how about you ?
1985,91,agent_1,"yes , although i also hold a fondness for the cleveland conscientious objecgors . they rarely show up for a football game . i also like the bills ."
1986,91,agent_2,i think pro football would have been better off if the nfl and the afl had not merged in 1966 .
1987,91,agent_1,"yeah , but thej th ebils wouodb ot be considered equal to the patriots . . . in number of superbowl losses ."
1988,91,agent_2,only bill i know is bill belichijck .
1989,91,agent_1,"he is the man ! you know , the last time the browns won a playoff game was 1995 . they beat the patriots . and belicheck wa the coach of cleveland then !"
1990,91,agent_2,"that is an interesting factoid , friend . i've heard some writer guy called the new england patr8iots the lannister sof the nfl ."
1991,91,agent_1,nice . i think we shoukld cast perer donklage as bill belichick in the movie .
1992,91,agent_2,only i feh winw in the end . did you know that there is no rule that women can'tb e in the nfl ? they only have to pass eligibility requirements .
1993,91,agent_1,"yeah , but the average nfl game is only 11 mihutes of playing time . i know jy wife wouldn't qulaify because she is never less than 11 minufes late for anything ."
1994,91,agent_2,"well , with the averwage lifetime earning of an engineer being higher than the averagel ifetime earnings odf an nfl player , i'd say you are better off ."
1995,91,agent_1,i would encourage her t be a new orleans cheerleader . that way she would not eb allowed to eat wirh th efootball players .
1996,91,agent_2,"hmmm i s4eem 6to recall they can eat the same thing , just not a tthe same place ."
1997,91,agent_1,"i guess i will all back on plan b : i will install thjose nflt racking chips in my wifes clothing . tha tway i canm onitor the velocity , 5otat9on , and location like tye nf; does tk thei5 playrs ."
1998,91,agent_2,sounds like a great plan to me !
1999,91,agent_1,"and i hope to superimpose those virtual yellow lines in front of department stores too . i won't get an emmy like espn did when they made htem for tv , but i will be able to trakc my wife's yardage ."
2000,91,agent_2,excellent plna . did you know that football codes can bet raced back to the codification of football games at englis public schools during the ninetweenth century ?
2001,91,agent_1,"i did no5t . but i gave up codification as my new year'sr esolution . i was obdessed with it . i used to walk around muttering , ' 2220 , 2220 ' ."
2002,91,agent_2,thats' a sound resolution m just like the patriofs superbowl win
2003,91,agent_1,"i wish benjarvus ellisgreen had playred in that game ! i would have bet that eh woudln oth ave fumbled , since he never did his entire career ! nice chatting with you !"

2009,92,agent_2,"yea , the saint's cheerleaders arne't allowed to eat in the same restaurants a smen , pretty unfair"

2013,92,agent_2,"yea , hopefully they will change that rule soon"
2014,92,agent_1,hope so too . now they are using trackign chips on the players
2015,92,agent_2,"that's prettyh cokl , they can find out how hard a player hits and moves with thse chips"
2016,92,agent_1,"yes ,v ery handy . do you know what the highes tscore is in football hstory ?"

2038,93,agent_2,yes as there is no rule againsg them playing if they qualify
2039,93,agent_1,yeah i hope we get to see them in the field at some point
2040,93,agent_2,yeah me too . hte gameplay is only 11 minutes anyways
2041,93,agent_1,yes and yet we are lgued to the tv for hkurs on end
2042,93,agent_2,"i knoiw , so ironic engineers apparently make moe than football players ove rthe lifetime"
2043,93,agent_1,yes but they have longer careers too so maybe tha thleps
2044,93,agent_2,true . did you know they are using chip on the players now to track stuff
2045,93,agent_1,"yeah pretty high tech , nice chat today"
2046,94,agent_1,are you a fan of the nfl ?
2047,94,agent_2,"hi , i watch occasionally . most big gaems like super bowl ."
2048,94,agent_1,"i didn' t3atch the super bowlt bis year . the patriots won again , right ?"
2049,94,agent_2,"yes they did . the coach belichick is the winningest coah in nlf postseason footbal, with 21 wins l 20 of those with the pats ."
2050,94,agent_1,"yesah , and thd only time the browns have won since 95 was when h ewas their coach !"
2051,94,agent_2,"wow , in ;osing super bowls , the pat sand buffalo bills are tied ."
2052,94,agent_1,i tjink it's funny that george rr martin calls the patriots the lannisters of the nfl .
2053,94,agent_2,did you know that formr pat benjarvus greenellis never fumbled a football in his nfl career ?
2054,94,agent_1,"haha , guess you do not think 8t's funny . no , i didn't know that . that's an incredibly cool achievement ! did you knoaw womenc an technically play football ?"
2055,94,agent_2,"that is pretty cool and i sayw hy not ? as long as they meet eligibility requirements and want to do it and a team actually picks em . : ,"
2056,94,agent_1,"it?s a pretty sexist industfy , so i can understand why a lot of women wouldn't want to play ."
2057,94,agent_2,true but i bet they could do the 11 minutes of live gameplay that the average nfl game has .
2058,94,agent_1,"oh , fo rsure . i think more women should become engineers ! they'll make ore money !"
2059,94,agent_2,or become like the 1960s top bowlers who made 2x as much as top footabll stars .
2060,94,agent_1,"haha , well then w9men will have to be tim etravelers . it sucks to be a femlae cheerleader for the saints , though . they have to leave a restaurant if a saints palye rwalks in ."
2061,94,agent_2,yea that does ! i thi8nk they have to leave if an nfl player from an7y team is in the restaurant . like how do you know al lnfl players . is that even possibel ?
2062,94,agent_1,that's even worse . how sexis t!
2063,94,agent_2,yeah that's a weirtd rule . somethingm st have happened for that rulet o come about .
2064,94,agent_1,"i can't imagine anything happenig that warranted orcing the women to leave ovet the male players . why wouldn't they have the players just not sit down ? the cheerleaders literallyg have to get up midmeal and elave ? an6way , this has been a fun chat ."
2065,94,agent_2,same here ? i liek that the univ of iowa has a pink locker room for their visiting football teams . how rude ! lol
2066,94,agent_1,"yeah , i guess . i think pink can be a pow3rful color ! haha . have a good opne ."
2067,95,agent_1,"hello ! are you a big football fan ? : ,"
2068,95,agent_2,"hi there , i am a fan , but not a huge fan , i do follow my team closely thoygh . how about you ?"
2069,95,agent_1,i used to be more into it when i was younger . i lived in loyuisiana for a while so it'sf unny they brought up the saints . what' syour tam ?
2070,95,agent_2,"i am from wisconsin , so i follow the packers , we didn't even maoke the playoffs this year , wo disappointing ."
2071,95,agent_1,"i bet ! the packers fans seem tob e really into football , very dedicated to their tema . have you bene to any nlf or college games ? i've lpassed by the super dome 8n louisiana ."
2072,95,agent_2,"i have been to a few games , and i have been to louisiana and wsaw thews uper doe as well . i wokuld like to go back there now that i am older ."
2073,95,agent_1,"that would be fun ! it's crazy to think about ho wmany people have beent o that super dome , tom brady has probably been there a bunh ."
2074,95,agent_2,yeah i know he has won a few games there . did you know he was picked 19th baci in the 2000 nfl draft ?
2075,95,agent_1,"i did not ! he's been aroudn for a while , 'm sur0rised he hasn't retired yet . his history as a footabll player is impressive . been to the uper bowl 8 times with the patriots ."
2076,95,agent_2,"ydah he sure has , i doj't think he will retiref or at least two more seasons ."
2077,95,agent_1,"wow , he's trying toh ang around for a while . i don't blame him though , i kind of wish peyton manning stayed arounde for a while longer , i liked him ."
2078,95,agent_2,"yeah he was a really good quarterback as well , i thought eh waqs pretty funny as we;l ."
2079,95,agent_1,somethinh that was funny to me while reading thes earticles i sthatt om brady has never eaten a strawberry before lol i wonder what's so scary about a strawberry
2080,95,agent_2,"thawt is insdane , i don't know how yoh can be as old as he is and note at a ztrawberry ."
2081,95,agent_1,"yeah , a lot of weirdt hings about food in these aryicles actually . it said in the factual section 2 that new orleans saints cheeeleaders are forbidden from eating in teh same restaurant ass any nfl player , if an fl player comes into the restaurant they have to leave . that's crazy ."
2082,95,agent_2,"htat is crazy , that rule seems so outdated and silly . imagine a cheerleader geting up nad elaving ."
2083,95,agent_1,"that would be sad , if i wa sa cehereader and had to leave i would at leas6 watn ti fijish mym eal first . double standards really ."
2084,95,agent_2,yeah it really is double stazndardd and that type of thing is old and not normal anymore .
2085,95,agent_1,"maybe in 2019 tney'll change that . i've heard that cheerleadersd on't make very much moneh eiter , which is a shame because they put a lot of work into keeping their bodies pretty much perfect ."
2086,95,agent_2,7eah that is also a shmae when you consider how much players make .
2087,95,agent_1,wel it's been nice twlking to you ! i hope the res tof your day goes well !
2088,95,agent_2,"same here , i hope you have a good night ."
2089,96,agent_1,hell ! so do you folow football ?
2090,96,agent_2,"hi ! i do occasionally , usually duringb ig games like super boe; ."
2091,96,agent_1,"me too , i really don't watch much but i do kike footba;o . i think tom brady is an excell3ent quarterback ."
2092,96,agent_2,"i ag4ree , though he is now in his 40s born in august 1977 . wonder if he might retir esoon ?"
2093,96,agent_1,"hmmm , good question . he has done so much andc onsidered the best quarterback of all time , so maybe . i think he is due some tiem to have some fun the rest of his life ! the nfl probably won't want him to retire nay time soon , lol . . . . . ."
2094,96,agent_2,"not if they are smart . he is one of only 2 players in nfl history to have won 5 super bowls . well , i guess it woulx be 6 no w."
2095,96,agent_1,right ? i bet he has more time before he moves on . football woudl not be the sanm for awhile . but as lal football players retire another one comes along .
2096,96,agent_2,"that is true . he wont be easy to forget though especially to pats fabs . eh has qb'd them to 8 super bowls , the most of any player in history ."
2097,96,agent_1,"ow , o didn't know tha t. i like the patriot's . but you are right they will never be the saem . just like another pat's player , benjarvus green ellis . . . . neerf umbled a football his entire nfl caree ."
2098,96,agent_2,"yeah that' samazing . hey , did you realize that the average nfl gam eonly has 11 minutes of live game play ?"
2099,96,agent_1,"it does ? that is crazy ! rhe gsame seems to last a very lon time , but they do stop a lot . kinda crazy , just like how an engineer makes more money in their lifetime than an nfl player , but nfl players probably work fewer years than an engineer ."
2100,96,agent_2,yeah and engineering requires a lot of knowledge qnd schooling . back in the 60's top bo2lers made 2x as mucha s top football players . that is very surprising to me .
2101,96,agent_1,"wow . ; . that is nuts ! never would think that lol , maybe the next big star will be a female since the nfl have no written rules against femles as long as all requifrements ard met . ya never know l."
2102,96,agent_2,"that would be different . maybe they could get a pink locker room like the univ of iowa has for its visitung football teams . : , so bad ! !"
2103,96,agent_1,"haha , rihgt ! that is crazy . it's not any differnet than the crazy high score fgam ethat ended with 2202 that's unbelievable !"
2104,96,agent_2,yeah htat was awful for the losing team i bet . they probably could have benefited from 5he tracking chips they use today i nthe payers' shoudler pads to record their moves . maybe could have figured out whar they we4e doing wron g.
2105,96,agent_1,"exactly ! good point l did you know tom vrady's wifem akes more than twice the amount of money thyat tom does ? ? he could definitely retre hahaa , tha'ts a lot of mone4y !"
2106,96,agent_2,yeah but very few has her body and talents so alas they play fooball or work regular ole jobs . lol
2107,96,agent_1,"hahaha , i don't even know what she does but wow , that's still a lot of money ."
2108,96,agent_2,"she's a brazilian model , victoria's secret , anc one of the nighest paid in the world . she and brady mame a pretty ool tezm though both deserve what they work hard for ."
2109,96,agent_1,"oh , ok . i didn't know that , she must be great ti be the highest paid model ! just like her husband ! great team and marriage i'm sur . hopefully tom brady will stay in the nfl fo ea few more years ! we need gdeat players . it has been great chatting ! you have a great evening ! ! !"
2110,97,agent_1,"hi ,l do y9u like football ?"
2111,97,agent_2,"i love the sport , do you have as favorite team ? afc or nfc ?"
2112,97,agent_1,nfc and the ebars . you ?
2113,97,agent_2,afc nad teh ew england patriots
2114,97,agent_1,nice ! you've nhad a great runl ately then . did you celebrate hteir sb win ?
2115,97,agent_2,"no , not really , bill belichick got served , that is a sure thing but other than htat i have no idea"
2116,97,agent_1,i thought bill had a great game plan . he limited the offensive genius to lije 3 0points .
2117,97,agent_2,"yeah the game was a bit boring tjugh , i though tit was going to havem ore action in it"
2118,97,agent_1,it waes boring but bil lusually wins the boring ones . there is only 1 qminutes of play so maybe that is why .
2119,97,agent_2,"i guess better to wihn in a boring way than to lose in an exitimg form , ahd 11 minuyes don't seem like much"
2120,97,agent_1,"yeah , aa a bears fan , i just wan twins ! i could use like a decade of them like you guys ."
2121,97,agent_2,"yeah we have been pretty lucky and then theres also brady , his a good luck charm"
2122,97,agent_1,"i know , plus he's dreamy ! i mean , that's a good looking dude ."
2123,97,agent_2,"i ahve tko give it to him , grea tathl;ete and also has a smoking hot wife so he has just about everything in life"
2124,97,agent_1,don't you kind of hate those guys ? good at everything and has everything ? at elast i ahbe eaten strawberries !
2125,97,agent_2,"i kind of do , i wish i had a 03th part of what he has or evenl ess lol , nad that is weird , how can he not like strawberries or egven try them"
2126,97,agent_1,"going back to his youth , eh never had a strawberry ? if not , he is seriously missing out . i had a strawberry protein shake this morning , made wit hreal stawberries !"
2127,97,agent_2,"strawberries are so tasty , i couldn't live without them . he has a good td pass reford though ."
2128,97,agent_1,"yeah , i remember that randy moss season with 50 tds ajd it was magical !"
2129,97,agent_2,and prior to that season he never threw 30 td pass3es in a season so yeah magiocal
2130,97,agent_1,"it was nice chattinv with you , have a great day !"
2131,98,agent_1,"hello , how much do you know about football ?"
2132,98,agent_2,"i know a bit , ifs crazy how an average nfl game has only 11 minutes of live gameplay ."
2133,98,agent_1,"yes it is , aslo i dind't know they had microchips in the shoulder pads and blal ."
2134,98,agent_2,"i didtn knoq that either , what are the microchips in thos eareas for ?"
2135,98,agent_1,the7 are placed there to track the movement odf players and statistics of the ball like velocity .
2136,98,agent_2,"its interesting how technology has advanced , they must be pretty strong in order to handle thed amagr ."
2137,98,agent_1,yeah that' for sure . i really though thtat players earned alot more money thouygh .
2138,98,agent_2,"maybe the mvp buta n engineer wjll earn more money than the nfl player , i think soccer players are paid better"
2139,98,agent_1,crazy tl think that on eteam scored 222 points in a game once t0oo .
2140,98,agent_2,"really ? what team was that , the other team must have been less skilled"
2141,98,agent_1,georgia tech adn i agree especially when the othert am scored 0 .
2142,98,agent_2,"that must be the worst defeat in football history , what do you think about tom brady ?"
2143,98,agent_1,i p4rslnally don't like him but i respect his talent for winning so many superbowls .
2144,98,agent_2,"he is really talented , he threw 50t ouchdown passes in 2007 , what team are you a fan of ?"
2145,98,agent_1,"i'm a san frnacisco fa n, i wish they ahd wo nin tjeir last superbowl appearance ."
2146,98,agent_2,when was their last superbowl appearance ?
2147,98,agent_1,"2012 or 2014 i can't remember , i don't pay that much attention to sports ."
2148,98,agent_2,"i see , well i ma a patriots fan , did you mnow that a former rb benjarvus greenellis never fumbled in his entire nfl career ?"
2149,98,agent_1,no i didn't know that . that has to be a fecord that only he has .
2150,98,agent_2,i think he is teh sole holder of the record .
2151,98,agent_1,"i canm't bheliweve in the1 960's , bowlers made more thna football stars ."
2152,98,agent_2,"htat i sreally razy , i cant imagine bowlers earning more tha nthe lowes tpaid football player ."
2153,99,agent_1,do you think tom brady is really ready to retire ?
2154,99,agent_2,i don't kow . the consensus among the experts seemns to be that he'll keep playing .
2155,99,agent_1,"why is that ? his wife makes a ton of money , too ."
2156,99,agent_2,"yteah , and he?s been spending a lot of time on his charity wor . football doesn't seem to be his main priority ."
2157,99,agent_1,"yet , he continues . his buddy gronk may also retire ."
2158,99,agent_2,"yes , i heard that too ."
2159,99,agent_1,"with three kids and a supermodel wife , why taek a chance on getting permanently hurt ?"
2160,99,agent_2,"right , and he'eb een talking about wanting to be there for hisf amily more ."
2161,99,agent_1,plus hs training ' guru ' guerrero was kicked off the patriots' campus .
2162,99,agent_2,"yes , and that's caused swome tensions within the team .l"
2163,99,agent_1,i think the pats made a mistzke trading away jimmy garoppolo .
2164,99,agent_2,ye s! i agree !
2165,99,agent_1,he is doing very well in sf . . . when he isn't hurt .
2166,99,agent_2,did you know taht the nfl has ho written ruke againstf emale players ? womrnw ould in fact be allowed if they me tthe league's ekigibility requirements .
2167,99,agent_1,"a few women have played in col;lege , minly in noncontact positions ."
2168,99,agent_2,i didn ot know that ! i wonde4 how many have tried out tor the nfl .
2169,99,agent_1,i don't think any have tried . it would have bene big news .
2170,99,agent_2,yeah . i wonder if it 3ill ever happen .
2171,99,agent_1,"my son's modified grade 8 has a girl playing the ofensive line . she was actualy the smallest lineman , but played with great technique and was fearless , she was well respected ."
2172,99,agent_2,that's sawesome ! good for your son's team !
2173,99,agent_1,"it was great talking to you , have a great day ."
2174,100,agent_1,wre you a rams fan ? the rams and saints get together really showed lff their ksills with the saints winnign 4535
2175,100,agent_2,"i'm not a rams fan , they switch cities w3ay too often for my taste ."
2176,100,agent_1,michael thoams fom teh saints made a 72 yard touchdown pass with just less htan 4 minutes to play
2177,100,agent_2,"i xaw that , that is pretty amazing . the game pitted a young couch that was only 32 versus a 54 year old coach , pretty crazy6 the age differential tehre ."
2178,100,agent_1,"yes , soemti,mes fresh ideas . hope to see some females in thel eague someday . thdre is no rul against it if they meet the league's eligibility ."
2179,100,agent_2,fmeale football players are fairly common in hihg school in the u . s .
2180,100,agent_1,"we may see some thn . however , some alarming rulss in the nfl make me eonder . new orleans saints cheerleaders areen't allowe dto eat in the same restaurant as any nfl player and have to leave a diner if ann fl player comes in after"
2181,100,agent_2,"thawt is a fairly standard rule with nfl teams ,t he washington redskins cbeerleaders arem't allowed to fratenrize with the players either ."
2182,100,agent_1,if you were to watch an nfl game it would only have 11 minutes of live gameplay on average .
2183,100,agent_2,"i watch football every weekend . that is lrobably accurate , i'm surprised that it is 11 mihutes at all to be honest ."
2184,100,agent_1,if you want a job that maeks more in a lifetime than an average fl player or mlb player you can become an negineer
2185,100,agent_2,"i saw that , uit isa probably because there a bunch of players taht last only a year or so . i'm nots urprised , engineers make a lot of money ."
2186,100,agent_1,if you were a bowler in fthe 1960's ylu cioild have made twice as much as top football sta5rst oo .
2187,100,agent_2,"i knoa , it quite popular in the 1960s ."
2188,100,agent_1,one upset football game in fotball waa in1 91 6when georgia tech beat cumberland 2220 . i wonde rwhy they shamed the team so much ?
2189,100,agent_2,i saw that . i didn't know tuat tom brady was listed on the injury report every week .
2190,100,agent_1,i didn't know that . it seems strange you can do that . tom brady has never thrown 30 touchdown passes in a season before2 007y then he threw 50 that year .
2191,100,agent_2,"i know , he's a great quarerback . i'm surprised he'x never eaten a strawberry in his life ."
2192,100,agent_1,maybe he is worred about allergies ? a lot 0of peole are allergic . his wife actully makes moret han double bis salary . thsy must have a little bit of money .
2193,100,agent_2,that could be so . i had never thought about that to be honest .
2194,100,agent_1,"as the person writing article section 2 says , i alwo like being the underdog and going for the win . have a goo day !"
2195,101,agent_1,"hi , do you watxh football ?"
2196,101,agent_2,i sure do . did ou watch tom brady's rec9rdsettting superbowl peeformance ?
2197,101,agent_1,i did . don't you thjnk it i funny there is only 11 minutes of gmaeplay
2198,101,agent_2,"yeah , and most of that is predictbale . the fnl uses racking chips in equipment and balls to monitor everdything , and all of this for 11 minutes oer game . . ."
2199,101,agent_1,i kow . i wonder what info they collect wit hthose
2200,101,agent_2,"balp speeds , player location , etc . they also probably tracck playe roff the field too . in new orelasn , thec heerleaders are not allowed to dine with the players . how would they know unless they trwck them ?"
2201,101,agent_1,yeah and hte worst part is that theg have to leavfe mid meal of the players come in
2202,101,agent_2,"nflh as no written rul eagainst female players , but don't let the eat together !"
2203,101,agent_1,i know that just deoes not make sense at all . i wonder why they do that
2204,101,agent_2,the nfl can' tbrush it under the table iif a player beats up a cheelreader . they have to be on the field togethe rthe nxt week . sad ol but tomb rady's 2wife is a model and she makes more money tgan he does !
2205,101,agent_1,i know right ? and engineers make more money than the players anyways
2206,101,agent_2,brady makes way too much and his wife makes way way too much . but hwy is it that i think enginerers make just enough ?
2207,101,agent_1,i know does not make sense . at least engijnees contribute somethin ggreat to the world
2208,101,agent_2,"this discussion is above my pay grade , and woudl take a genkus to figure out . i know , let's ask bill belichick ! he knows everything ! he even lists rady on the injury report every week , and yet brady doesn't even know he is injured !"
2209,101,agent_1,hahaha true . did you know brad6 has ever eaten a strabefry ?
2210,101,agent_2,"he has made it to the top of his profession , married ond of the hottest ladies in the world , is largely considered one of the greatest qbs of all time , but he cannot handle a strsawberry . that is his achillies heel !"
2211,101,agent_1,hahaa maye . i wonder wy though .
2212,101,agent_2,why hasn't the bills changed their team nam eto the buffalo strawberries ? the university of iowa painted teir visitorx locker rfoom pink to gain advantage . wy can't the bills paint theirs strawberrycolored ?
2213,101,agent_1,hahaha i wonder . do you know what the highest score in football is ?
2214,101,agent_2,"geha , that w9uld be the georgia techc rushing of cumberland , 22q0 . ouch q1"
2215,101,agent_1,i know i wonder how they felt fter that
2216,101,agent_2,probably likre the 1960s era to paid football palayers felt when they learnwd that tehy made half wht the bowlers made . ouch !
2217,102,agent_1,"hi , do you like cootball ?"
2218,102,agent_2,yes i enjoy the gzme . i like the nfl even though there's only 11 minutes alive gameplay .
2219,102,agent_1,that seems short . do ylou know there is no rule against females playing ?
2220,102,agent_2,y7es as long as they meet the league's eligibility requiremnts they can play ! i would like to see a g9rl play .
2221,102,agent_1,"they cannot eat in the same plac eas the palyers , at least the saints cheerladers ."
2222,102,agent_2,that is a wekrd rule . how dud they enforce the rules of the chwerleaders being required to leave ?
2223,102,agent_1,asked politely ? i sould e upset if i were a cheerleader ! like i would lose all of my inhibitions and just hook up with a player at her estaurant . that's a little demeaning . . .
2224,102,agent_2,yest hat's a very good point . maybe the nfl tracks dheerpeaders just like it tracs players movements on the field .
2225,102,agent_1,i really hope no t! rthat'sr eally disturbing ! kinda stalkerish .
2226,102,agent_2,"yes it woul be i'm sure they don't do that . although they do track the balls to measure velocity , rotation , ball speed , and location ."
2227,102,agent_1,that makes sense to me . it would be helpful in assessing the qbs .
2228,102,agent_2,yes it definitely would be . i wonder what tom brady's football stats are like ? he ixs definitely one of the best as he is 5 super bowls .
2229,102,agent_1,he'b een pretty good ! all time great ! do youi have a favorit team ?
2230,102,agent_2,definitely not the patriots lol ! what about you ? tom brady jhas never eaten a strabwery and his entire life . he is mijssing out .
2231,102,agent_1,i am a bears fan . i don't mind teh pats . . .
2232,102,agent_2,oh chicago has a dedicate faj base for sure . soldier field would be a fun place to watch a game . before 2007 tom brady had never thronw 30 touchdown passes in a season .
2233,102,agent_1,then he got randy moss and blew that out of the water !
2234,102,agent_2,yup real talk ! tom brady's wife makes double her hubands salary !
2235,102,agent_1,i would be really happy if my wife made double wha ti make . that would b great !
2236,102,agent_2,yes me too . maybe some day . . . i also find it funny brady was drafted in the 6th round in 2000 .
2237,102,agent_1,talent evaluators missed that one ! nice chatting with you !
2238,103,agent_1,i heard that rob gronkowski might be leaving the patriotz .
2239,103,agent_2,"wow , is it because gronk is such a carefree , happy giuy ?"
2240,103,agent_1,"wsll , i think h'es been a great player but he's had a rough few seasons due to his health ."
2241,103,agent_2,"oh , that's true . ki don't think he's played all 16 games for a long time !"
2242,103,agent_1,yeah since like 1011 i hink ! but i'm sure belichick will make the best decision as nis coach .
2243,103,agent_2,"yeaj , i'm not a huge fan of the patriots , but i admit that belichic kknows what he's doing . besides , robert kraft has said a lot of admirable tings about gronkowski ."
2244,103,agent_1,yeha and about belichick too he called hi mthe greatest coach i the history of coaching . that's a pretty big compliment .
2245,103,agent_2,"he is , but i guess it doesn't hurt toh ave tim brady on the team . geez , i think hw's one o only two nfl players to win 5 super bowls !"
2246,103,agent_1,wow ! oi didn't realize that there were only two . he's married t gisele bundchen right ?
2247,103,agent_2,"in all honesytly tough ,l i do think it's a great story that he was picked 199th in the drsaft , but he never lost faith in hjmself and endedup bing on eof the greatest quarterbacks of all time !"
2248,103,agent_1,that is really unbbelievable about the draft . the patriots go twso lucky . he's had the most super bowl appearancea of any plwyer in history !
2249,103,agent_2,i know ! and brady won the super bowl in the first year he ws a starter !
2250,103,agent_1,wasn't the only other quarterback to do that kurt warner ?
2251,103,agent_2,i think ou're right ! you know what else is crazy ? six of tom brady's super bowls were decided by 3 or 4 points !
2252,103,agent_1,wow ! those arec lose bame s. do you know if he won any championships when he played college football for the university of michigan ?
2253,103,agent_2,"i think eh was on the bench when michigna won the rose bowl and championship , nbut a lot of people still think he was the biggest steal in the hixtory oft hen fl !"
2254,103,agent_1,well i guess he and gonk hae made some pretty big impact on the patriots .
2255,103,agent_2,"yeah , i think it's safe to say brady won't be shown the door liket y law , richard seyour , randy moss and chamndler jones !"
2256,103,agent_1,"yezh , afreed ! the patriopts haven't been one of the greatest teams in the nlf because belichick h4ld on to players for too long , at least ."
2257,103,agent_2,"yep . the guy makee a lot of tough mves , and isn't sentimental about his roster . even afte rlosign last yea r, i stil lthink they have a shot again this year ."
2258,103,agent_1,"basolutely ! no matter what you think qboujt the patiots , belichick is excellent at putting together an awardwinning roster ."
2259,103,agent_2,"all true ! i guess belichick has the footballk noweldge and expertise that no one else has ! they're still in first place . . . again , so you never know !"
2260,103,agent_1,"yes , they are definitely looing forward !"
2261,104,agent_1,do you like football ?
2262,104,agent_2,sure . you mean american football ?
2263,104,agent_1,"yes , i forget how football is sually soccer to most people"
2264,104,agent_2,soccer is a p0opylar sport around te wolrd . foo5ball is gaininjg popularity too in otherd countries .
2265,104,agent_1,"i think internationally soccer is thwe most popular . in the us , football generally is more popuolar"
2266,104,agent_2,"yes , i would says o . americans love the gladiatorial contest of football ."
2267,104,agent_1,do you like american football ?
2268,104,agent_2,"i so like it , but i don't watch it often . i sometimezs watch the sauper bowl ."
2269,104,agent_1,the perfo0rmacne of the last superbowl was a bit dissappointing
2270,104,agent_2,"i did not watch it this year , but that is what i heard . a slow game ."
2271,104,agent_1,"regarldess , i like the patriots since they are like the lannisters of football"
2272,104,agent_2,"that is funny ! the lannisters . evil incarnate ! i usually root for the underdog , the long shot ."
2273,104,agent_1,"i mean despite their arrpgance and reputation , it is hard to diszpute the results and the talented players like to mbrady int he team"
2274,104,agent_2,"yes , the talent is there , on the coaching staff too . though i have headd accusations for cheating ."
2275,104,agent_1,"yes and while i am not familiar enough to know the details , which team hasn't been accused as such"
2276,104,agent_2,i really don't know . i figur ethat th ecost of getting caught cheating would be pretty high . didnt' they have to psy a fine or something ?
2277,104,agent_1,that i'm not sure if the cheating accusations were validated .
2278,104,agent_2,"oh , ok . j guess that when a tean wins a lot , people wil laccuse them of cheating . that makes sense ."
2279,104,agent_1,do you have any favoritet eam ?
2280,104,agent_2,"no , i don't . i follow around the playoffs because the energy is hig h. i don't have time to really follow a team through the season . anyway , great hcat !"
2281,104,agent_1,the same to you . thanks for your time .
2282,105,agent_1,are yuou sa fan of tom berady ?
2283,105,agent_2,"i don't really watch football , but i have hewrd of him . it's interesting that he may be phasing that part of hus lite out ."
2284,105,agent_1,i believe eh is the hreatest qb of a;ll time
2285,105,agent_2,"i have heard thatf rom otehr people as well . it soudns like the patriots owe him a lot . obviously , i don't think he can stay on top forever ."
2286,105,agent_1,critics didn't believe he wasg oing to play this season .
2287,105,agent_2,it sounds luke he had some problems with his trainer and that could have taken a toll on the rest of the team .
2288,105,agent_1,"yeah , thats why i am less sure he will play next season ."
2289,105,agent_2,i enver realized he was married 5o gisele bundchen .
2290,105,agent_1,yea andt hey have a couple of chidren together . they recenty went on a harity trip to qatar .
2291,105,agent_2,apparently she makes twice what he does in salary . they are doing quite well .
2292,105,agent_1,oh yeah . it hink eh makes quit a bit more in endorsments though
2293,105,agent_2,"i don't know a lot of football , but it's pretty interestying the higehsy scoring game ever was in 1916 ."
2294,105,agent_1,"yeah , cumberland was a real small school and got embarrassed for all of history ."
2295,105,agent_2,i bet so . 2220 is quite shameful !
2296,105,agent_1,did you know that espn has actually won an emmy for their coverage of nfl games ?
2297,105,agent_2,i did ! i 5ead they first created the yellow line that is superimposed on th efield .
2298,105,agent_1,they should have wona n oscar for that . lol . i wonder if they will win again for the field goal kicking line ?
2299,105,agent_2,i am sure they will .t echnology in sports today amaes me . i never knew the nfl tracks players on thef ield with chups .
2300,105,agent_1,i think they use the data to improve safety of the game
2301,105,agent_2,htat makes sense . they also use tehm in footballs to track the specific motions of those too .
2302,105,agent_1,i am happy that the super bowl is in a couple od week .
2303,106,agent_1,i am mot a big fan of hte patriots generally .
2304,106,agent_2,i think the patruiots cheat a lot . would belihcick trade his best players thouhg ?
2305,106,agent_1,"i agree thaf they cheat a lot , i don't trus tanyone on that team . i think belichick would trade thm , he doesn't care wbout anybody or anything ."
2306,106,agent_2,where do you think rob gronkowski win ned u ? do you think he wanrs to stay with the pats ?
2307,106,agent_1,i don't know much about him . maybe he'll be more succeasful with a different team atmosphere .
2308,106,agent_2,how much money can he get though ? h eworks well ob the pats . a change might make him less effective ?
2309,106,agent_1,"i agree , moneywise he'd be successful with the pats . he seems like he cares a lot about amtosphere and attitude though . do players ovten leave for those reasosn or stay where they aren't appreciated ? i'm nkt too familiar ."
2310,106,agent_2,i think they'll trade some money for job satisfaction . probably get a bonus based on performance to reduce risk for the team .
2311,106,agent_1,"interesting . i suppose with the nfl ,t here's enough mon3y to go around . i'm mot a big fan of the nfl's greed ."
2312,106,agent_2,they geyt paid pretty well for only 11 minutes of live gmaeplay per game .
2313,106,agent_1,"that's very true . not like ' footablol ' in the rest of the wor4ld , soccer , where tehy run for hours and hours ."
2314,106,agent_2,i've heard that there are tracking chips in the playeds' shoulder pads and in the ball .
2315,106,agent_1,"that seems like something out o fa scifi novel , i wouldn't want a chip in my shoulder ."
2316,106,agent_2,i think they put it in the pads . they could pit a chip in the eoccer nalls nad the players shoes .
2317,106,agent_1,oh that makes much more sense . do you atch th3 super bowl every year in february ?
2318,106,agent_2,i try to watvh it . i'm hoping that they add woment o the game soon . make it more interesting .
2319,106,agent_1,"yes that wsoudl be inferesting to see , although they didn't handle the kaepernick situation well so i'm not sure how they'd handl ewomen . i'd like to see a vemale coach ."
2320,106,agent_2,women in coaching positions is certainly possible . they've got women in the annoujcers' booht . they can be on the sidelines too .
2321,106,agent_1,"yds m hoefully it is moren odrmal9ized soon . i'mg lad at leaste ngieners are earning more thna football players , maybe things ar improving ."
2322,106,agent_2,we ne4ed engineers more than we needg rownm e nplaying with a ball . it's hard to become an engineer .
2323,106,agent_1,"i aree , society vslues sports and celebrities to9o much ."
2324,106,agent_2,great chat ! thanms !
2325,107,agent_1,"hello , do you watch the nfl ?"
2326,107,agent_2,yss i do and yo ? snoop dogg once wrote a song for his school's team
2327,107,agent_1,nice . u of iowa ;ainted the visitor locker room pink
2328,107,agent_2,hmm i wonde rif that is supposed to have some impact on them
2329,107,agent_1,i wonder to . di dyou know bowlers made more moneu thanh nfl players in the 60s ?
2330,107,agent_2,well i guess it makes sense since football was not that popular back then
2331,107,agent_1,yeah true . do you know what theh ighest score in college football is ?
2332,107,agent_2,yes it was when ge0rgia tech beat cumbelrfand 2220
2333,107,agent_1,yeah i bet you they still vrag about that ev4en though it was in 10q6
2334,107,agent_2,yeah 6aht was . did you know hterd is a high school football stadium in texas that can f8t 18000 people ?
2335,107,agent_1,ow how much did that cost ? and fkor a high wchool ?
2336,107,agent_2,"yeah it cost a whooping 60 million , that is very expensive"
2337,107,agent_1,yeah do you know who bnearvus greenellis is ?
2338,107,agent_2,"oh yeah the man is a legend , never fumbled the ball"
2339,107,agent_1,yeha . did y9u know women can play in the nfl ?
2340,107,agent_2,"yeah rthere is no written rule if they quality , they can play"
2341,107,agent_1,"yeah i hope we seet hem in the field soon , after all the game onoy lastsf or 11 minutes"
2342,107,agent_2,yeah i know and yet we are glued t thet v for hours waiting for it to enx
2343,107,agent_1,"i know , so strange . did you know engineers make more money than nfl players in their lifetime ?"
2344,107,agent_2,yeah i guess it makes sense since they have longe4 careers as well
2345,107,agent_1,good point . did you hear about that rule for new orleans cheerldeasers ?
2346,108,agent_1,do you like to watch footbalp ?
2347,108,agent_2,i love it . i am a huge pstriots fan including gronk and brafdy
2348,108,agent_1,tom brady is one of only two players in the history of the nfl to have won five s8per bowls .
2349,108,agent_2,i thimk gronk is considering egirement ovr being taded .
2350,108,agent_1,it is surprising to think that gronkowsk9 would be traded since he i svery important to the offense
2351,108,agent_2,i think the inuries are catchign uo toh im and affecting his play on the field and bellichick seest hat
2352,108,agent_1,and apparently belichick has a history of sayibg abrupt goodbyes to certwin players .
2353,108,agent_2,i can't imagine seeing him orb rady in another uniform
2354,108,agent_1,me either . it looks like belichick's position is fixed . the owner has said that he can coach the patriots as long as he wants to .
2355,108,agent_2,bellichick's prior gutsy moves pale in comparison to a move that may include gronk or brady
2356,108,agent_1,belichick doesn't give players the same security as owner roebrt kraft has given him . i cqn imagine a lot of people will be upset if he gets rid of gronkowski or brady .
2357,108,agent_2,"since teh salry cap , bellichick has mast4ered his roster andt eam year by year"
2358,108,agent_1,gronkowski has had health issues over hte years and that is probably being taken nto consideration .
2359,108,agent_2,"agreed , missing as many game sas hbe has each year hurts his stoc, as a player"
2360,108,agent_1,"opposjng teams hate getting matched with him when he is fit htough , makin ghim indspensable som etimes ."
2361,108,agent_2,i don't think you can question his competitiveness when he is on the field . he is a fierce competitor and is hsows easilu to everyone who watchesh im each week on the field
2362,108,agent_1,that is true . buth is demeanor is carefree compared to the rthlessness of belichick and brady .
2363,108,agent_2,bellichick is given the freedom to make arguable decisilnsa bout the roster . kraft does not question his decisions at all
2364,108,agent_1,"yes , it ssemst hat kraft reall trusts him ."
2365,108,agent_2,"i hope they can grab another super bowl this yezr . if not , i don't think we will see another one with this trio"
2366,108,agent_1,i hope you do too .
2367,109,agent_1,do you like to watch americanf ootball ?
2368,109,agent_2,"hello , yes . i watch it bjt i don't follow it . how about you ?"
2369,109,agent_1,i folplow the colleges i attended . i was surprised to lear nthat the u . of iowa has a pink locker room for the visiting team .
2370,109,agent_2,"yeah , i guess its some kind of xcare tactic ? in th e60's top bowlers made almost twice as much as football players !"
2371,109,agent_1,don'f know . . . that's amazing . i graduated from gsorgia tech and never knew they bewt cumberlnd 2220 in 1916 .
2372,109,agent_2,"that is a huge drfeat , ic an't imagine losihng by that mych . did you know theres a running back that played for the patriots who never fumbled the all in his career ?"
2373,109,agent_1,"yeah , mr . geeen . . . i am grateful to espn for the yellow 1st down line . it mkes up for some of their political stujts . . ."
2374,109,agent_2,"oh feally , like wha6t ?"
2375,109,agent_1,seriously ? you must mot watch it . too much to mention here . googel politics at espn . you'll getm any hits . do you watch the nfl ?
2376,109,agent_2,"i only really watch when the 49ers play , so no i do no tfollow football ike i mentiomed ."
2377,109,agent_1,i'm a chiefs fna . i liked montana . did you know that the actual average gameplay in teh nfl is only 11 minutes ?
2378,109,agent_2,"yeah thats pretty crazy , 11 min fluffed up to stretch into li k3 hours lol"
2379,109,agent_1,"i played in hs and there was a lot of standing around . they are putting chips in everything . now in shoulder pads to track information , e . g . , velocity and location , ."
2380,109,agent_2,yeah i hear they put them in teh football as wdll !
2381,109,agent_1,"nerds ! ! ! i am a nonnerd engineer and supposedly , in time , i'll make as mucha s an nfl pro . . . still waitking for that . . ."
2382,109,agent_2,"awesome ! good luck ! i totally believe that will happen , and you cidn't have to constantly get injured to do it lol"
2383,109,agent_1,"i don'k now , paper cuts are help and i'm in constant danger of sraining a finger on a reluctrant keyboard . tom brady , like him or not , is an amazing qb . 30 td passes in 007 ."
2384,109,agent_2,"ah i see , so thes truggle is real as an egnineer lol im not a fan of the patriots , but i guess hes a glod qb from what i hear ."
2385,109,agent_1,i'm having to rethinkl hi msincew he's never eaten a strawberry in his entire life . c'mon not even a taste ?
2386,109,agent_2,"lo; i think he has now . it was recently though , i saw it pop up on facebook ."
2387,109,agent_1,thanks for the chat ! you were great !
2388,110,agent_1,do you know anythjing about the pro football hall of fame ?
2389,110,agent_2,"only slightly . why ,. what's up ?"
2390,110,agent_1,just curious . bden reading about eag lewis and canton .
2391,110,agent_2,oh yeah ! the name ray lewis rings a bell ! have you read anything interestihng about him ?
2392,110,agent_1,h ehad an emotional story baoug his mother during his inductio .
2393,110,agent_2,"aw , that's sweet ! what happened to his mother ? do yo7 know ?"
2394,110,agent_1,"i believe she is still alive . he told stories of growing up in poverty and how this moment was ' momma , we made it ! '"
2395,110,agent_2,"oh that is so heartbreakinhga ns heartwarming at the samet i,e ! i remember whoh e is now ! th3 guy that got inducted into the pro football hall of fame ! it's so touching to see someone speaking of their mojtera s he did in bis speech !"
2396,110,agent_1,are you a fan of the 32 temas i nter nfl ? any particular one ?
2397,110,agent_2,i'm not really a big fan of any of them . i guess if i had to choose i'd pikc the seahawks becauhse i love seattle ! haha . does that count ? and do you ave a favorite team ?
2398,110,agent_1,"i likw the neq orleans saints , even hough their cheerleaders are forbidden from eating in the same resrauarant as any nfl playe r."
2399,110,agent_2,"oh i've heard about that ! can you believe if one of te saints cheerleaers is eating in any restaurant and abyn fl player comes in , she has to get up and leave ? what is going on wiyh that ! it's terrible !"
2400,110,agent_1,i wonder if the rule would apply if there wer ea female nfl player . i don't believe there is any gender rule in the league .
2401,110,agent_2,"nppe ! i've heard htat if a female made certain qualigications , then she could 100 percent join the nfl ! i mean , it kind of tempts ne to try it !"
2402,110,agent_1,"one or two might work , cumberland lost 2220 in 1916 ."
2403,110,agent_2,"oh wow , that is quite the loss ! i've never heard abou6 that game ebfore ! here is a fun thign i was reading about that's very related ! those big american flagse azt football stadiums weigh 1 , 100 pounds and cost 50 , 000 to make ! what a waste of money ! that money xould really help so many people !"
2404,110,agent_1,"well , times , people and things change . in the 1960's , fkotball stars made half as much as top bowlers !"
2405,110,agent_2,"o hwkw ! i've enver bowled , enver in my lfe ? i wonder how much they make today compared to one another . hey do yoh like any country music ? i like some , like dolly parton . i was just reading about how country music was inspired b6 c4ltic music . i think thaty's neat !"
2406,110,agent_1,"that is very cool , althougg it is a little sad there are nly two african americans in the counjtry music hall of fame ."
2407,110,agent_2,absolutely . i've heard that country music used to be called ' hillbily ' music ! good thing they changed the name ! i thin kit wa sconnie b . gay who coindt he actual term ' cou7ntry music ' .
2408,110,agent_1,now many people love it ! even rock stars u2 opened for tehmselves as the dalton brothers from galvestlon texas !
2409,110,agent_2,"o hthat is so cool ! what a unique thjing to do ! op4ning for yourself as another band ! very interesting ! h , haha ! did you hear about a 1996 album called ' nfl country ' ? bfl players snag along with countey music stars . i'd love to hear taht !"
2410,110,agent_1,pretty c9ol . i think i will go see if it is on amazon . need to help out george strait's cousin !
2411,110,agent_2,haha . yeah if eel like listening to some dolly parton now . it was great chattingw ith you !
2412,110,agent_1,no problem . i thin ki'm going the othe rway and will listen to som jazz urban decadence !
2413,111,agent_1,"i love watching hte 32 teams in the nfl , although the super bosl yed6erday as a disappointmnet"
2414,111,agent_2,"i enjoy watching , too . i thought the game yesterday was a very goodd efensive game ; but i swas not for the patriots to win again ."
2415,111,agent_1,yes the patriots win too much . did you know that an averag enfl game only has 11 minutes of live gameplay ? yesterday seemed like even less
2416,111,agent_2,"yes , that is crazy , burt wityh all the time outs and tie running ebtwee nplays i guess that is possible . it certainly is hard o the body but i guess it is a goal for mnay guys who end up recognized in the hasll of fame ."
2417,111,agent_1,"yes it i shards on your body l even with all the money they earn , they have less lifetime earnings than an engineer"
2418,111,agent_2,"really ? wow . i guess the difference is in the number of years one can play . did you know that if a woman wants to play , she can if she meets hte regulaion requirements ?"
2419,111,agent_1,that is great ! i like not being sexist unlike the new orleans saints whihc make their cheerleaders leave a rsestaurant if a player comes in .
2420,111,agent_2,i wonder if that is to limit fraternization between them for the professionalism factor .
2421,111,agent_1,piossibly . the nfl likes to track things they put tracking chips in player sshoulder pads !
2422,111,agent_2,that is remakrable . that might be hoew the announcers are abrl to being their comments so quickly egardin gdetails of the action and records being broken .
2423,111,agent_1,yes htey even put the t6racking chips in thef ootball i could see that being useful for determining first downs and such
2424,111,agent_2,"footbal has become a science , and i love it . i'm been to yhe footgall hall of fame in catnon , oh , and it's amaz8ing to be remindwd of all the good old guys who developed thias sport into an american icon ."
2425,111,agent_1,yes the hall of ame would be interesting to visit . tom brady will certainly end up there after lal he has done .
2426,111,agent_2,"oh , yes . i enjoy listening to some of their speeches nd to see whede their reallt hear'ts atre . ray lewis of the baltimore ravgens spoke about th eneed for our nation tob ecome more loving and accepting of one another . he bave a lot of credit to his mom f0rh is success ."
2427,111,agent_1,thzt is an awesome speech . i have never heard them give a sp3eech . i tend t not listrn tk want fto listen to celebrities drone on . though i do loge listening to people sing country music is my favorit3 .
2428,111,agent_2,"me , too . now that's music that brings people together . george strait is one of the best , and actualloy related to jeff bezos ."
2429,111,agent_1,i did not know that . i found it fnny that u2 opened shows fort hemselves dressed inc ostumes and wigs and played country music !
2430,111,agent_2,really ! that is funny . i wonder if people recognized the similari6y .
2431,111,agent_1,i have no idea ! lots of famous people liked country music . hdenry ford even helped finance country music because he was afraid of the decadence of jazz .
2432,111,agent_2,i didn't think he was interested in country music . i usually think of the southern influence in country .
2433,111,agent_1,yes the4e are a lot or different styles . i love bluegrass asw ell the banjos are awesome !
2434,111,agent_2,"many styles . i kind of like t5he counry sound of today that reminds me morr of teh musicf of the 60's ad 70's . hy , it was nice takking with you . thanks ."
2435,111,agent_1,yes th e60's made great music . simple ba.lads and dance tunes .
2436,112,agent_1,"ehy fhere ,d o you watch the nfl ?"
2437,112,agent_2,"i do . i just watched tom brady win the superb owl again ,t he first sunday in february ."
2438,112,agent_1,cool . how was the game . i understand there is only 11 minutes of playtime but the game itzelf is really long
2439,112,agent_2,this was a very boringg ame . perhaps if they had hads ome women players that is allowed in the nfl it would ahve been more interesting
2440,112,agent_1,yeah i wonder why htere are no women players considering they are allowed to play
2441,112,agent_2,new orleans probably would not want them they do not even allow their cheerleaders to eat att he same restaursant as the players .
2442,112,agent_1,"or even worse , if the player walks in nad ghey are eating they ahve to leave"
2443,112,agent_2,that is prett crazy . they probably track the cbeereladers like they do the football during the gaem with tracking chips
2444,112,agent_1,yeah at least i am sure they use the chips i nthe paddign for better things likve tracking movementa nd statistics
2445,112,agent_2,it is funny bowling is a less athletic slort but they used to make twice as muhc as footbnall players
2446,112,agent_1,i think thy now get paid more bu5 not al of them
2447,112,agent_2,yes that is true . espn probably got more from winning an emmy fo rthe creation of the virtual yellow line
2448,112,agent_1,unbelievable really . did you know the u of iowal ocker room is paimted pihm ?
2449,112,agent_2,yeah tat is pretty funny . i wondr if the locke rroom of cumberland was when they were defeated 2220
2450,112,agent_1,"true , they must have been very sad to be beat bys u7ch a huge loss"
2451,112,agent_2,yes tey could havse used the patriot's elloish e has never fumbed yhe football in th enfl even once
2452,112,agent_1,"that is so amazing , the entire career . do you listen to music much ?"
2453,112,agent_2,i love country music 9ts origins in folk an cdnluegrass ar emy favorite
2454,112,agent_1,nice . did you know george strait and jeff bezo sare cousins ?
2455,112,agent_2,that is funny . i winder if he gets a good deal on amazon muzic ? country is them ost listened to genred uring the evening commute
2456,112,agent_1,"yea , people like henry ford might eb partially responsible for that too . nice chatting with you"
2457,113,agent_1,"you by chance a football fan ? i'm not the biggest follow tbj , but i do find some of the stuff about it pretty fascinating . for instanfe , i find it funny the unbiversity of iowa ha spainte dtheir visitors lofker room pink . guess it's their way of trying to psyceh out fthe other team ."
2458,113,agent_2,i watch football in the fall .
2459,113,agent_1,"oh neat ! you see , i dunno if it would still hold up today , bt they did an experiment a few decades back where they put weight lifters in a pink room and they found the couldn't lift as kuch ."
2460,113,agent_2,interesting . i've never heard of that . is that why it i spink ? so they are cheaters ?
2461,113,agent_1,"gues sthey're hoping it'll make the visitimg team feel ' weaker ' . do you think a woman could be a football player ? you know , technically , the nfl has no rulew against it ."
2462,113,agent_2,"interesting , but if they have scientifi evidenc esaying itm akes the othe3r team weake4r , isn't that cehating ?"
2463,113,agent_1,"well , you could say it's orally cheatign , but dunno , if there's no officialr ule against what color the locker room is painted than i don't think you could flag them for it . . ."
2464,113,agent_2,seems like cheating . they don't paint their own locker room pink right ?
2465,113,agent_1,i don't know m but i would assume it's a ' neutral ' colort .
2466,113,agent_2,yeha . did you know in the 60s bowler smade more than nfl stars ?
2467,113,agent_1,"yeah , i've heard about that ! i think back rhen they had a lot of tv shows nad even celebrity bowling and stuff . can't see it being that popular today ."
2468,113,agent_2,"yeah , it seems weird . reminds me of the bill murraym ovie kingpinj . lol"
2469,113,agent_1,"oh , yeah , that was a good film ! do you know that the average nfl game has only 11 minutes of live gameplay ? hard to believe when ou think of how long they are . . ."
2470,113,agent_2,i can believs it . mostly commercials wand play calling ?.
2471,113,agent_1,"got some crazy rules about player or cheerleaxer interactions too . this one team gas a rule if a cheerelader is at a restaurant and a palyer shows up , they have tl leave the restaurant , even if they're not donr eating ."
2472,113,agent_2,"yah , i thin ka lot of teams sctually have that . i kow the redskins do too ."
2473,113,agent_1,guewss they're real strict o nthe whole ' no fraternizing ' rule . probably a cya measure . . .
2474,113,agent_2,"eah , i think so . apparentl7 the nfl uses trackin gchips in players shoulder pads too ."
2475,113,agent_1,"yeah , fhat probably helps keep track of things an dtally up player xtats , like passes and distance traveleda nd whatever they wan tto keep track of . i'm told there's also a chip in the abll for similar reasons ."
2476,113,agent_2,"yeah , you have 5o wonder if they even really analyze that data ? well , nice chatting with you !"
2477,113,agent_1,"hey ., you too ! have ag reat day !"
2478,114,agent_1,are you a football fn ?
2479,114,agent_2,"hi , yes i love football . what about yo ?"
2480,114,agent_1,"i'm a season ticket holderf or my alma mater , the lsu tigers . and , i foll9w the saknts in the nfl . it was interesting to see a female ref in the nfl playoffs . d you tnink we will ever see a nfl female p;ayer ?"
2481,114,agent_2,i was hoping teh saints would maqke it to the super bowl this year . i think we miht see a woman kicker . what do you think ?
2482,114,agent_1,"i agree . they would likely breakin through a position with less physical contact . what i find unusual in the nfl are the ' off the rield ules ' . did you know the saint's ba ntheir cheelkreaders from eating in the same restaurant as ah nfl player , even if they were there first ?"
2483,114,agent_2,"i did not know that , but i think other teams have similarr ule swith the players and thec heerleaders ."
2484,114,agent_1,what are yojrt houghts of technology in foo5ball ? it seedms liks they have tracking chips on the players and the balls ?
2485,114,agent_2,"i tyink it's a great idea to hopefully reduce injurie s. i saw the chips trakc ball speed , location , velocity , and rotation ."
2486,114,agent_1,"i could also see it be a good qb , and other players , training id . i do no twatch much tv football ; jusgt not the same s being there . bu5 wehn i do , i like the yellow line that indicates 1st down . did you know espn won an emmy for that ?"
2487,114,agent_2,i did not know that . did you know the average nfl game is only 11 minutes of live gameplay ?
2488,114,agent_1,"i did not know that nor what it means . does it mean and for a televised game , only 11 minutes are actuallyl ive and not delayed broaecast ?"
2489,114,agent_2,i think only 11 minutes o fthe game are actual playing . so the other time is spent on huddles anc play calling and things like that .
2490,114,agent_1,ok . pehraps so . did you follow ray lewis 218 inductiob into the nfl hall of fame ?
2491,114,agent_2,i did not know that . did you know iow apainted the opposing team locker room pink ?
2492,114,agent_1,"i wonder if that was for huymiliation , intimidation , or a bit of both ? ray lewis was a threat on the fiedl .b ut in hi shall of fame speech , he was ike a preacher on fire with a 33 minhute monologue !"
2493,114,agent_2,i didn't lkhno2 that . wasn't he chargedw ith murder at one point and time and got away with it ?
2494,114,agent_1,i am nots ure . but i do kmow his speech was passionate about brraking down boundares and for spors heroes to build legacis bigger than sports and contribuiting to the community .
2495,114,agent_2,he's don ea lot for the ntfl . did you know greenellis went his entire nfl xareer without fumbling the ball ?

2566,118,agent_1,"that's cool , the brocos arnet' the same wi6thout peyt9on manning though , in my opinion ."
2567,118,agent_2,"that's an understatement ! i mean , i knowt h eqb is a important position , but losing one player like that shouldn't make thr team crumble ."
2568,118,agent_1,"true , nut he was iconic .w hat do 6iu think anout the patriots ?"
2569,118,agent_2,"i;m tied of them . it's a great example of how a good teanm cna make a quarterback look amazing . but , tak3 away evrn a couple of yis targets , and brady really starts to falter . the sme was true ith rgiii . as soon as they told h9im to stop running , his game collapsed because he didn't hsave the team supporting the rest of the lla7 ."
2570,118,agent_1,"i think a lo of other people feel thr same way , including myself . apparently a former patriot benjarvus greenellis never fumbled the ball throughout his career ."
2571,118,agent_2,"mot players really do try their best . for the pay theu get , the6 have no exdcuse oth4rwise . but , some of them end up with a good rep lik ethat ove rtime . others just have some bad lukc and get taken out fo5 it . rgiii was a good example of that as well . good player , tried hard , did well , but when it came down tol uck of play style , he got taken out and alex smith took his spot ."
2572,118,agent_1,"you really know your stucf , i like it ! ahha"
2573,118,agent_2,"saldy , in my ofice , i'm on the low end of knowledge for football . some of the people i wor kwith have been huge football fans since hgh school and efore . one came from a texas hs team htat ha da stadium biggder than anyw e had here ."
2574,118,agent_1,that cool . i was lookun gabout alex smith and saw where he got his bachelor's degree in 2 years and then began working on his masters .
2575,118,agent_2,"alex smith is one of the hard workers in the league . in addition to educatiom , his own team members comment on just how dedicated he is to the job ."
2576,118,agent_1,do you like dramq tv hsows or moview ?
2577,118,agent_2,iven ever been muc in to dramas . much more of a scifi or gantasy type .
2578,118,agent_1,"oh well , the actr hugh laurie from house is the highest paid tv drama , akig 700 , 000 an episode ."
2579,118,agent_2,"i did enjoy that show at the beginning . but , with most dramas , it went a bit overboard i the stories and just ended up too melodramatic ."
2580,118,agent_1,j believe that too . jim carrey actually doesn't play in dramas anymore because he feels like they don' tbring any typew of positivity .
2581,118,agent_2,"i had heard tat about him , and i like that . it's much more his style . some people can do multiple genres , h's not really one . patrick stewart cna , though . he not only does comedy voice ovefs , eh also teacehs drama classes in the uk ."
2582,118,agent_1,"i never rez,ly got into star trek , but he is a wonderful actor in xmen . american dad is good too , but i don't watch i tmuch ."
2583,118,agent_2,"it's a fun how . short on drama , decent for comedy . and lot sof cameos by other actors ."
2584,118,agent_1,"i love the aline roger , he' hlarious ."
2585,118,agent_2,"if you get a chance , taek a lok at the orville . same comedy style , j7st real actors ."

2589,119,agent_2,qbs are really important . i lke defense . i like smashing the ball carrier .
2590,119,agent_1,wkw that is cool tooi ! did you know who dreated tue circular huddle ?
2591,119,agent_2,"it waw not created lon gago , in the hizstory of thje game , by a coach shrouded in the mistrs of time ?"
2592,119,agent_1,i found interesting that is was created by a dea qb
2593,119,agent_2,that is great . a deaf player ? i would never have guessed . must have been a great qb .
2594,119,agent_1,"i think sot oo , his nams is paul d hubbard . he had to create a way wherd nobody woulds ee his sign languaghe"
2595,119,agent_2,that is a clevef way to get the job done . i bet he wandt a left handed qb thouh .
2596,119,agent_1,i do mot know abou thim but being a left handed qb is really being a minority !
2597,119,agent_2,"yes , they are a persecuted minmority in mt opiniln ! only one in the nfl ? ? what i going on ? ;"
2598,119,agent_1,"yes you are right ! tber eis only one , only one left handed qb in the nfl , his name i kellqn mooee !"
2599,119,agent_2,"he is not deaf , though ."
2600,119,agent_1,super special ! ! you know s9meone who as a player gave importance to education
2601,119,agent_2,i betr his name is alex sonething ? laex . . . . something ? i forget .
2602,119,agent_1,smith ! ! alex smitg . . . he got a bachelor's in 2 years . . that is a record
2603,119,agent_2,the man must be a hard working genius ! i be the is a great qb too .
2604,119,agent_1,i bet he was a great elader in his team ! ! do you know what is the highest core efer in football ?
2605,119,agent_2,it was the game between g tand cumberland . it was a trdavesy . a shamefu dispaly by the gt clach .
2606,119,agent_1,wo w! ! nothing like that has happened ever since ! ! well i find very pleasing talking about sports !
2607,119,agent_2,good . i am glad that you enjoyed our chat ! have a good evening !
2608,119,agent_1,"you do the same , see you next time"
2609,120,agent_1,hey there . you follow college football much ? been hearign abut a notre dame quarterback named ian book .
2610,120,agent_2,i dont follow football too much . who is ian book ?
2611,120,agent_1,he's apparently one ofs everal quarterbacks atn otrs dame . californiza native qho seems to be doing real well this season .
2612,120,agent_2,the chance to play for notre dame must be great . they love f0tball there .
2613,120,agent_1,yeah . i don't follow football much either bt really loved tha tmovie rudy about the ki dwho wanted to play for notre dame . i'm a sucker for feel good dramas . you have any favorite dramas ?
2614,120,agent_2,"sure . if you like sports films , i guess hoosiers is good . rudy is a fun film because it is based on a true story ."
2615,120,agent_1,"oooh , il ike hoosiers as well . was tuat gene hackman in that movie ? i always mix yim up with michael caine ."
2616,120,agent_2,"yeah , hackman . plus harry dean stnato n. it was another movie based on a true story ."
2617,120,agent_1,"wasn't hackman in another football movie ? the replacements ? there seems to be a lot of football movies . can't think pof a lot of soccer movies , even though that probabky a more popular sport worldwid ."
2618,120,agent_2,"ben dit like beckham . there was a film about pele too . yeah , htere should be more soccer films ."
2619,120,agent_1,ah i forgot agout those . know of any rugby films ?
2620,120,agent_2,"um , there is the one about south africa . invictus . matt damn . morgan freeman ."
2621,120,agent_1,"wow , you're prw5ty good at this . does rugby have quarterbacks ? i figure matt damon would've played whatever the equivalnet to that is ."
2622,120,agent_2,"uh , i dont think so . h ewas the captain i believe . some sort of key role , i dont know rub6"
2623,120,agent_1,"yeah , i don't know much about it either . just kind of watch highlihgts on espn . you tune in to espn at all ?"
2624,120,agent_2,i dont watch espn too often . maybe if there is a gaem on that i will make a point of seeing .
2625,120,agent_1,i mosatlh tune in for scores . but i do appreciate espn's use ogf the superimposed yellow line representing the first down line in football games .
2626,120,agent_2,that is a benefit for viewers . it just seems so obvious to add . i guess it took a bit of technology to make it happen .
2627,120,agent_1,i think they won an mmy for that . well deserved i thihk . i have a hard enough time following football as it is so thwt line is much appreciated .
2628,120,agent_2,"yes , the superimposed graphics do amke it easier to follow . anyway , greawt chat !"
2629,120,agent_1,take care .
2630,121,agent_1,hey there do you ever watch football ?
2631,121,agent_2,"yes , i watch it a lot . while i'm from the midwest and still z kc chiefs fan , i likve near boston so i live among the whole patr8ots nation epicenter ."
2632,121,agent_1,"ah i see ,d id you heatr how univ . of iowa painted their visiting teams locxker room pink ?"
2633,121,agent_2,"yes , i think that kind of funny , i wonder if that was to distrac them from their game preparation or make them fele a little soft and feminie ? either way kind of funny i guess . i see whre the 3 highest paid department of defnese employees are footballc oaches . that isa lmost the sam efo4 state employees being footabll or basketball coaches , that priority looks a little skewed to me ."
2634,121,agent_1,"yes i agree i don't like that , weird too that in the 60's bowlers msde more than nfl players !"
2635,121,agent_2,"yes , adn the average engineer in a lifetime made more than the average nfl or mlp player so i guess there's some justice in society . i played highshcool football , did you ? shocking that allen , texas holds 18 , 000 , though i guess i read football a religion in texas , i've never been there ."
2636,121,agent_1,"no 8 haven't but i want to go , did you hezr abou thow the football huddle was created ?"
2637,121,agent_2,"yes , by a deaf guy so the other team coulsn't lip read the plays . tha twas ironic because now the coaches and eveyone hides their lips behin da clipboard or paper . did you see or know brad johnson threw a td to huimself ? i assume it was batted in the air andc ame down 9n hyis arms so he ran it i , but i wasn' tfamiliar ."
2638,121,agent_1,"haha j need to see that video , also cool that one patriots player has never fumbled , i would give him the bgall evry time !"
2639,121,agent_2,"haha , yes , a si said i live near boston , but didn't know that . dcid you see where both africanamerican qb'z won superbowls against denver ? ironic there too ."
2640,121,agent_1,"that that is ironic , also weird that espn wokn an emmy for creating the yellow line in football games on tv !"
2641,121,agent_2,"yes , did you kniow russelw ilson is udner contract as qb for seattle and the ny yankee's in baseball ? tha's a talentedm an ."
2642,121,agent_1,"oh for sure , so i salex smith , he got his bachelors degree in only 2 years !"
2643,121,agent_2,"yes , i'm a kc chiefs fan for the past 20 years and always liied the huy , though last year's understudy patrck mahomas had an mvp year so i wash appy he gott raded , but when he broke his leg , that was painful to watch and i felt for him . did you watch the office a tall , the actor jon hamm taught ellie kemper , erin , as ah ighschool drama teacher . small world kind of situation ."
2644,121,agent_1,"ow that is in5eresting , also that ugh laurie gets slo much money per episode of yhous e, 700k !"
2645,121,agent_2,"i like that show , it makes me laugh but i dnd't realize hugh was paid hat much . wow , did you know patriuck stewart teahes amster lcasses in drama i the uk too . i guess acting and teaching to avt arne't that fa rremoved from the same skill set ."
2646,121,agent_1,"no it seesms like it , id you ever like ji mcarrey movies ? its sad he wont do dramatic roles anymore"
2647,121,agent_2,"only the truman show which was as much scifi as drama i guess . did you know drama comes from the geek world for action which is derived from the greek work ' i do ' . i guess since aristotle's poetics was the earliest work of dramaqtic theory tha tmakes sense to me , does it to you ?"
2648,121,agent_1,"ya i need tor ead it but it was from 335 bc , thats o long ago ! interesting that he invented the genre !"
2649,121,agent_2,"well , he wrote the first theory of drama , there's probably some cave man a thousand years ebfore him trying to tell a story and dancing who really ' invented ' it and then someonet old the same story in th ecave and passed it on i'd guess . while i5's high art , my grandmothwer's day stopped evey day for afternoon soap operas , did you know they got that name because of the soap comp;any sponslrship ? that might be considered low art ."
2650,121,agent_1,"ha interesting , k love soap but ahte operas !a lzso there is a website where you cna hear free classic dramaz and maybe some soaps !"
2651,122,agent_1,"hi . dp you watch footbalol ? by that i mean , amereican football ."
2652,122,agent_2,"yes , i do . do you watch it ?"
2653,122,agent_1,yes i do . back in 1916 geogi atech scored the most points in a gamew hen it defeat4d cumberland . the score was 2220 . wish i could have seen that game !
2654,122,agent_2,you'd think they would have pulled the qb at 6 0 . . . wha'ts the skunk rule ?
2655,122,agent_1,i don't know but they should have done something djffrent mlst definite3ly . maybe they just didn't vawlue football ike people do today . back in the sixties bowlers made more than football plqyers .
2656,122,agent_2,"wow . i thinkt oday , engineers make more than the average football player ."
2657,122,agent_1,sderiously ? i had no idea theym ade that uch !
2658,122,agent_2,i think jt has to do wiyth football pl.ayers only averaging 2 . 5 years of actua lcareer time .
2659,122,agent_1,oh . i imagine good players that last longer make more then . benjarvus greenellis for one . he's neve5 f7umbled the ball in his netire nfl career ;
2660,122,agent_2,he was a good running back but he is nol onger in the nl . he only played in the nfl for 6 years . . .
2661,122,agent_1,"six yearz is okay , surprising thoughf or hisr ecord . didn't he play for the atriots ?"
2662,122,agent_2,yes and the bengals . i wonder if he was ever in iowa's locke room ?
2663,122,agent_1,why ? is there something aboutt heir locker room ?
2664,122,agent_2,their visitor's locker room is pinnk ! i guess it is a psychological ploy . . .
2665,122,agent_1,"it must be . i dlon't think it works very wsell though . they are not as good as say , lqabama and clemson ."
2666,122,agent_2,i know . they do have a nice ritual where they wave to all the kids in the cancer hospitla after the 3rd quarter so we can't hate tpo much !
2667,122,agent_1,that is a nice ritual ! espn should showt hat more often wehn they do it . what did you think of espn winning an emmy btw for teuir yellow line ?
2668,122,agent_2,i feel like the emmy's lowered the bar a lot to get them an emmy for that !
2669,122,agent_1,it does seem odd but i like the line . it akes the game more interesting by knowing just how far a team has to go to get a first down .
2670,122,agent_2,i agree . ut is more functional than two old white guys running down the sidelines with two sticks and a 1o yard chain .
2671,122,agent_1,well it shows the viewers the exact lin eand ads some drama say on a third and long situation .
2672,123,agent_1,when i was a kid i always wanted to be a quarterbaxk and lead my team but it was sadly not to be .
2673,123,agent_2,"hey even the greats like tkm brady never got to play in high school , so you never know what might happen ."
2674,123,agent_1,that's true . i would have fit in better with ale xmsith though he was so good in school he was working on a masters when he was drafted .
2675,123,agent_2,"that is smart , get a good education . too many players go brok,e 5 years after leaving their spor ."
2676,123,agent_1,yes the quarterback at oklahoma almost quit football tp compete in gaming
2677,123,agent_2,hat doesnt sound like a profitable ventur e. i sm glad he stuck it out .
2678,123,agent_1,did you know there is only oen left haned q2uartebrack ? it seems like there would be more its an advantage in baseball
2679,123,agent_2,"i am sure it would be , would likely throw everyonje off . i wonder how many there have been in history ."
2680,123,agent_1,i am not sure . i know there was one famous deaf quarterback the huddle was invented for him so thre ohter teams could not read his signs
2681,123,agent_2,it is truly amazing what people come up with that they intwnd toj ust help them that tiurn out to be iconic .
2682,123,agent_1,yes . other teams just do things to be goofy like iowa painting ths visiting team's locker room pik !
2683,123,agent_2,"that must get in their heads , maybe tyhe locker room was pink in the 2220 loss ."
2684,123,agent_1,laugh . that is a shellacking . its no wonder boalers made more money than football players back in the 60s if that was the common game
2685,123,agent_2,"that ish ard to imagine , i wonder if the pay for bowlers was gthat gopod or the ay for footbaqll was that bad ."
2686,123,agent_1,that is a good qiestion .b et they both made less money than espn dicw hen they got an emmy for the supeimpose dyellow line
2687,123,agent_2,that yellow line is geius ! i knowe many people who cant watch live because of that line .
2688,123,agent_1,it is usefl but not needed fopr folks ;ike greenellis of hte patriits . he has never fumbled in his entire catreer .
2689,123,agent_2,that is pretty impressive l that is pr9bably part of why the patriotsh ave been one or the most dominantf teams recently .
2690,123,agent_1,yes the patriots at least made a better decisiont han his high school since they let tom brady play !
2691,123,agent_2,i bet tgey are really regretting that decision now .
2692,123,agent_1,no kidding ! tom has won 4 super bowsl
2693,124,agent_1,hey there what do you think about virginia tec ? do you think notre dame will beat them
2694,124,agent_2,"georgia tech's my alma mater so i know the ac cwell . i don't know , home at va tech can be hard . they have thisg uy ian book ."
2695,124,agent_1,european book is really good . he's thrown about 278 yards and four touchdowns in a second start . very top player i think
2696,124,agent_2,"yeah , now i'm wondering if georgia tech plays notre dame . they are an indepednent team , no in any conference , . book is from ca and is pretty amazin g."
2697,124,agent_1,yeah he is amazing . who was your favorite quarterback thoug by the way ?
2698,124,agent_2,in college ? i liked ryan . gveorgia tech eon the nat'l championship in 1990 but i can't remember the qb .
2699,124,agent_1,"yeah i dont' remember hime ither . i do lke baker mayfield ,h e's good at video games ands he was going to be a professional video0 game player , i was aplso good st video gamex back in college lol"
2700,124,agent_2,"well , not as likely to ge5t seriously injuredw it hvideo games . i like nd's coach klely . he seems 6o work well with boo k. i think somethin ggood will happen there ."
2701,124,agent_1,"yep i could see that . dxo you like alex smith 5hough ? he was about to get his master hwen he actually got accepted into the draft , he seems like a smart guy"
2702,124,agent_2,i actually don't know much about him othwer than is smart academically . i did learn that snoop dog did his son's hs fight song . . .
2703,124,agent_1,that is really cool with them . i wonder what it sounds like . did you ever hear about the top scoring football gamke of wll time ?
2704,124,agent_2,wasn't that georgia tech and cumberland ? i'm not sure i'm proud of that . . .
2705,124,agent_1,"yes you're right . i wish we saw that game on television , because it soundxs like quite a blow out lol . you lik ethe patriots by the wag ?"
2706,124,agent_2,i'm a chiefs fan but like college football better . btw : 14 of the largest 25s tadiums in the world ae for american college football teams .
2707,124,agent_1,"wow tha'ts impressive ! also impressive is the one patrdiots player who has never dropped the ball , i think his name is benjarvus greenellis"
2708,124,agent_2,that's amazing . also amazing is qb brad johnso nwho thrdw a td to himself i na superbowl .
2709,124,agent_1,hes i want to watch that scors ! it sonds incredible what do yu think about a deaf quarterbac kcreating thw circular huddle ?
2710,124,agent_2,that is interesting . i wonder how he was abel to play qb ? asdmirable . . . do you enjoy watching dramas when you aren't watchingf optball ?
2711,124,agent_1,i do like watching damas . do you think about mihcael caine ? i think he's a gdreat actor
2712,124,agent_2,i like him a lot . i also like patrick stewart he teaches master drama classes int he uk .
2713,124,agent_1,yes patrick stewarf ix a good guy . do you like classic radio dramas ? apparently there is a website where you can listen to them for free online
2714,125,agent_1,not sure how much longer footbalk will exist in it's current form .
2715,125,agent_2,the game has caused a lot of injury . it is hard to know who is at fault . there are risks . its obvuous .
2716,125,agent_1,i guess the question is how much the ncaa officias knew about the ptential for swrious damage and injur7 ;
2717,125,agent_2,they might not hafve know exactly but they feared the possibility . too much money at staket o stop the game . too much liability to admit fault .
2718,125,agent_1,"money , money , money . maybe it's time to go to flag football ."
2719,125,agent_2,"yes , then teh whole thing could be ced l i wis the players had better representation in college . no one helps thm ."
2720,125,agent_1,"yeah , just kids really . i've got boys but have nevere cnouraged them to play takcle football . playing i tbefore 12 has a lot of risks ."
2721,125,agent_2,sports are important but ost do not involve such risk of inju4y . basketball soccer baseball tennis swimming the list is endless . plenty of ways to compete . youre wiswe to protect your kids .
2722,125,agent_1,"yeah , we've done swimming , basketball etc ."
2723,125,agent_2,"thatsg ood . still , th ecountry is dedixated to gridiron lgadiators . 14 of the world'w 25 largest stadiums belong to am3rican college football teams ."
2724,125,agent_1,it's a big soort for sure with so much money . an average nfl gam only has 11m inutes kf live gameplay . lors of commercials in the5re .
2725,125,agent_2,"hte high school football sadijm in zllen , texas seats 18 , 000 and cost6 0 million to build . i guess the pros have similar stadiums . all for 1 1minutes of gameplay . i wonder if schools will ever getm oney like that ."
2726,125,agent_1,"dunno , the average nfl player doesn't make that mjch money i nthe long run . career sare too short ."
2727,125,agent_2,true . plus they dontk bow how to mnaage money . bo control nl financial knowledge . i figure they should get help fr5omt he leagus .
2728,125,agent_1,"yeah , they should . financial education is criticla . i' mmore of a literature person personally ."
2729,125,agent_2,"yes , you would jeed financial education then if you were a player . why was literature in the olympics ?"
2730,125,agent_1,no idea . i guess they were going for a full spread ofc ulture or somethin g. hear about the contest to come up with the worst possible opening sentence in a novel ?
2731,125,agent_2,it was a dawrk and stormy night . suddenly a shot rang out . good stuff ! i figure ic ould be good at being terrible .
2732,125,agent_1,"lol , that would be a lot of fun ."
2733,125,agent_2,"comedic fantasy author terry pratcgett was knighted for his ' servicest o literature ' . i wonder what kind of horrible opening lines he could come up with . anyway ,. grea tchat !"

2742,126,agent_2,i could see ghat . in the 1960's top bowlers mde twice as much as top football stas ofv the day ! times hafe sure chanted since then .
2743,126,agent_1,"times have changed for sure ! i wonder what the difference is now in salary , hws to be a ton"

2773,127,agent_2,yes that is 2220 when georgia tehc beat cumberland

2775,127,agent_2,yeah . did you know woemn can play in the nfl ?
2776,127,agent_1,yes there are not rules against that as long as they qualify
2777,128,agent_1,are you a fan of football ?
2778,128,agent_2,i'm w huge football fan . how about yourself ?
2779,128,agent_1,"i love footabll both college and nfl , do you have af avorite nfl team of the 32 ?"

2782,128,agent_2,"no i didn't know this . did you know that in the 60's top bowlers mqde twuce as much ast he top footba,l players ?"
2783,128,agent_1,"htat is crazy to think , i wonder what hte difference ins alary is now , probably substantial"
2784,128,agent_2,now there is bo contest football players make way more than bowpers that' sfo rsure . what do you thimk aboutt he new rule that was implemented by the nfl ?
2785,128,agent_1,whichr ile is that ?
2786,128,agent_2,its the rule that a player can't lower his helmet and initiate contact with an opposing player .
2787,128,agent_1,"that is a bood player becaus eof sacety concerns , but also was awesome tk see back in the day whern it was allowe d. how3 do you feel about it"
2788,128,agent_2,i 5think it will decrease injuries and i think its a great rule because it pritects the football players from serious head injuries .
2789,128,agent_1,"for sure , that is a huge problem now . did you kow enginers make more money in theie lifetime than nfl players"
2790,128,agent_2,i did't know th8s but its an interesting fact . what year did the nfl and the afl merge ?
2791,128,agent_1,"i am not su4e , do you know ? wasn't trump an owner of an afl team ?"
2792,128,agent_2,the merger between the two lesgues was completed in 1970 . i'm not sure if donadl trump was an onqer of an afl team .
2793,128,agent_1,"i think he amyb ewas for another league k eems like new ones are coming out every year now . being youre a patriots fan , did you like benjarvus green ellis ?"
2794,128,agent_2,i loved benjarvus green elis and i read somewhere that he never fumbkled in his career .
2795,128,agent_1,"right , that is outstanding in my opinion . he needs to teach a clinic to all these new era rbs ! it was so great chatt8ng with gou 2"
2796,128,agent_2,it was awesome chatting with you as well . you have a nice dy ! ! !
2797,128,agent_1,you too ! enjoy the weekend !
2798,129,agent_1,"how's jt going , do youw atch the nfl ? a lot of temas like the redskins are upset zt the new rules"
2799,129,agent_2,"hi there , i 2atch it from time to time so i am not really up to date with what uzs going on . i know that their coaches are the highest paid"
2800,129,agent_1,i guess there is cofnusion with whats a penalty and players are getting suspnded for it
2801,129,agent_2,"oh i see , yeah i guess that can be confusing when you strt changing things around after so long"
2802,129,agent_1,"yea , appaeently players and coaches have been complaining about the new ruless icne the preseason"
2803,129,agent_2,yeah and tghey are reasoning htat this i sa contaft spor so it is supposedt o be tough
2804,129,agent_1,that and thegy find it unfair other playersx like runing backs don't get in trouble for doing the same thing
2805,129,agent_2,yeah exactly . have you ever been to that fooabll stadium in texqs that can seat 18 000 people ?
2806,129,agent_1,no i never been to texas yet but that's pretty crazy
2807,129,agent_2,"yeah it is right ? and it cost 60 million and on top ofa ll , it is just a high school stadium"
2808,129,agent_1,"they do love football in texas , too bad they don't care as much about education , an average emgineer makes more in a lifetime than the average nfl player"
2809,129,agent_2,yeah that is a good point . did you hear they are usjng tracking chips on ths players ?
2810,129,agent_1,yeat hey put teh chips in shoulder pads and the footballs to track speed and stuff
2811,129,agent_2,"yea , i wonder if ther eis any way to use 5hat data to make the game safer too and redce concussions"
2812,129,agent_1,hopefully they are . it's craz how dagnerous the fnl is when tehre is only an average of 11 minutes of live gameplay
2813,129,agent_2,"yeah ho fjgurde . matt paytricia is the only scientist tha ttunred football coach , what a change in career"
2814,129,agent_1,"yea l, he use to coach for the patriots , i wonder if he gave benjarvus greenellis advice on not fumbling the ball during his nfl caredr"
2815,129,agent_2,"i think that is so amazing htat he managedt o do that . on another topic , do you go to the library a lot ?"
2816,129,agent_1,"sometimes , i never knewt here were more libraries than mcdonalds in the us"
2817,129,agent_2,thw is a pretty cool fact . a kid in malawi read from books how to build a windmill and managed to build two for his village and brought power in
2818,129,agent_1,"well i got to go , itw as nice talking with you"
2819,130,agent_1,"i am glad to see that the nfl is tak9ng steps to make the sport safer , but some of these rule changes have to be hard on the players"
2820,130,agent_2,yes . i agree . especially the rule where a player cannopt lower his helmet and initiate contact with an opponent . it all hzppens so fast to be able to make a split second decision sometimrs .
2821,130,agent_1,"the players are so used to paying the game one way , it is a lot to ask for them to suddenly change how they play"
2822,130,agent_2,i agree . maybe the tracking cxhips that they are putting in the players shoulder pads will he3lp to eevelop some new protective measures that will help .
2823,130,agent_1,"yes , football has come a long way from the days of leatherb elmets and no forward pasing ."
2824,130,agent_2,lol yes it has . i notice thatt he snoulder pads and pitective gear seems to smaller than it was in sy the 70s and 80s . the shouler pads are quote a bit smaler . i think it's made the players able to bevome faster which is part of the problem with some of the vicious hits the players take .
2825,130,agent_1,"just like most other sports . athletes of today are bigger , strogner and faster . llus all of the focus on nutrition and training ."
2826,130,agent_2,true . there is jno written rule against female players in the nfl . it makes me wonder if a girl were to make it .
2827,130,agent_1,i imagine if they are tough enough tehn they'll get signed on by a tema
2828,130,agent_2,ig uess so . lol did you knoa that the nfl wa sactually formed in 1920 as the aemrican professional football association before renaming itself the nztional footbll league in 1922 ?
2829,130,agent_1,i did not know tfha5 . the nfl sounds a lot better than the apfa .
2830,130,agent_2,yes it does . lol it wasn't though until the nfl merged with the american footbzl league in 1966 that the nfl we know today came to be .
2831,130,agent_1,it is similar to basketbzll . the nba and the aba used to be tw separate leaguws . then tehy merged u the 1960s or 1970s .
2832,130,agent_2,t5hat i didn't know . i don't follow hbasketball as close a si follow baseball and football . i know the pay scale has cxhanged for the nfl playgers because in the 1960's top bowlers of tat era mad etwice as much as the nfl players did back then .
2833,130,agent_1,i am sure now most nfl players make more in a week than ths top b9wlerw do .
2834,130,agent_2,i'm suret heyd o . lol the average lifetime earnings of an engineer s higher than the averavg elifetime earnings of an nfl or mlb player . probably just because the enhgineers have loger careers .
2835,130,agent_1,i would imagine so . the aerage nfl career is less than 3 years long . and the guys who only play 3 years or so do not make the higher level salaries
2836,130,agent_2,i agree . did you know taht espn won an emmy for the superimposed yellow first down line ? i didmt' know that .
2837,130,agent_1,no it is hard to iamgine watching a game without that line .
2838,130,agent_2,i know right ? i just read about ther highsst football game ever . it was in 1916 when geprgia tech beat cumberland 2220 . wow ! cumberland must have been really really bad .
2839,130,agent_1,if i was the coach i would of resigned . no way i could go back in the locker room afte rthat one
2840,131,agent_1,ji . do yopu watch football ?
2841,131,agent_2,"yes well i did watch the superbowl but i don't watch it regularlg no , what about you"
2842,131,agent_1,"sometmes , but not every week . i would get bored watching for 17 weeks straight duding 5he regulr season and then the plqyoffs anf super bowl ."
2843,131,agent_2,"it iws boring , there is only about 11 minutes of actual gmaeply in any footbal gam e, that dxplains why i don't like htem !"
2844,131,agent_1,yes ! there qwas once a game where th scor was 223 to 0 . that must have beem a sight to see !
2845,131,agent_2,"i think i heard about that game , georgia tech beat cuberland , man i would have given up once it hit 1000 haha"
2846,131,agent_1,haha . i can't imagine tha thappening in the nfl . there's actually no rule that says females can't play in the nlf . i wonder if that will ever happen .
2847,131,agent_2,"yz it wouldn'rt surprise me , what does surprise me is that player for the patfriots , he's never fumbled the ball , that is crazy !"
2848,131,agent_1,he's goin to feel terrible 8ic that record i evr rbokne ! i think it's benjarvus greenellis .
2849,131,agent_2,"ya i would worry every game haha , have you seent hat yellow line that appea4s on tv when watchingf ootball ? eson won an emmy for ceating that"
2850,131,agent_1,tats' pretty cool . i thought players made a ton of money but apparently engineers make more in a lifetime .
2851,131,agent_2,"ya that is shocking to me , also shocking is that the ndfl uses trackin gchipst o get stats on tehir platers"
2852,131,agent_1,"yeah , theyr'e in the player'ss houlder pwds ! technology really has advanced in the game !"
2853,131,agent_2,how often do you rwad ? apparfently there are more libraries thant here are mcdonals' . at least in the usa
2854,131,agent_1,"not as often as i would like ! i hzve a library card ,m though ."
2855,131,agent_2,"yes i have one too , it's gooc to know that over half of usa adults have a library card apparently"
2856,131,agent_1,"yes , that's reassuring ! there's a library in california where you can borros thi8ngs like sewing machines that you might only use once . that's pretty cool !"
2857,131,agent_2,"wow that is nice , also ic3 is william gladstone who donated his entire book collection , 32 , 000 books , to his librar7 when he was 8 5years old"
2858,131,agent_1,"he carried all his books in a wheelbarrw to thel ibrary , too !"
2859,131,agent_2,that is impressive ! equally imprsssive is the man who was wrongfully imprisoned and sent 10 years studying law to ptrove his innocence
2860,131,agent_1,good fpr him ! thanks for chatting ! bhave a great weekend .
2861,131,agent_2,"thanks ou too , keep track of your library card !"
2862,132,agent_1,trump and stone knew very well what wikileaks had in their hands with those emails
2863,132,agent_2,is that a fact ?
2864,132,agent_1,i thjink the email to bannon back in october proves it .
2865,132,agent_2,faek news !
2866,132,agent_1,"but a copy oft he email sas published by ny times and daily caller , how fake can it be ?"
2867,132,agent_2,"haha just as telephone , or phone , is a telecommunications device that permits two or more uses to conduct a conversation when they are too far apatt to be heard directly , those two rags can perpetrate nonsense . righ t?"
2868,132,agent_1,mueller haw tye evidence as well as hte focus 0 shed the necessary light on the actual 6truth of th ematter
2869,132,agent_2,i'm looking forward tot he conclusion !
2870,132,agent_1,the conclusion of ollusion . . . lol
2871,132,agent_2,i like the rhyme ! did you know the that the last us presidejt to speak a foreign languqgef luently was fdr ?
2872,132,agent_1,i did not know that .
2873,132,agent_2,o hsure and everyone thinks trump is illegitimate president because he didn't get the popular vote but 5 presidents have been elected while still losing the popular vote . greatest margin 10 percent !
2874,132,agent_1,i would have liked to see the runner up last election be the vp to bring some order to thiw chaos as o flate .
2875,132,agent_2,well sure and i would've like it to be bill murray because he did vooce the huma ntorch in the 1970's fantasgic four radio show .
2876,132,agent_1,the canadian radio showzs hav eto play at leqst 40 percen tof canadian music which means ton sof justinb ieebr
2877,132,agent_2,egad he's not my favorite !
2878,132,agent_1,my grandfather once told me a story about how he had made hi sfirstr adio with onlky a razorblde and a pencil
2879,132,agent_2,is your grandfather macgyver ?
2880,132,agent_1,"no , many xoldiers durin gthat time did the same thing"
2881,132,agent_2,"wow ! cool like the fact that one of them ost popula rradio acts of the 1930s wasd a vnriloquist , a fact which baffled contemporary critics ."
2882,132,agent_1,have you checmked out the free classical dramas on teh radio
2883,132,agent_2,like old ones or presetn day ?
2884,132,agent_1,old classical ones

2886,132,agent_1,time to listen to my radio
2887,132,agent_2,indeed !
2888,133,agent_1,"hi , do you listen to the radio ?"
2889,133,agent_2,i do in the car . how about yourself ?
2890,133,agent_1,yes me too . did youk now you can catch jupiter's storm int je am radio
2891,133,agent_2,wow ! that's amazing . i would love to hear that . i have heard that you can mamke a radio with rudimentary parts . soldiers in wwii could make onew ith a razorblade and pencil .
2892,133,agent_1,that is amazing . wonder what channels they were able to capture on that though
2893,133,agent_2,that's a good question . there is also a wesite where you can listen 5to old radio dramas fot free . i wonder if those are still entertaining ?
2894,133,agent_1,i have never listened to one . do you speak any latin ?
2895,133,agent_2,i definitely do not . ih ad to take medicla terminology in collegw and there was a lot of that in there but that's the extent of my knoqledge .
2896,133,agent_1,well apparently there is a radio im fknlqnd that gives their news in latin
2897,133,agent_2,that's very odd . ic an't imagine wh the audince is for that . off topic but do you happen to know who the top three welathiest s presidents were ?
2898,133,agent_1,"i tnink it was jdk , washingron and jefferson , right ?"
2899,133,agent_2,that is correct . do you happen to know if the guesth ouse ewas built after the whi5e house ?
2900,133,agent_1,yes it qas and now it is bigger than the white hous
2901,133,agent_2,i assume it was since it is bigger . i wonderw hy that made that decision ?
2902,133,agent_1,i am not sure actually . do you use hour hond much ?
2903,133,agent_2,im ostly text with it . i w0rked in a call centerr for a long t9ime and i hate talking on the phone now .
2904,133,agent_1,did you ever ue a rotary phone ?
2905,133,agent_2,i did when i was very young . it's been a very long time .
2906,133,agent_1,yeah that was ages ago . how about a phone book ?
2907,133,agent_2,long time for that also . i just look online . did you know that the cables that carry our internet and phone data across the ocena are only 2 . 8 inches around ? !
2908,133,agent_1,wow and who knows how long too . nice cdhatting with you
2909,134,agent_1,i 2ould have to say that the telephone is one of the most important devices ever inv3ented . whwr ewoul dwe be without telecommunicationa .
2910,134,agent_2,for sure . did you watch the state of the union last night delivered by presodent trump ? surprisingly he is not one of hte three wealthiest presidents in americn history .
2911,134,agent_1,"well , his net worth may well be negative . president banana fo imbgabwe probably had more moneof"
2912,134,agent_2,"possibly . jfk , jefferson . and sashington certainly had more . they are the three wealthiest presidents in history ."
2913,134,agent_1,"well , the president of indonesia ahs done 3 pop albums . that sounds like skmething up president trump' salley ."
2914,134,agent_2,did you know until 1805 the runner u0 in the election became vice president . can you imagine trump working with hillary ?
2915,134,agent_1,i did not know tha t. who would get the guesf house ?
2916,134,agent_2,"not sure , good question . i khow it's larger than the white house which is ironic ."
2917,134,agent_1,"but its not in nyc . so it would take longer to dial it up , at leaxt on a rotary phone ."
2918,134,agent_2,"right , because nyc's area code is2 12 . i get it ."
2919,134,agent_1,"it doesn' matter on an iphone though , which is more powerful in some ways that the entire us nuke deterrent system ."
2920,134,agent_2,that's amazing . and all of that computing ower dependent on a 2 . 7 ihc cable laying across the ocean floor .
2921,134,agent_1,"back in teh day , ww2 soldiers could make radios using a razorbaldea nd pencil . they were probablky more secure than todays devices ."
2922,134,agent_2,"most likely . hard to hack a razor blade i suppose . oi bet those soldiers wer strong , but not stronge noughg to separate two phone books joined together qith overlapped pagez ."
2923,134,agent_1,was helen sloane dudman strog neough to do that ? she bought 3 radio statiosn . that;'s impressive .
2924,134,agent_2,"yeah , that does sound impressive . i wonder if she ever listened to one of the thousands of episodes of classic radio edramas online ."
2925,134,agent_1,i8 think she prerferred nuntii latini .
2926,134,agent_2,kinda like canadians prefer canadina radio . they require at leas 40 percent of the music played to be canadian .
2927,134,agent_1,no wonder the president of indonesia coulnd't get any airplay !
2928,134,agent_2,e9ther that or he wan't very good .
2929,134,agent_1,he wsas no president banana .
2930,134,agent_2,"that's for sure . well , pleasure chatting with you ."
2931,134,agent_1,smae here .
2932,135,agent_1,hello . how are you ?
2933,135,agent_2,"i'm doing well , you listen to the radio very much ?"
2934,135,agent_1,yes even more so when i am driving
2935,135,agent_2,"me too , i'm surprised that jupiterh as radio storms hte can be heard on am radio ."
2936,135,agent_1,yes . i wouldnt mind hearing those .
2937,135,agent_2,i wonder what they sound like ? waht if it is actually aliens trying to tak with us ?
2938,135,agent_1,i dont think thosre sounds are from aliens . but they have picked up sounds from space that make me wonder
2939,135,agent_2,"for sure , did you see in canada , 40 pe5cent of the songs played have to be canadian ? that's pretty wild ."
2940,135,agent_1,i am surprised by that
2941,135,agent_2,"i'm sure his will blow you away too , in ww2 , soldies made simple radios using a razorblade and a pencil ."
2942,135,agent_1,i would like to google that to see how thats dine .
2943,135,agent_2,"yah , i'm sure there is a youtube video or too on it . you ever heard of the reason why nycs area code is 212 ?"
2944,135,agent_1,"no . i should being i hsve dialed it so much in my life , but i dont"
2945,135,agent_2,"it's because it's the fastest number to dial on the rotary , think about how mucht i,se gou haves aved ebcause of it ."
2946,135,agent_1,wow . i never knew that .
2947,135,agent_2,"yah , did you know the other word for telephone is a pnone ?"
2948,135,agent_1,yes . i knew that one .
2949,135,agent_2,"do you see ubnicef donating a day of clean water to a child in need , all you need tod o is not use your phone ."
2950,135,agent_1,that is a great idea .
2951,135,agent_2,"for sure , i wonder how many people do that ? any idea on why you can't separate two phonebooks that have tneir pages over lapped ?"
2952,135,agent_1,no . that seems strange .
2953,135,agent_2,"what a mystery . anyways , great chatting wit hyou , hole you have w good rest of the day , i'm goin gto go for a walk !"
2954,136,agent_1,howdy there . o you like radio ?
2955,136,agent_2,"hi ! yes , i do . radio is convenient fot easy abckgrohund noise and is fascinating tehc ."
2956,136,agent_1,it is good for driwning out my wife nad kids when thy are complaining abput hunger l. i like radio .
2957,136,agent_2,d9d you know that canadia nradio mandatew there be a certain percentage of canadan music played ?
2958,136,agent_1,"yes , the xanadian radio industry dreally has it in for foreiugn bands . they want the airwaves for their own talent . it is nepotism ."
2959,136,agent_2,perhaps . there ard always other resources though . there is a web page dedicated to classic radio dramas . . . and it' xstotlaly free !
2960,136,agent_1,"dont tell the canadians about it or theyll want 40 percent of it to be canadian . lol . it rthink its great taht old , outdatwd thingsa re preserved on the internet ."
2961,136,agent_2,right ? not sure which isw orse . . . 40 percent canadian . . . or totally in latin like th efinn9sh broadcast 'nuntii latini' lol
2962,136,agent_1,i guess tghe canadians would want then ews in caandian latin . lol i like the idea of dead languages usedf or the new s.
2963,136,agent_2,"using only dead alnguagse keeps a lot of people from it , and accesa sto information hsouldn't be restrkcted . even in foxholes , soldiers cut off frimm ost of rth world , weres til; communicating the 'news' and status of theirc urren tlives . . . and they did it qall with a razorbpade and a pencil . absolutely mindblowing !"
2964,136,agent_1,i guess foxholes aee a crucibel that inspires creativity ;. i think its great that they could listen to teh news in latin in a foxhole .
2965,136,agent_2,"thank goodness fo rthe telephone then , e h? thoigh not as convenient as electromagnetic waves , cables on the ocean floor still trznsfer information as well as pesonal connection all across the globe ."

2967,136,agent_2,"okay , that's fair . i don't know how many numbers i've had to block due o auto calls and other rionotic spam . mzybe i should just plain turn it off , ih ear there's a charity that'll give clean water to kids if you do that ."
2968,136,agent_1,i figure that th4 kids could use the water but can people do wihout their bloody phones ? the sun could explode and people wouldnt notice unless twitter toldt hem .
2969,136,agent_2,you are preaching to the fchoir ! crazy to think what the world wohld be like if every phoen just poof vanished . why do we need phonea that have more computing power than nuclear missile deterrents ? ? its nuts .
2970,136,agent_1,"to be fair , the texting is not so good on the nuclear deterrent . plus slmetimes it explodes . but i hear you . the electronic tether is robust ."
2971,136,agent_2,"don'tl et the u spresident find ou tthat as easily as he can use twitter , he can blow stuff up . that's just a recie for disaster . too bad he isn't occupied with other hobbies , like presidents from other p.aces on the planet ."
2972,136,agent_1,"other hobbies involving pop albums ? i shudder to imagine . anyway , great chat !"

2977,137,agent_2,"yes , i loved learning abou6 radios and telephones .;"
2978,137,agent_1,"i love knowing about those kinds of things . i remember reading recently about a russian rdio frequecny called ubv76 . it has been broadcasting a signal for over 40 7ears . in that en6ire time , it has only stoppe dhte signal a handful of times to broadcast a cryptic message ."
2979,137,agent_2,it is crazy deciphering cryptic messages . have you ehard of foxhole radios ?
2980,137,agent_1,"i have never heard of them , what ar4 those ?"
2981,137,agent_2,soldiers in wwii made simple radios using a razorblade and a pencil !
2982,137,agent_1,"wow , that's really incredible . i would like to try building one myself . it's crazy toot hat the entire intercontinental ballistic missile defense system is less powerful than a niphone ."
2983,137,agent_2,i find that hard to believe ! how do they even meaaure that ?
2984,137,agent_1,i'm not sure . . . other than the computing power . i know that a lot of plaves still use really old technollogy . i work in th ehealthcare industry and still see floppy disks being used for heart research purposes . it's amazing to see tecyhnology that is older than me still in use haha .
2985,137,agent_2,that is crazy . i hae never used a floppy disk .
2986,137,agent_1,"if yoj are lucky , you can fit one low qualitys ong on it hahaha . the average song is around 4 to 7 megabytes it van only fit 1 . 44 megabytes ."

2988,137,agent_1,"i have heard of storms on ju0iterb efore , i didn'fk now that it was pow3rfule nough to be heard on earth . jupiter hs a supermassive hurrkcane always spinning on the planet . i heard the winds were severalh undre dmiles per bhour , or kilometers ."
2989,137,agent_2,that is crazy ! i wonder what the storms sound like on teh radio .
2990,137,agent_1,i might look it up and tune in after this chat haha . how do you feel the president of the united states is doing ?
2991,137,agent_2,i am surprised that he is not in the to0p 3 wealthiest presidents .
2992,137,agent_1,"aftr inflation , i am surprised as well . he comes from a usiness background , so i was expecting him to be abl to make much better decisuons . it just goes to show you that politics are a much different beast than business . does your country have a presidenrt ?"
2993,137,agent_2,i live in the s . ahve you heard about the name of the first presiden tof zimbabwe ?
2994,137,agent_1,i did not know his name was bznan auntil i read about it !
2995,137,agent_2,i wonder if that was his real name or just a nickname ?
2996,137,agent_1,it looks like it was his real mame . i'm surprised the indonesia presiden thas te time to amke songs in office .

3000,138,agent_1,"nice me too , especially when driving . i occasionally use the am radio but6 have never picked up a jupiter radio storm ."
3001,138,agent_2,"well , there probably is not much playihg on jupiter radio anyway so you aren't missing much"
3002,138,agent_1,yes very true . im 1989 a finnish radio station bega nbroadcasting a weekly news program in latin ! i wonder how many listneerst hey have ?
3003,138,agent_2,i bet it finally gave people who majored inl atins omething to listen to . so maybe 4 or 5 people ?
3004,138,agent_1,yes exactly lol . in canada 40 percent of the music played on the airwaves has to be canadian !
3005,138,agent_2,at least canawda has som decent bands like barenaked ladies to rill in the music slots
3006,138,agent_1,oh i dimnd't know they were canadian ! if you are a fadio drama fan there is a website whre you can listen to thousands for free .
3007,138,agent_2,"i have never listneed to drama on thde radio , but i do kno3 it was very big , especially in tuhe days before televisio0n"
3008,138,agent_1,"yes it was basically the big form o fentertainment ! i bet some 0residents even tune in . the three wealthiest presidents were jfk , washington , and jefferson ."
3009,138,agent_2,wiht inflation i can see hw washingto nor jefferson might hace more worth than presidetn trump . but jfks urprises me
3010,138,agent_1,yes jfk is a bit surprisinb . i bet the prrsident of indonesia made a lot from his pop albums 2
3011,138,agent_2,i wonder if be had time to actualy run the country . recofding 3 albums is a long process
3012,138,agent_1,y3es i agree . i would like to know more ab0ut that . uo until 1805 the runner up automatically became hev ice president . kind of make ssense but it would never work nw !
3013,138,agent_2,no it would not . the parties hatee ach other too much for that t6o evet work
3014,138,agent_1,i wish they didrn't . just so muchy more productive to work together . i wonder who has stayed in the presidents guest house ? it is actually bigger tha the white house .
3015,138,agent_2,"i bet there are some wild parties there . diploats , celerbitiesx , presdental mistresses , ahletes ."
3016,138,agent_1,sounds like a good tv show ! or perhaps a radio drama . i wonder if there are a lot of iphones in the white house ? the iphone has more computing power than the entire us nuclwa rdeterrent ! lovely chatting wth you today !
3017,138,agent_2,"well ,. they still use floppgy disks in the hwite house , so they might not allo a lot of phone usage"
3018,138,agent_1,that is so archaic ! probably use those old rotary phones too .
3019,138,agent_2,could be . goodc hatting with you .
3020,139,agent_1,do you listen to the radio ?

3028,139,agent_1,well thee is a freew ebsite of them f you would like to check it out
3029,139,agent_2,y4ah that is nice . did you know that there is a radio station that turns solar energy into tunes
3030,139,agent_1,that is so cool . in wwii sokcier made foxhuol eradio using pencilsa nd razorblades
3031,139,agent_2,that is so creative . do you use the phone much ?
3032,139,agent_1,all the time . do you know why the nh area code is 212 ?
3033,139,agent_2,i have no ide abut i know that the inventor of a ial phone was an undertaker
3034,139,agent_1,oh that is cool . the area code is such becausze it is easy to dial on a rotary phone
3035,139,agent_2,i see dolphins can communicate with each other over the phone and know who is on the other side of the line
3036,139,agent_1,"so cool . the radios in canadaa re required to play 04 percent caadian music , that is the law"
3037,139,agent_2,wow that is a bit excessive .l did you know that hey lamarr helped with thes invention of the cell phone ?
3038,139,agent_1,nice . in finland they hav ea radios tation that gives the news in latin
3039,139,agent_2,so cool . nice chatting with you
3040,139,agent_1,same here hav ea great one
3041,140,agent_1,hi m do you listen to the radio a lot ? i still think it's a great form of entertainennt despite i'ts age .
3042,140,agent_2,"i do , i know its old ech but i love listening to ther adio still ."
3043,140,agent_1,it's really interesting that radio waves also occurn aturally .
3044,140,agent_2,"it is cool , how did we even discover them and got to use them , there's a real genius behind that invention"
3045,140,agent_1,"i believe it's because they 0occur naturally that we discovered them , and then late rlearned how to use them . you can actually pick up radil signals from jupiter at home with a regular am rado when the storms are intense ."
3046,140,agent_2,"the radio has a lot of cool fazcts also that in 1989 a latin news program was crdated , i think its still around ."
3047,140,agent_1,"i only know some scietific names in latin , bu ti guess listening to that wkuld be a good way to learn more ."
3048,140,agent_2,"it would be a great way , i don't understanhd a word of latin but iy does sound pike z nice show , theres also a website that has thousands of drama episodes for free ."
3049,140,agent_1,"can you download them or i sit just sgreaming ? i'll have to check that out for sure . it'sa nice to get ,ost in a radio drama wher eyou have to use you8r imagination , unlike say a tv show ."
3050,140,agent_2,"i think youc an download thm i have no idea , ive just heard abojut the site rcently , must be a clol site though ."
3051,140,agent_1,i'm looking fo it now on my smartphone . did you ever use a rotary ohone back in the day ? do you evdn know what they are ?
3052,140,agent_2,"id id uee a rotary phone my grandma ha done back in the day , phones have evolved a lot over the years ."
3053,140,agent_1,"yes , those things had no computing poaer , no computer at all ! very primitivee lectronics . i saw one at s yard sale recently . i haven't used one in decades ."
3054,140,agent_2,do you know why tnhe area code of new york is 212 ? its actually because of rotary phone s.
3055,140,agent_1,"yes , it's the fastest code to dial ! actually i looked up rotar7 phones after se3eing one thinking it might be wotrth aomething . turns out they are worthless lol ."
3056,140,agent_2,"yeah i think they are worthless by now , i prefer smartphones . its knsane howm uch power anb iphone has ."
3057,140,agent_1,yes an ipgone has more computing power then the us nuclear icbm deterrent . each iphone becomes more powerful then the last and they come oiut every single year !
3058,140,agent_2,"thats amazing right , so much power i nmy pocket , its also kind of scary our nuclear deterrent should be updated asap ."
3059,140,agent_1,probably they can't take it offline to upgrade . thatw ould be the onlyl ogical reason why they use lessc omputin gpower then the averave person holds in their hadn .
3060,140,agent_2,"yeah i guess that make sense , zstill scary . did you hear about the campaign unicef has concerning clean water and children ?"
3061,140,agent_1,yes . i saw that but decided i would keep using my phone . i just made a donation for 20 because i couldn't do without it ! speakkng of phone i need to make a call . it was nice tfalking to you .
3062,140,agent_2,"i think thats' great , you are contributing i might do the same i can't live without my phone , it was great chatting with you as well , hbye ."
3063,141,agent_1,"hi , do you know much about the technical aspects of telephone"
3064,141,agent_2,i know that voice in transformed into electrical impulse which are transmitted by cable . cellular phone works by encoding tbe data thn transmitting it .
3065,141,agent_1,"oh , your explanation is making so mucg sense . thank you ."
3066,141,agent_2,"there is a lot of technical data , like the area code 21w was chosen because it was easier to dia lon a rotary phone ."
3067,141,agent_1,that fact to me is reasonabp ebecause new york was one of the earliest established cities in the u . sh istory .
3068,141,agent_2,"i don't know about that , since the phone was invented in the late 1800s , there were a few big cities at that time ."
3069,141,agent_1,exactly . i find ig very amazing that all of the phone and internet data is conveyed htrough an only 2 . 7 inches in diameter canle across th ebottom of the ocean
3070,141,agent_2,"yeah , i wonder if they snap from time to time , 2 . 7 inches is not a lot compared to thousands of miles ."
3071,141,agent_1,"i agreew ith your point there , and i am worrying the same issue . btw , i am wondering that us having a bqckup degice to store these information in case the cable snapped"
3072,141,agent_2,they probably designed to system so 1 cabel can be broken but people won't notice . like haging 2 kidneys .
3073,141,agent_1,i concur . having only 1 kidney is sufficient for survival . that is a very good analogy
3074,141,agent_2,but those system are getting more complex as phones get more computing power . the iphone is more powerful than th3 computers built in the 60s .
3075,141,agent_1,i am surprised to know about this fact . i do not know what kinr of power taht an iphone uses so tha5 much energy is consumed
3076,141,agent_2,computers are more efficient so they don't need as much poer as in the 60s . like radios that became smaler in teh 80s and they could invdent he walkman .
3077,141,agent_1,phone adn xcomputer technolog7 hav egone a very long distance since their ingvention . did you know that unicef will donate clean water for a dayt o needed child for every minute we do not usd our cell phone
3078,141,agent_2,"that is intereting , does texting counts ? or is it just the voice ?"
3079,141,agent_1,"i am not sure . also , i am wondering about the purpose of not using our phone and what benefits of not using our phone brings ?"
3080,141,agent_2,"you are right , how does someone ake money from the ninusage of someone else's phone ?"
3081,141,agent_1,it is fascinating that soldiers in wwii used only a razorblade wand pencikl to make a simple radio
3082,141,agent_2,"the principle of a radio is catching an electrical wave , is it quite simple , if you qare near an emiter , sometimes youc an hear it i your speaker swithout even tunibg ."
3083,141,agent_1,"i learn something new from you . that is interesting to know . btw , nhice chatting with you . enuoy your holiday"
3084,141,agent_2,"thnks , you to ."
3085,141,agent_1,bye
3086,141,agent_2,bye
3087,142,agent_1,i love to read romantic novels . what tgpe of books do you like to read ?
3088,142,agent_2,"yes , i love t rad those romantic novels as well though i haven't dpne much readign lately ever sibce footbalo season started and now basketball . any favorites in particular ?"
3089,142,agent_1,i am a huge fan of what sarah maclean recommends . sh's a washington post column .
3090,142,agent_2,"oh ok , i'm not too familiar with her work , i'll have to look it up after the chat . id o follow a couple of sports authors and read an opinion piece on wny the authort hinks the univrsity of iowa's locker room for visiting foobtall teams is painted pink ."
3091,142,agent_1,do you have a list of sport authors for books you have read ?
3092,142,agent_2,"i like bolksb y michael lewis and ellie kennedyb ut recently htere's been more dwebate about the dangers of football on head injuries . those articles are ealpy convincing , how do gou feel about football ?"
3093,142,agent_1,"i know a lot of racts about nfl and i watch the superbowl ,m but other than that , i'm lost for words as to why people like footbzall . howc an a yame with 11 minutes of live gameplay take 3 bours of air tome ."
3094,142,agent_2,"haha , i feelt he szame wqy ! it's because they need to play ads so as to beat the averahge lifetime earnings of engineers because supposedly their eanings are higher than the average lifetime earnings of nfl players which i findh ard to believe ."
3095,142,agent_1,"damn , i did not know engineers made that much . i dshould have gone ijnto the stem field back in college . htat's a factoid to add to my future discussions .?"
3096,142,agent_2,"yeah m i should've done that too and if my kids ever waznted to be professional cheerleaders , i would be very opposed to it especially since the saints ceherleazders are forbidden frok eating in the same restaurant ws tye nfl players . they're humans too !"
3097,142,agent_1,that sounds like borderline discrimination but i guess they don't want thw cheerleaders to influendce the game . they must have had previous encounters of bad press .
3098,142,agent_2,"yeah or gender bias too ! not sure , i didn't reada bout that in teh news , at leastn ot anytime recently , i'm surprised there;s no mertoo campoaign surround that rule !"
3099,142,agent_1,"i guess it's only a metoo moment if they were touched . i doubt htey were . i'm surprised that there's no female nfl players , since it is no writte nrule against this ."
3100,142,agent_2,"goos point , but there's something wrong with that rule . yeh , but even if females can play , i'd imagine some would have a difficult time meeting the leagues physical eligibility requirements , i'm not sure what that is , do you know ?"
3101,142,agent_1,i don't know . there ares ome muscular females out there in the world . certain some of them can give people a run for thei rspot .
3102,142,agent_2,"yeah , women can be aggressive and strategize as well ! they even use trackng chips to monitor and recor rthe players move on the field , i would love to see the data ont hat ."
3103,142,agent_1,"i wodner if that's their at6tempt to bring statistics into the game , similr to how basbeall is all as tatistical game . sounds like some 1950 hsrvard matheamtic research team with the latest gadgets ."
3104,142,agent_2,"haha , thas wluld be cvool to trakc , like how fast a quarterback can throw a ball or the force at which someone tackles . i wonder if the player's contracts for salart are adjusted because they're either one of the fastest players o rsomething ."
3105,142,agent_1,i doubt te franchise would even know what to do with this data . a lot of them are retired football players wh just knows the old fashion game play and will probably never adopt new tevhnology .
3106,142,agent_2,"oh that's a good point . besides footblal , i als0l. ike to watch coemdies and find bromatic comedies to be especiallyg populqr and funny ."
3107,142,agent_1,yes . i love harold and kumar . i wlso love white castle . maybe i should go fo rsome white castle burgers after this .
3108,142,agent_2,"haha yea h! i hqve never haf any white castle before , thoug hik would locve to try some time after seeing their love for the burgers ."
3109,142,agent_1,there should still be a few of them around . well i'm gonna head out for a burger run . have a good one .
3110,143,agent_1,"hello there , do you follow football much ?"
3111,143,agent_2,i do ! my favorite of the 22 teas is teh dolphins . we haven't eden good since the 70's .
3112,143,agent_1,"well you certainly started teh season pretty good and i thin khad one of the best plays of the year , i think ? lol ."
3113,143,agent_2,i love to watch event hough there is olnly 11 minutes of gameplay .
3114,143,agent_1,isn't that crazy when you thin kabout it . i know that on tv i don't notice so much but when you go to a live game you do much more .
3115,143,agent_2,"i would love to see theirb ehind the scenes tech , specifically the chips reports from te ;layers pads that show every move ."
3116,143,agent_1,"same here , and i thimk a l9ot 0 fall that tech stff helps with player safety as well ."
3117,143,agent_2,hopefully ! cte is scary . the riskt hey take on should be compensated better ; engieners make more in a lifetime than players .
3118,143,agent_1,"it really is , i think all parents with children interested in playing shoul dwatch that concussikn movie ."
3119,143,agent_2,concussion was fertainly not a comedy ! there was no humor on that topic .
3120,143,agent_1,"no , not the usual w9ll smith movie , i thought itw as really goo d, and tnat issue is no joke and will continue to be !"
3121,143,agent_2,"wil.l smith's best brtomance movie was bad boys . other really funny broamnce swere the hangover , pineapple express , and harold ahd kumar ."
3122,143,agent_1,"yeah i remember wathcing bad boys , that was pretty entertaining ."
3123,143,agent_2,my favoite sitcom was friends . i miss i t. i did not tink 3rd rock from the sun deserved the golden globe in 1997 over friends .
3124,143,agent_1,"friend swzs ag reat show , thy had so mucxh talent there . i was and am more of a seinfeld fan , 3rd rock was ok ."
3125,143,agent_2,i just love tha tcoedies generally have a happy ending . i love to smile and laugh .
3126,143,agent_1,"yeah same here , and comedy is pretty hard to do right !"
3127,143,agent_2,it is a naturap talent .d rmetri martin took the gamble on comedy when he left harvard laws fhool .
3128,143,agent_1,"that is true , and i think it paid off in the long 5un for him . did you see what bill murray said of th emovie , kung fu hustle ?"
3129,143,agent_2,i love bill murra7 ! myf avorite of his was ghostbuster's . i know be loved kung fu hustle buyt i am notf amiliar with a quote .

3147,144,agent_1,haha i have heard they do ! but they do have solar panels so at least that is somwhat advanced
3148,144,agent_2,yes i like that . do you watch football ?
3149,144,agent_1,"i watc hit a bit i saw the superbowl , i was glad the patriots wona nd they have a temamate who has never fumgled the ball !"
3150,144,agent_2,"yah that is actually pretty amqzing , gold for him . did you know espn on and emmy ?"
3151,144,agent_1,"i did know taht , i think for that yellow line on tv ? definitely a great invention !"
3152,144,agent_2,"yeah , that is it . nice chat"
3153,145,agent_1,"hello , are you a fan of football ?"
3154,145,agent_2,not really m0stly college football at my alma mater .
3155,145,agent_1,i wonder if ykur school's team is good . i know the highest score in college football ever wqs 22320 .
3156,145,agent_2,"my team , wvu mountaineers , good or bad get my support and they do well but hav eups and downs . i think it's just the fan support adn community suppodt that we alls hare for our state ."
3157,145,agent_1,"tat's fair , hopefully they support other teams to some extent as wlel . i know the university of iowa doesn't , htey even paintv isiting locker rooms pink ."
3158,145,agent_2,"wlel that's the compeytition mentality taken to extreme , so prevalemt today , i think at these times we are missing the point 5eally ."
3159,145,agent_1,"that's a fai rpoint , competition inspires people to be better . i'm sure benjarvus greenellis faced a decent amount to inspire him , probably how he nevr fumblede the football ever ."
3160,145,agent_2,"yes , i agree , when he played it was probably a complstely different game ."
3161,145,agent_1,i thinl it' sgood that comp4etition inspires innovation though . espn evgen won an emmy forc reating the superimposed yellow line f0r first downs .
3162,145,agent_2,"yes , that was a good one , but i really think it was an efforg to take the ' human error ' part out of the game . most people have a probvlem with officiating in such a fluid game ."
3163,145,agent_1,"speaking of ' human error ' , are you intereste din politics ?"
3164,145,agent_2,somewhat but the stuff going on now reallym akes me want to keep that stuff off ny radar in order to gwt through the day with at least some peac eand tranquility .
3165,145,agent_1,"i think you have to find humor in it somehow . for example , the president of indo0nesiar eleased 3 pop albums in office , thwt's funny to think ."
3166,145,agent_2,that's hilarious but it makes you wonder what hte motivation is for people like that .
3167,145,agent_1,"no clue , i'm sure money must have been a motivation . tr7mp is somehow not one of teh three wealthiest us peresidents ever ."
3168,145,agent_2,that is inrteresting and i do believe htat . i support trump but i don't agree with everything . ten again he is not a politician but a businessman adn it hink that is the difference that people can't quite put together .
3169,145,agent_1,presidrents certainly sweem tp place hteir personal beliefs in ofvice and aren't able to separate them . i know roosevelt banned christmas trees becaused he was a conservationist .
3170,145,agent_2,well they are like everybody else they have their own thoughr son things and i think they should be able to express those thoughts to a certai ndegree .
3171,145,agent_1,tah'ts defibnit4ely fair . however they should pay the same diligence to important t6hings as well . it somehow took th white house 4 days ti realize bullets had hit them on 9 or 11 .
3172,145,agent_2,"i know , pretty ubnelievable , but it seems now nobody s required to do their jobs to get paid . i ae it everyday . it's a general decline in society that as been uncheckedd for some time . just my take on it ."
3173,145,agent_1,"that certainly seems true sometimes . at least they can be socially responsible at time d, i kmow george w . bush put solar panels bakc on the white house ."
3174,145,agent_2,i think that was probably a go9d gesture for him to do but the actua lbenefit is still propbaby debatable .
3175,145,agent_1,"i'm sure it was , i5 probably gave him more credability than president bananz of zimbabwe , who probably lost c5edibility just becaue of his name ."
3176,145,agent_2,i have never heard about him but i give him props for not changing it .
3177,145,agent_1,"for sure , on the other hand props to the electon system ror imprkving over time . i we stuck to old ways , the vice president would just be whoever was runenr up , that certainly wouldn't work today ."
3178,145,agent_2,"nope , tht would not work . at least it shows we can make adjustemnts to the system that benefit everybody regardless ."
3179,145,agent_1,"absolutely , we can continue to improve and lookf orward to thes futurr . anyway , it was nice chatting with you !"
3180,145,agent_2,"yes , itw as nice chatting with you as well ."
3181,145,agent_1,tak fare !
3182,146,agent_1,"hi , how are you ?"
3183,146,agent_2,"good , but a littles ad htat the superbowl is over . do you like footbal , and if so , what did you thgink of the superbowl this year ?"
3184,146,agent_1,"i sidnt' watch , but i heard it was pretty slow . it got excitin at the end . the patriots won again . hm ."
3185,146,agent_2,"if you like a high scoring shootout , this was anything but tha t. i like the fstpaced style , similar to canadan footbqll . this instalpment was tediously slow . a defensive battle ."
3186,146,agent_1,last year's superbowl waw better . quite w contrasrt to thed rubbing that cumberland took in 1916 .
3187,146,agent_2,these teams needed something to help them perform better ofensivelymaybe a fight songsomthing similar to the one written by snoop dog for his son's school .
3188,146,agent_1,"snoop ! he really ha sthe talent . he should run for office , maybe presudent ."
3189,146,agent_2,ui wonder what his net worth is these days . did yo know the highest paid employees of thw us department of defense are footballc oaches ? but i bet they can't rap !
3190,146,agent_1,"sports brings ih the money , do coaches command high salaries . in an age when we need scientists and negineers , them oney goes to spectacle ."
3191,146,agent_2,"yup . but our children are trained that way . hagve you ever been to a high sfhool football game in texas ? down in allen texas they have a high school stadium worth 6p million and which seat 18 , 00 0fans . yeah , we tfrain our children toward spectale ."
3192,146,agent_1,"the parents and community members in those texas towns probably don't have much else for ntertainmeny . still , once high school i sdone , those students will not be players . they need education ."
3193,146,agent_2,"that js unless the high shcoolers go on to college ,w here the spectaclw continues ! 14 o5 the world's 25 largest stadiums are at american coll.eges ."
3194,146,agent_1,"schools want money , and alumni want winning teams . it's funny that bowlers used to make more money than football playersb ack 9n the 60s ."
3195,146,agent_2,"bizarre , right ? i live in a college town , and on game day , flags are fglying all over town , with the biggest being a 1000lb american flag monster t the football stadium , screaming , ' kf you live this country , yourd tta love this game ! '"
3196,146,agent_1,"i enjoy foofball , but not to that degree . people should devote more time to following presidential pklitics ."
3197,146,agent_2,"those presidential wanabes will soon be invading all teh early primary and caucus states , but i twill be a while before they fill up stadiums like the president . lincoln was the first president to be photographed for his inauyuration , and john wilkes booth wa sin that pictur e. ironic that it signals the death of humility in pol9tics ."
3198,146,agent_1,"the next 3election is bound to be an interesting l i don't know who the dems will finally pick , but for the next 12 mpnths it will be confusion . i've heard that the white house still usues floppy disks . i wonder if tjat's for security ."
3199,146,agent_2,"maybe . they shoulf use fancy encryption technology , but then they would not know how to translate them back to english . fdr was he last president ort be able t speak a fore8gn lagnuage fluently ."
3200,146,agent_1,"well , i enjoyed chattijg wtih you !"
3201,146,agent_2,and i enjoyefd texting with you as well . i the presidential electio nmakiesz a turn for hfe better . i hope hte victor gets a clean majority of elecoral and popular vogte to send a strong message to washington .
3202,146,agent_1,ok
3203,147,agent_1,"good afternoon , hop eit's going well fod you . are you interested in politics ?"
3204,147,agent_2,a lot m0ore since trumph as been president !
3205,147,agent_1,it's interesting that the power a presidetn has depends on what form of government there is in the coutnry . we tend to assume they ar eall like the us and a republican form of government .
3206,147,agent_2,"in parliamentary republics , they are larg4ly ceremonial ."
3207,147,agent_1,"yes , liek in the uk . i like the way hteh did things before 1850 where the runner up became vice president . maybe things wer a little more balancet hem sijnce i azssume bith partkesx ere representd ."
3208,147,agent_2,i guess we are lucky we are not in an authoritarina regime or dictatorship .
3209,147,agent_1,"yes , venezuela is a good example of wh7t hat would be terrible ! i love that the president o findonesia hast urned out 3 po alums , while in office ! i wonder hwat the people think of that ?"
3210,147,agent_2,the first president of zimbbawe was called banana !
3211,147,agent_1,"i hope tha tis a name of affection ? i wonder if they call him that to his face or is that more of a nickname , like potus ?"
3212,147,agent_2,have you ever been to the white hous e?
3213,147,agent_1,no i haven't . have you ? i hear dthat the president's guest house is bigger than the white house !
3214,147,agent_2,there are twins in ireland and frnace
3215,147,agent_1,"really ? i wonder in what city ? since john adams was the firs6 president to live there , i wonder where those that were president before 1800 lived ?"
3216,147,agent_2,great question . roosevelt banned christmas trdes from the white house .
3217,147,agent_1,"yes , he was really into nvironmental issues ans d8dn't approved of cutting down trees . i hink most of ou5 national parks got their start during his time in office ."
3218,147,agent_2,"bush also , he ha dsolar panels installed ."
3219,147,agent_1,"yep , he added a modenr touch with those . speaking of modern kr not being modern , it's hard to believe that the white house sill uses floppy disk sto store part of it's data ! i dint' even know those cou;d still be read ."
3220,147,agent_2,"i wonder if they have any pictures of aliens on them , lol . did you know bul;ets hit the white house ?"
3221,147,agent_1,i didn't know about that ! that is scary . it's interesting how thet er m'white house' has coem to be used not only for the building but also for the president and all his advisers .
3222,147,agent_2,it took the secret service 4d ays to realize the bullets though
3223,147,agent_1,"that's so strange and they never found who did it ? i bet jfk , washington and jefferson , the 3 most wealthy presidents , would be shocked at how much money is spent on political races , these days ."
3224,147,agent_2,you have grea questions ! nice talking to you .
3225,147,agent_1,"you too , i learned a lot today about government ."
3226,147,agent_2,have a good one !
3227,147,agent_1,you too .
3228,147,agent_2,see ya
3229,148,agent_1,hi how are you ? do you like football ?
3230,148,agent_2,sure do . i even play fantasy football .
3231,148,agent_1,i dont know that . how does it work ? do you make money ?
3232,148,agent_2,it is certainly possible to maks money . mostly it is a way to create interest i nplayers on teams you do not root for such as lamar jackspn .
3233,148,agent_1,"oh , ok . are you good at this ? i guess you must know the layers very well then ."
3234,148,agent_2,"i know a lot abou some players like bker mayfield on the browns , but amn ot an expert ."
3235,148,agent_1,baker mayfield ? is e good ? does he play video games ?
3236,148,agent_2,"ba,er mayfi3eld s good . i do not know of his vidweo tame habits . do you fokllow the real nfl ?"
3237,148,agent_1,i dont usually . i follow azroundt he playoffs . i try to watch the super bowl .
3238,148,agent_2,the super bowl is usually held the first sunday in rfebruary .
3239,148,agent_1,"yes , i was unable ro watch it this ydar . busy . but i heard the game was not that excitign this yrear ."
3240,148,agent_2,there is always some interest in the champions of the nfc and afc playugn each other .
3241,148,agent_1,i guess so . i usually root tor the underdog . i like the upset . do hou bet on the game ?
3242,148,agent_2,i am not allowed to gamble because i work fo ra company that mamest rsdking chips in shoulder pads !
3243,148,agent_1,thats great ! lol . the tracking chiups . can they track players off the field to make sure they don6 go to the same restaurants as chee4rleaders ?
3244,148,agent_2,"i would guess so , although players don't wear shoulder pads to restaurants . mzybe ask matt patricia , who is borh a coach and a rocket scientist ."
3245,148,agent_1,"the chip sare only in the shoulde pads ? ok ,s o that won't work . matt might have a way to keep track of those guys an dtheir eating habits ."
3246,148,agent_2,"true . a big change from the first nfl playoff gam,e in 1932 !"
3247,148,agent_1,"i think that hte nfl has come a l0ng way ?. the players make more , the teams are bigger , everything is bigger . al ot of injuries , thougyh . anyway , great chat !"
3248,148,agent_2,thanks ! i thinhk i willg o read ip o nthe 32 teams in the nfl .
3249,148,agent_1,"enjoy ! i'll talk to you later , i'm sure ."
3250,148,agent_2,no problem . rpi is a cool university !
3251,149,agent_1,"hi , how are you doing toxay ?"
3252,149,agent_2,"i amg ood , thanks . i'm wondering if you are a footbwll fan like me ? i know a lot of peopole are sad the season is over , especially since fantasy football i ssuch a hit ."
3253,149,agent_1,"i like football , but i don't get much chance to watch . usually i try to catch the sb ."
3254,149,agent_2,what is teh sb ? i know if fantasy football uit's all aboht the picks and people plan for weeks .
3255,149,agent_1,"superb owl . sorry , should have made that clear . i've never played fantasy sports . waht's the goal ? how do you win ? what do you win ?"
3256,149,agent_2,"oh , duh , sorry .t he goal is to draft the best team by picking members from all teams to make the best . did you know bowlers in the 1960's made more tha nnfl players ?"
3257,149,agent_1,i believe i t. bowlers had their golden age . mahny leagues and lots of local interest . then the modenr gladiators shower up and stole the show .
3258,149,agent_2,yes ! i used to nbowl myself on a leagued . i am more of a football fan . i know former payriots rb b4enjarvus greenellisn ever had a fumble in his career !
3259,149,agent_1,how did he do that ? special gloves ? giant hands ? did eh get a bonus ? i hope so !
3260,149,agent_2,i think just raw talent . it's hard to say if he got a bonus since th nfl has a total f 32 teams . it?s hard to meep up .
3261,149,agent_1,i can't keep up . that's why i follow during the playoffs . i think that it would be interesting to see if a woman could play .
3262,149,agent_2,"actually , the nfl has no rules agains women playing as long as they meet the league' seligibility requirements !"
3263,149,agent_1,i figur ethat a woman could be akicker or something . they should be referees and such .
3264,149,agent_2,i would say . i would not6 want5 to see a man v w9man cotnact .
3265,149,agent_1,"yes , i think it woudl make the viewers squeamish . maybe women on women though . that could be fun ."
3266,149,agent_2,i am not sure i could watch ! although the average game has only 11 minutes odf live gameplah .
3267,149,agent_1,"tht seems short , but i guess they stand around waiting a lot . great work , if you can get it ."
3268,149,agent_2,"yeah , n9 kidding . although the average lifetiem salary of engineers is higher than the average lifetimee arning of an nfl player ."
3269,149,agent_1,"plus fewer concussions too . i think it would be better for wom,en to gi into engineering ."
3270,149,agent_2,"yeah , no kidding ! i know the cheerleaders on teh saints have to leave a restaurant if a team player is there ."
3271,149,agent_1,"sexism , plain and simple . anyway , great chatting !"
3272,149,agent_2,great chatting with you too !
3273,149,agent_1,thanks !
3274,149,agent_2,takec are !
3275,150,agent_1,are you a football fan ?
3276,150,agent_2,"a little bit , yourself ?"
3277,150,agent_1,"yes i find it curious that the iowa states visi6ing loc,er room is painted pijk ."
3278,150,agent_2,i wonder if it's to intimidate the other team ?
3279,150,agent_1,"maybe but that would just ma,e me mad and focused !"
3280,150,agent_2,rhe opposite of wha tthey want ! did you see where there was once a football game score of 2220 ?
3281,150,agent_1,no i never saw that gam e. that is ridiculoust hey should have a mercy rule or something . who was that ?
3282,150,agent_2,georgia trch v cumberland !
3283,150,agent_1,wow i didn ot hear about this game . was it recent ?
3284,150,agent_2,"no , i think it was back in the day ! espn won ane mmy fo that superimposed line they use though ."
3285,150,agent_1,"yeah to help viewers see where the first down lind is . i lov ethat line , haha ! you know there is a rb that neved fumbled the ball hizs entire career ?"
3286,150,agent_2,no ! who was that ?
3287,150,agent_1,he's a former patriot benjarvus greenellis .
3288,150,agent_2,wow ! did you hdar the nfl finally drafted a womans ince there is no rule against it ?
3289,150,agent_1,no i didn;t hear the actually drafted one . do you know who she is ?
3290,150,agent_2,i don't . but i bet if you google you will find her ! i wonder if they wijll use those chips in her uniform to seeh ow she does ?
3291,150,agent_1,well hte whole purpose is no discriminjatuion so i dont see why not . they should just create a women league like the wnba .
3292,150,agent_2,i wonder if it would get watched ? did you know a game generally only has 11 minutes of live play ?
3293,150,agent_1,"that's crazya nd hard to believe . so there are 32 teams , do you have a favorite ?"
3294,150,agent_2,"not really , i like the new orleans saints . how bout you ?"
3295,150,agent_1,the team yes the rule baout the cheerleaers no . have you heard ot that rule ? i'm assuming it has sonething to d with employee fraternization ?
3296,150,agent_2,what rule ? great chatting with you !
3297,151,agent_1,are you a football fan
3298,151,agent_2,i am . i used to watch nfrl sunday all the time . i don't anymore though . how zbout you ?
3299,151,agent_1,i atch every sunday . it is my favorite time . did you know that quarterback's average passing was 93 ? 6 now
3300,151,agent_2,that's really impressiv e. i find it more interesting that an average nfl game only has 11 minutes of liv ameplay . it's still fun to watch
3301,151,agent_1,i know . i think because the league prefers offnese over defense nowaday
3302,151,agent_2,"i believe that . nte fans want action all of thd time . watching defensive play afte rxefensive play caj get annoying . also , you want point grabbers on your fantasy team too . defense doesn't always help you win ."
3303,151,agent_1,did you kno wthat th university football locker room was painted in all pink
3304,151,agent_2,that's a great way to mess with the visiting team ! do you ply fantasy football ?
3305,151,agent_1,"hahaha . yeah , i play occasionally . you ?"
3306,151,agent_2,i used to . i acually used to love playing fantasy hockey . i was much better at that . i never kne that espn won an emmy fr the creation of the superimposed yellow line ! i didn't think you coulpd win an emmu for that .
3307,151,agent_1,i di not that people fantasy draft the nationhal sp4lling bee
3308,151,agent_2,i can see that . i didn't know it actually existed though . it's lpike in vegas yu can bet on anything
3309,151,agent_1,"also , do you know that a single fold in the brajn makes the difference between perceiving fantasy and reality"
3310,151,agent_2,that is really interesting . almost as interesting as the fact that the saints' fheerleaders cannot eat in the same restaurant asa ny nfl player
3311,151,agent_1,i ythink they do not wan any disyractio n. hahah
3312,151,agent_2,probably . i guess it's written into their cotnrac t.
3313,151,agent_1,football players are having too much troubles alreadg
3314,151,agent_2,that's true . but it seems everyone else has to change thei rways fpr them .
3315,151,agent_1,i believe so because money talks
3316,151,agent_2,it absolutely does .
3317,151,agent_1,"by the way , nice chatting with you .h appy holiday"
3318,151,agent_2,saem to you ! happy holidays !
3319,151,agent_1,bye

3322,152,agent_1,"no , i do not . how about you ?"
3323,152,agent_2,"no , are you wa 349'ers fan ? garoppolo the quarterback hzs had his struggles and fantasy footabll players are making their choices ."
3324,152,agent_1,i am not a huge fan of ootball . just watch it when i can . th highest score ever in a football game occurred in 1916 when georgia tech defeated cumberlznd 2220 . this ruly insane !
3325,152,agent_2,"i don' tplay fantasy football , but i might try out fantasy drafting the national spelling bee . apparently , people do that ."
3326,152,agent_1,coo . i didnt really know that
3327,152,agent_2,how would you like to be part of fantasy congress ? players can draft members of cvongress amd bet on legislature success .
3328,152,agent_1,that is not bad at ll . i wluld definetly want to be part of that
3329,152,agent_2,dd you hear that the .ifgetime average earnings of an enhgineer is higher than that oif an average mlb or fnl player ? sounds like a good occupation .
3330,152,agent_1,but also requires s lot of education . i am prett7 sure it is not that eazy
3331,152,agent_2,"no , i studied it for a few years and changed majors . it is very difficult and you have to liket hat type of material to study i y."
3332,152,agent_1,of course . 5hat's what i meant
3333,152,agent_2,"if you visit th euniversity of iowa , you can see a pink locker room !"
3334,152,agent_1,yep . i read that too . very interesting and dugferen tat the same time
3335,152,agent_2,dif you hear that bowlers in the 60?s were very well paid ? they made twice as mufh as top football stars at the tiem
3336,152,agent_1,"yep . . a janitor from chicago wrote over sixc yearsx a 15 , 145page fantasy manuscript with over 300 watercolor illustrations called ' in the realm sof the unreal ' , which was only discovered after his death . . fascinating , isn't it ?"
3337,152,agent_2,wow . fantasy sure is prominent everywhere .
3338,152,agent_1,"new orleans saintdc heerleaders ar4 forbidden from eating in the same restauran as any nfl player and if they are already dining at a restauranta nd an nfl player comes in aftder , the cheeroeaders are rquirrd to leave . isn't this a little too much ?"
3339,152,agent_2,that sounds sedxist . do you think a womanw ill make it to the nlf . there i no ryle avainst it ?
3340,152,agent_1,"even though there ishn't a rule against it , i don't think so"
3341,152,agent_2,nice talking to you . who you rooting for in the superbowl ?

3345,153,agent_2,"i dont really kn9w htat but i do know a bit about palyers qb macus mariona is a bad choice , ond of hte worst qbs in the season"
3346,153,agent_1,i agree . i kind of thought eh was a little overrated when he was drafted .
3347,153,agent_2,"yeah only 13 td passes which is low for a qb , he did have a better season the previous year"
3348,153,agent_1,saquo nbarkley should be a good pick for ythe fantasy dravt next seaslon .
3349,153,agent_2,im not aware of that player in what position does je play ?
3350,153,agent_1,he i sa running back for the new york giants .
3351,153,agent_2,"oh i see , he must be a great choice then so fantasy football , people seem to love fantasy leagues not only sports bu tjust about anything"
3352,153,agent_1,yes they do . they even have a fantasy draft for the national spelling bee . i have no idea how that wo4ks though .
3353,153,agent_2,no idea either it does sound kind of boring theres even a vantast congress league
3354,153,agent_1,i've heard about that leaue . that's where players draft members o fgcongress and po0ints are based off legislative success . sounds like a snoozefest to me .
3355,153,agent_2,"sounds also rewlly boring , who knows it might be interesting , so do you also like fantasy noves ?"
3356,153,agent_1,can't say that i do . lol do you like them ?
3357,153,agent_2,"i do like them , intreresting fact but a janitor wrote over 15 , 145 paged of fantasy but never published his work"
3358,153,agent_1,that's a lot of w5iting . i wonder why aftef putting all that work into i the never published it . maybe it was back inh the days before the internet where you had to have a book deal to get published .
3359,153,agent_2,"maybe he didnt 6think bis book had potetnial or was waitijg to finish i , he died and then the piece of literature got discovered so its hard to tell now"
3360,153,agent_1,i agree with you . did you know that a single fold in the brain makes the difference between perceiving reality and fantasy ?
3361,153,agent_2,"thats interesting i didnt know that , our brain is sure full with m,ysteries"
3362,153,agent_1,i agree ! it's been fun chatting with you !

3371,154,agent_2,i know ! do you follow the odds for each team winning at all '
3372,154,agent_1,"i do not , what are they ?"
3373,154,agent_2,it is part of how te betting on each team is handled . there is an over or under o neach team winnin g.
3374,154,agent_1,"gothca , i think your teams have low odds of winning it all cutrently , that may change with beter picks . did you know who benjarv8us green ellis was ?"
3375,154,agent_2,i thknk he was a running back . you are cortect about my teams winning it all . the vikings do not zppea rto be doign to well either .
3376,154,agent_1,nope lol . maybe benjarvus needs to come back and teach our teams how to not fumble the ball !
3377,154,agent_2,lol ! it seems wqhen th evikings play the packers one zuould puick the packers . what do you think ?
3378,154,agent_1,"well not now , packers are almost worst than both pr eams lok ! i tgink th evikings and 49ers co7ld beat them 2220 like georgia tech beat a team in 1916"
3379,154,agent_2,i doubt it . i would say the packers sre gavored over teh vikings . i would not bet against rogers .
3380,154,agent_1,"that is true , he is pretty prime time . he ism y quarterback gor my fantasy football team , i can't bt against him"
3381,154,agent_2,"lol ! did you know that one of them ost exensivbe high school football stadiums was built in allen , tx ?"
3382,154,agent_1,"o read that in sn article , how much was it ? that is a waste of money in my opinion !"
3383,154,agent_2,it was 60 jillion . i know that is a ton o fmoney ! did you also know that sno0p dgg wrote a fight song for his son's football team ?
3384,154,agent_1,"wow that id so much money ! i rid not know about snoop , i wawnt to hear it . i will go chexk it out now . have an amazing day friend !"
3385,155,agent_1,asre you a big nfl fan ?
3386,155,agent_2,i sm . i like watching football even thought he games only have an average of 11 minutes of live game play .
3387,155,agent_1,"i have heard that ebrore , it's crazy to think of that . i guess most of tghe time is spent moving the chains , and player , and coaches ."
3388,155,agent_2,yeah . i think the technology for marking the first down line is pretty amazing . espn won an emmy for creating the yellow line we see on tv .
3389,155,agent_1,"really ? i didn't know tht , very interestin . ig uess that does help a lot with the viewers ."
3390,155,agent_2,yeah . technology is huge in football . the nlf now uses tracking chips in sholder ads to record playerm ovement on the fiel . they also track ball movement .
3391,155,agent_1,"yeha i can see them doing that . i know they are tracking a lot more whne it fomes to hittin gtoo , the helmets i hink have trackers ."
3392,155,agent_2,i would have liked to be the engineer who designed the tracking chips . did you know that the average engineer makes more in a lifetime than the average nfl player ?
3393,155,agent_1,"wow , i would never havse guessedt hat about them ,"
3394,155,agent_2,yeah . in the 60's the top bowlers made twice as much asthe top footbal; stars ! crazy !
3395,155,agent_1,no way thwat's crazy . i guess the dream job would be pr5o bowler in the 60's lol !
3396,155,agent_2,that would be crazy . imagine if we had fatnayl eagues for pro bowling . we do have fantasy drafts for the national spelling hbee !
3397,155,agent_1,"htat would b etoo funny , and really , that is prettyy unbelievable . i guess 5there is a fantasy comic who has been knight6ed ."
3398,155,agent_2,"that would be awesome to be knighted . there was once a janutor from chicago who wrote a 15 ,1 45 page fantasy manuscript over six years . that guy deserves to be knighted ."
3399,155,agent_1,wow yeah that is the guy hat should have been . are you into the lord of the rings fantasy novel s?
3400,155,agent_2,not really . i have the mon my list to rea dand watch . i did enjoy the harry potter fantasies .
3401,155,agent_1,i have not read those but have read half of the tolkien fantasy novels .
3402,155,agent_2,that's cool . it's crazy to think that a single fold in the brain makes the difference in our perception sof reality and fantasy . tolken must have had a very tight fold !
3403,155,agent_1,"that is a crazy idea , and yeah he muast have !"
3404,155,agent_2,"if you could write a fantssy novel , would it be based on oral traditions or would it likely be vased on more modeen media ?"
3405,155,agent_1,"i think traditions , modern media ie pretty gross if you ask me . i like old time stuff better myself ."
3406,155,agent_2,i agree . have a great nihht !
3407,156,agent_1,o you watch the nfl ?
3408,156,agent_2,o do watch the nfl . j watch the super bowl . what about you ?
3409,156,agent_1,"i watched it , i thougnt it was boring this year . did you know that espn won an emmy for the 1st down makret you see on tv ?"
3410,156,agent_2,wow that's crazy . i d9n't know if that's worth it any but it is certainly useful . i do like t5he patriots and i guess that they have a running back was never fumbled the ball . they should give him the ball evdry time . ora tl east i would haha
3411,156,agent_1,"yeha , me too . hilarious , but you know there is only 1 1minutes of live gameplay during a full amed ;"
3412,156,agent_2,well ljiek you said the super bowl was really boring this year so that kind of does not surporise em haha another boringg ame would be the highest scoring foobtalpl game ever . it was 222 to 0 haha
3413,156,agent_1,vrqzy ! did you know the nfl uses tracking chips in players shoulder pads ?
3414,156,agent_2,that actually scared me . i'm sure they yet a lot of great stats that they can hse like the rotation of he ball . but i just hope that they keep it in the game and they don't pu tit on actualc itizens lke you or me
3415,156,agent_1,"yeah , i wonder if it is teh nfl collecting it o the temas thesmelves to optimize plays ."
3416,156,agent_2,but it's both honestly . what are your thoughts on the new orleans szints cheerleaders being forbdd4n from eating in the same restaurant as an nfl player ?
3417,156,agent_1,i think a lot f teams actually have that . the redskins have one too where players can't fdraternizew ith the cheer5leaders .
3418,156,agent_2,oh i didcn't know that . it seems very outdate dbut i guess they might have a reason for it . do you know any egnineers that you're friends with ?
3419,156,agent_1,"yeah , i'm one and i have a bunch of friendd tjat do it . on average we make more than a football player !"
3420,156,agent_2,"oh that's awesome . and yp that is what i have geard did you know that the nfl has no rule againstf emlae players . do you think we'll see ones in our lifeti,e ?"
3421,156,agent_1,"i've heard taht before , but i don't know if americans can stomach seeing a woman vetting injured o teh tield ."
3422,156,agent_2,that's ag ood poin tthat i never thought about . what i salso interestign to me i sthat an nfl game only has about 10 or 11 minutes to it thqt seems super low .
3423,156,agent_1,"yeahu , that makes sense , it is mostly standing around if you aslk me . i still love the game , but the clock watching gets annoying ."
3424,156,agent_2,yep i agree with htat . do you watch any fantasy mogies . or o you do fantasy football at all
3425,156,agent_1,"i used to play fantas football , but i no longer have the time for it t be honest . whyat about you ?"
3426,156,agent_2,i never played fantasy football but i did bear that they have fantasy national spellign bee and apso fantasg confress that seems so stupid haha
3427,156,agent_1,"weird , i wonder how tey rate the players ahead of time ? well nice chatting with you !"
3428,157,agent_1,do you like football ?
3429,157,agent_2,"i do watch some once in a whilse , you ?"
3430,157,agent_1,ih ave a passing knowledge . how fmailiar are you with the sport ?
3431,157,agent_2,"i kn9w some of the basics , but i also knowt hat there is really only 11 minutes of active game play . crazy seeing how long the games are ."
3432,157,agent_1,"i agree . it is also interesting how they have no rhulea gainst female players ? however , i wonder if the eligibility reqauirements inherently disqualify them ?"
3433,157,agent_2,"they might , or just make it so they wont want to play . i meawn i think anyone who is good e4nough hould be eligible to play . but i can iamgiune many women who would want to go up againsy3 00 pound linemen"
3434,157,agent_1,it is a dnagerous sporyt and i dont' think footbalo is as develope a spot for women comparatively to m9st others ports
3435,157,agent_2,i would agree t hey even have chips in shoulderpads to record moves of plqyers and with that they can see how hard tgey get hit .
3436,157,agent_1,"i heard they also put chips in the fotballs themselves 5to gather data onv elocity , rotation , speed , and location"
3437,157,agent_2,"yeah , with that do you think it could laso help determine reviews ? like use that data to say where the ball was or wanst at any given poit ."
3438,157,agent_1,tha ti am not sure sinfe i am not sure how much of that at ais effective real time
3439,157,agent_2,"the yellow line sjre helped things develop in terms of home viewerhsip , so much so that espn won an emmy for it"
3440,157,agent_1,true . it p4obablym ade things much more dijgextible for the gendra laudience and promoted its popularity
3441,157,agent_2,did you know that th ehighest scoring and biggest spread was in a game in 1916 ?
3442,157,agent_1,i imagine i ywas at least hundreds apart ?
3443,157,agent_2,"2220 , i dont even ses how that is possible . that one team must have been really bad ."
3444,157,agent_1,perhaps a combination of the winning team being just thatg ood and the losin gteam being so bad
3445,157,agent_2,"ive seen some blow outs ,b ut never by that much ."
3446,157,agent_1,did you every play fantasy footbla l?
3447,157,agent_2,"u never have , but my brother gets seriously into it ."
3448,157,agent_1,"ah well i would recommend it . in any case , thahks for chatt8ing ."
3449,158,agent_1,i never knew the nfl was the highest professional level of football int he world . did you ?
3450,158,agent_2,i did . the 17 week regula5 season is my favorite sports season .
3451,158,agent_1,do yo watch fthe playoffs ?
3452,158,agent_2,i do ? there are four divisionw inners for each conference that advance to hte playoffs . the ravens are my favorite tem .
3453,158,agent_1,interesting . i udnerstand that compuger chips are used to track movements of players and the ball . that is really high tech .
3454,158,agent_2,"i know . not like it usedf to be . i knew they were in the bal l, but didn't know they were in the soulrder pads of the players ."
3455,158,agent_1,so are wimen allower to play ?
3456,158,agent_2,"yes , but none hzve met the league's eligiblity requirements as of et ."
3457,158,agent_1,i wonder what the requirements are . ih ave watched a super bowl evrery now an dthen and those are good .
3458,158,agent_2,"i do as welpl .w hat else is ther to do on the first sunday in debruary ? they are , bu ti l,ike the playoffs more . more of an emphasis on the game and not so much on the show ."
3459,158,agent_1,i never thought abouyt it but that's true . it does seem to play up the commercials and half time performancew .
3460,158,agent_2,"very much so . there is a game betweent he champions of the nfc and afc , but alot of times the playoff game saret he beter ones ."
3461,158,agent_1,when do the playoffs start ?
3462,158,agent_2,"htis weekend , my favorite team , tne raven's , plan on sunday ."
3463,158,agent_1,whp do they play ? ik now there re two conferences . whihc ine are they in ?
3464,158,agent_2,"they play in the afc and play the chargers this weekend . the cheerleaders have been around town jhy7ping the game , but they usually cannot hand ou twith the players ."
3465,158,agent_1,are there rules against that ?
3466,158,agent_2,yes .t he saints chee4leaders cannot even eat in the same restauranf as the players .
3467,158,agent_1,i guess if is to keep the players from gettking distracted or from bad press baout teams .
3468,158,agent_2,"i'm sure . even if the cheerleader is alreaxy there , if a player walks into the restaurant the cheerleader has to leave ."
3469,158,agent_1,that's pretty strict .
3470,159,agent_1,"i remembe rjj wat caleld andy dalto nthe little red bvg un with his arm , he the worst quarterback ih the afc north"
3471,159,agent_2,"don't know much about football , you say he was the worst quart4rbacdk . hwo was thr best ?"
3472,159,agent_1,"i would have to sy it 2as the baltimore raven's rookie qb lamar jackson seeing as how he wasw the only one in the division to get his team to the playoffs . but i can admit , i';m biased"
3473,159,agent_2,htat's cook i remember seeing the cleveland brows play once how's there qb ?
3474,159,agent_1,baker mayfield ? he's good . . i beliwve clevleand would have actually made the playoffs if he had started the whole season but i believe they named him the starter after liek 6 weeks
3475,159,agent_2,i heard that the iowa universitieds looker room is painted pink for the visiting team .
3476,159,agent_1,really ?t hat's pretty interesting but if i was the opposite team that would just make me more angry on fhe field lol the defense and pass rushers are probably on the field trying to knock their heads off
3477,159,agent_2,right i feel tfhe same way ! ! di dyouk now that in the 60's top bowlers mad twice as much a snfl players ?
3478,159,agent_1,"wow , when you think about how muc hthe top earners in the nfl make today that's almost mind blow8ing . that almost as crazy as leople fantasy drafting the national spelling bee ."
3479,159,agent_2,yeah know that is crazy . what about fantqsy congress .
3480,159,agent_1,where players draft members of congress and base the points off legislative success ? that s0unds so boring in comparison to fantasy sports and i reakly dpn't even know ho wyou would gauge ' legislative sccess '
3481,159,agent_2,"well if we believe that a signle fold in the brain makes the difference3 between perceiving reality and fantasy then who know , lol !"
3482,159,agent_1,"haha crazy but true . . do you think we'll ever see a female pkayer int he nfl ? to my surprise , they are allkwrd to play as long as they meet the eligibility requirmdnets ."
3483,159,agent_2,yeah i heard tha tand am surprised we haven't yet . personally i think they shoudl just have their own leagie like the wnba .
3484,159,agent_1,"that would actually be p4etty cool and i may enjoy watcing that better than then fl lol they should be allowed to ve more than just cheerleaders , especially for the new orleans saints . the saints cheerleaders can't even eat in the same 4stablishment as an nfl player and they even would have to get up and leave if one entered after them . . . sounds like throwback jim crow laws"
3485,159,agent_2,"don't start , lol ! however that id very sexist . on a lighter note did you hear about a janitor that wrote everyday over six years . 15 , 145 pages ?"
3486,159,agent_1,"yeah thats; very ikpressive , i wish he would have been alive to see his work discovered . i wonder what ever became of the works ? hopefully it was created ahd his fam9ly received the proceeds ."
3487,159,agent_2,that would be the right thing to do . did you know that espn won a nemmy award ?
3488,159,agent_1,"yeah i figured tha tas the worl dwide leader in zports , but i had no idea it was for creating the first down marker superimposed in our televisions in yello2 . that yellowl ine definitely makes the came more enjoyable and easy to follow at times . so well deserved lol"
3489,159,agent_2,i agree my friend . so the nfl merged wit hthe afl after being formed in 1920 as the aemrican football league .
3490,159,agent_1,yes one oft he greatest and most profitahle mergers of all time . . . i bet they never imagined the game would expand to have 32 teams
3491,159,agent_2,yeah humble beginnings . you kn9ow there is a rbw ho has never fumbled the ball in his career ?
3492,159,agent_1,"yes , i remember watching greenellis play . he wasn't too syabby . well i enjoyed al,king to you , i learned a few things ."
3493,160,agent_1,do you watch football much ?
3494,160,agent_2,"i sure do ! wifh 32 teams in the nfl it is on all the time at ,y place !"
3495,160,agent_1,"cor sure , do you hgave a favorite of the 32 ?"
3496,160,agent_2,i really just like them all ! can you belie4ve the nfl's rulea bo7t females ?
3497,160,agent_1,"what is their rule , i don't think they hve rules towards females fo thy ?"
3498,160,agent_2,you are right ! they have nl rule against females playing as long aws they can meet the league'se ligibility requirements .
3499,160,agent_1,"nicd , i wonder why we have never seen that before . i hearrt he saints have a rule regarding their female cheerleaders , kind of sexist , have you heard of it ?"
3500,160,agent_2,"yes , if you are talking about the rulew ehre cheerleaders are forbidde nto eat in the same restaurant as ann fl player ."
3501,160,agent_1,"yea that one , that is so weird . i don't understand it , what are your thoughts ?"
3502,160,agent_2,"i wonder why it was made ,s o what if a cheerleadwr and a playe are married ? then what ?"
3503,160,agent_1,"boom , mind blown ! lol i wonder if it was an odl rule back in the day , at least i hope so"
3504,160,agent_2,"i know ! but who knows . so , can you believe tha5 the average lifetime earnings of an engineer is more than an nfl player ?"
3505,160,agent_1,"that is crazy , but believable , nfl careers tend to be short . the negineers makec hips to yrack daa and deserve more money"
3506,160,agent_2,"yes , yu are right ? they nfl even uses dta chips !"
3507,160,agent_1,"wow , i wonder wha tthey tfack , do you know ?"
3508,160,agent_2,they use tracking chips in tne players shoulder pads and in the footablls .
3509,160,agent_1,"dot hey track like velocity , rotation , and their every move ?"
3510,160,agent_2,"yes , that is exactly ijt . that must relaly help mae for some detaild game plans !"
3511,160,agent_1,i agree . have you ever heard of benjarvus green ellis ?
3512,160,agent_2,the name ring a bell . was he a patriot ?
3513,160,agent_1,yep and a begnal i think .h en ever fumbled once in his career !
3514,160,agent_2,wow ! that's quite an accomplishment . what positonh did he plqy ?
3515,160,agent_1,"he was a running back . he had a lot of carries too so thst was amaang , it was so nice chatting with you !"
3516,161,agent_1,do you keep up with the nfl at all ?
3517,161,agent_2,"yea , i fo,low it like everyday . it's interesting how todd gurley signed a 45 million extension with the rams and then ended up injured"
3518,161,agent_1,especially sone gurley is a rb . that'z the largest guarantee for that position
3519,161,agent_2,"yea , i wonder ho wmuch that influenced le'von bell not to sign with the steelers"
3520,161,agent_1,"i guess the lifespan fod runnign backs isn't very long , and some think bell may only hav eone or two more easeons left . the deal he was offered is a five year deal"
3521,161,agent_2,"i heard bell wanted 17 million a season , i wouldn't want to do that for five years"
3522,161,agent_1,most start to decline in skill once they reach 27 . quarterbacks have a longer lifes0pan in the nfl
3523,161,agent_2,"yea ,a lex smith said heh ad a lot of years left but that was before his injury"
3524,161,agent_1,it's amazing how many injuries ofcur i na game that really only has about 11 minute sof gameplay
3525,161,agent_2,"yea , i bet the ijjuries us s major reason why engineers make more on avedrage than nfl players in their lifetume"
3526,161,agent_1,it might also be why qwe don't see women playing in the nfl despite there not being a rule preventing it
3527,161,agent_2,7yea but i can see a womna pla6int at place kicker one day
3528,161,agent_1,i've heard 5hat might be happening . she probanly wouldn't mind the pink visitor's lockers at the university of iowa
3529,161,agent_2,"well there are female bowlers , i wonder if they made mo0re than the top football star sin the 1960s"
3530,161,agent_1,"if they did , television proably ruined that fo4 them , especiallyw hen the game became easier to understand with the yellow firstd own line created by espn . they deserved the emmy for that one"
3531,161,agent_2,yea i'm surprised no on ethought of 6he yellow first down line sooner than espn
3532,161,agent_1,true . i wonder who came up with the ida to embed chips in the footbgalls and shoulder pads for rsecord data . it probably paved thew ay for fantasy f0otball

3567,163,agent_2,i bet so too . did you know espn won an emmy once ?
3568,163,agent_1,yeah they won it for the superimposed yellow line

3575,163,agent_2,yeah that is pretty short and yet we are glued to the tv for hours
3576,163,agent_1,tell me about it . engineers make more over their lifetime than football players .
3577,163,agent_2,i guess that makes sense since tbey have longer careers ove rthe lifetime
3578,163,agent_1,hat is actually a really good point . nice chat .
3579,164,agent_1,"he.lo here , are you a fan of th enfl ?"
3580,164,agent_2,"hi ! yes , i really enjoy watching ll forms of sports though i'm not too familiar with fnatasy footblal , are you ?"
3581,164,agent_1,"i a m, but i just started playing recently , i think fantasy baseball is the most fun surprisingly ."
3582,164,agent_2,why is it surprisingly fun ? do the same number of players play on the field as does the real game ?
3583,164,agent_1,"i am not as much into baseball as i am the other sports , but it makes the game a lot more fun to follow . you have teh same number of offensive players i think , and then like 6 spots for pitching ."
3584,164,agent_2,"oh sorry , i think im eant fantasy football but thanks for clarifying , i'm not familiar wiht baseball at all as i am with football . if rb benjarvus greenellis had broken his nonfumble record dring the superbowl , i th9n ktheg ame would've been more entertaining to warch ."
3585,164,agent_1,yeah the super bowl htis ye3ar was prettu much a dud from the fans' perspective . last years was much better .
3586,164,agent_2,"i couldn't agree more , though i think people who participated in sports betting would've enjoyedt his year's game a lot more htan last year ."
3587,164,agent_1,"that you are probably rigut about . speaking of fotball , do you know what the highest scoring gfame pro or collete ever was ?"
3588,164,agent_2,"i don't know what the highests cre was , but if o had to take a guess , would it be in the seventies ?"
3589,164,agent_1,i guess it was 2220 ! in a college gme georgia tech beat cumberland .
3590,164,agent_2,thatm ust've been as log timwe ago because i don't remember eeing anything on the news or social media discuassing thaqt . i'd imagine feeds would be flooded with jokes at the team ! i would also be surprised if female playees played in the nfl because there's no rules against it .
3591,164,agent_1,yeah i'm sure it was a long time wago . i thino that would be veruyc ool if a female player would make a team .
3592,164,agent_2,"yeha , i would love tos ee that though i'd imagine they would hav4e to bee xtremely buff to survive a tackle from those professional linebackers !"
3593,164,agent_1,"yeah and be very fast , but it coudl happen , i know there are girls out there trying to make it ."
3594,164,agent_2,"yeah , that'll be a big step above how the saints treat their cheerleaders because they are forbidden from eatin gin the same restauran tas the players ."
3595,164,agent_1,"i read that , i think that rule is pretty outdatd and rather silly to be honest ."
3596,164,agent_2,"yeah i agree , do you have any clue o rtheories as to why htey initiated that rule in the first place ?"
3597,164,agent_1,"who knows , they probably don't watn them dating the cheerleade from the team , but that's just q random thought ."
3598,164,agent_2,"yeah ,t hat'z a good theory . i can't think of any but i wonder what color the university of iowa's cheerleader's locker room is painted since they painted teu visitor's locker rooms completely pink ."
3599,164,agent_1,yeah isn?'t that 0retty funny ? i wonde rhwo was in charge that gave the final ok for them to paint it that way .
3600,164,agent_2,"has to be the head coach whenever the opposing tem's coach made him angry so to get back at thme , that's what they did to get in their heads ."
3601,165,agent_1,aree you a fan of football ?
3602,165,agent_2,"i am , i like college andn fl . what zbout hou ?"
3603,165,agent_1,i sm . did you know the highest score was 2220 ?
3604,165,agent_2,"yeah , didn't georgia tech beat cumberland that bad ?"
3605,165,agent_1,"yeah , that was the game . crazy , right ?"
3606,165,agent_2,yeah it is . i wonder if cumberlan deven pu tup a fight ?
3607,165,agent_1,guess you had to be htere to know !
3608,165,agent_2,i wonder if they painted their visitor locker room pink like university of iowa ? that'd make me want to bneat somebody that bad . haha
3609,165,agent_1,would you consider that cheating ?
3610,165,agent_2,it's not cheating if it works against you .
3611,165,agent_1,that's true ! did you know bowlers in the 60s made more than nfl stwrs .
3612,165,agent_2,tghat's crazy to think . i'm sure it's the other waya round bi gtime now . but they do say that engineers lifetime earnings is higher t6han the lifetime earnings of zn nfl player .
3613,165,agent_1,i can believe that . i think some players don't p;ay that lon or make that much .
3614,165,agent_2,they say the average career is 3 . 3 years for an nfl player . that's kind of interesting seeing a sso many players ahvs long careersz .
3615,165,agent_1,"well , gameplay is only 11 minutes as welk ."
3616,165,agent_2,it;s crazg that it takes almost 3 hours for 11m inutes of gameply .
3617,165,agent_1,"exactly , usually mor4e than 3 hours to be honest . lol"
3618,165,agent_2,that is grue . maybe they should get som efema;le players out there . they could speed things up . there's np rule against them player angways .
3619,165,agent_1,"yeah , there were female players in high school . anyways , nice chatting with you !"
3620,165,agent_2,i remebmer paying with some asw ell .
3621,165,agent_1,"yea , threre were a few in my high shool league . have a good evening ."
3622,165,agent_2,i hope you have a good evening too l.
3623,166,agent_1,"hi , how are you ? do you follow football ?"
3624,166,agent_2,"i do , it's myf avorite sport . do hyou ?"
3625,166,agent_1,i somerimes follow it . around playoffs . did you hear that the university of iowa's lockerr oom for visitign foobtall teams is painted pink ?
3626,166,agent_2,"i di d, i wonder f htey think that will throw off their opponent ?"
3627,166,agent_1,i guesst hat's the idea . i can't imagine it real.ly working or everyone would do i t.
3628,166,agent_2,"yeah i think it must be more of a tradition now , i doubt a color would really affect another team's performance ."
3629,166,agent_1,"teh highest score ever in a ootball game occurred in 1916 when georgia tecnh defeated cumberland 2202 . would pink loker rooms have helped cumberland , do you think ?"
3630,166,agent_2,i don't think anything would have ehlpedc umberland that day . probably onl a freak hurricane .
3631,166,agent_1,"in the 60s' top bowlers mae twice as much as top football stars . i wonder how much they actuall,y made though ."
3632,166,agent_2,i know that some 0f the players for my favorite tema in th e60's had offseason jobs .
3633,166,agent_1,i've hear dfhat too . now they need to learn tkm anage money . an average nfl game only has 11 minutes of live gameplay . that seems short to me .
3634,166,agent_2,tehy ahve to fit in all those ads ! sometimes i like to watch hockey or basketball live more because of that .
3635,166,agent_1,that's true . the ads take up a lot of time in nfl tv gamee .
3636,166,agent_2,especially during the super bowl . threy charge millions ofd ollars for those ads !
3637,166,agent_1,quite true . the fans in th estands have to wait for the game to start up again .
3638,166,agent_2,"sometimes there are videos , songs , or ;resentations in the stadium during those stoppages . if not , it woudl be super boring ."
3639,166,agent_1,i imagine it would be . it might be interesting to see women in fhe game . the nfl has no written rule agazinst female players
3640,166,agent_2,"i would be worried that they would ge6 seriouwly hur t, there are over 300 pound men playing some of those positions . those hits have to do some major damage ."
3641,166,agent_1,true . 11 minutes of combat .
3642,166,agent_2,"i'm all for women break9ing barriers and the believ that they can accomplis hanything a man can , but not hn there is a chance for major ijury just based n a size advantage ."
3643,166,agent_1,"true . anyway , i enjoyed chatting with you !"
3644,166,agent_2,"so did i , have a great day !"
3645,167,agent_1,"hello , do you ik efantasy ?"
3646,167,agent_2,hsllo . i really o . it is some of my favorite genre of books . do you like it ?
3647,167,agent_1,i do as well . i also like fantasy sports . do you play any fantasy sports ?
3648,167,agent_2,no i never really got into fantasy sports . to be honest i'm not realpy sure how they work . do people pick someone off stats or based on the teams ?
3649,167,agent_1,ye pretty much . i love playing fnatasy football . did you know there is a fantasy national spelling bee ?
3650,167,agent_2,now that is a fantasy team i could see myelf making . or the one where they do the fantasy congress . i don't think i'm knowledgabel enough to do the soorts ones . i just watch for fun sometimes .
3651,167,agent_1,haha that would be a fun one to playw ith congress . did you know a sinlge fold in the brain is what makes the diffwrence between reality and fantasy ?
3652,167,agent_2,the human body relaly is ar emarkable thing . just hink that one fold allowed a humble janitor to write an mazing fantasy masterpiece . i would love to read that .
3653,167,agent_1,"i would love reading that too . it was1 5 , 145 pages long . taht would take me a long time to read lo l."
3654,167,agent_2,tru e. i think a few hundred pages are illustrations though so that helps . they should publish it ins everalb ooks and see what the public things ? i sounds fascinating .
3655,167,agent_1,that does sound r4ally cool to check out . do you like football ?
3656,167,agent_2,i don't mind 9t . i live in football country so it is hard to avoid . i don't have a particular team to root for but it is fun to watch sometimes . do you watch a lot ?
3657,167,agent_1,i love football . iowa painted their opposijg team locker rom pik .
3658,167,agent_2,that aounds like a very iowa thing . ther eis a huge rivalry between the college teams in iowa . i could see them doing it to try and intimidate the other team in some way .
3659,167,agent_1,the average cn.l game is only 11 minutes of wctual live gameplay .
3660,167,agent_2,it really seems like it should be longer tahn that but i supppse there is the huddles and waiting for the snapo . did you know thate s;n actually got an award for the creatin of the yellow lin eon the field image ?
3661,167,agent_1,i did see that about espn . i love that yellow line . i don't know what i wuld do without it .
3662,167,agent_2,yeah it really makes it easier fo rthe viewers to follow along at home . that ws a well deserved award .
3663,167,agent_1,defihnitely . tge nfl has no written rule against women playing in the league .
3664,167,agent_2,it mihgt not be a written rule bug the requiremetns are so out there that no woman is ever going to be anything mo5e thah a cheerleader on a pro team . and usually not a well treated one ast that especially in new orleans .
3665,167,agent_1,"for sure . i could see them being a kicker one day . well , it was good chatting . take care ."
3666,168,agent_1,hey did yo know th enfl has no rule against female players ?
3667,168,agent_2,"smart move , no law suitzs that wouedl be obvious and easy to pursue ."
3668,168,agent_1,"ya that isst rue , do you think e'll ever see one ? i thonk its lpossible in our lifetime"
3669,168,agent_2,"i just szy soething about gilr who is trying to t7rn pro . it sseems a stretch , maybe as a kicker or punter ."
3670,168,agent_1,"ya i could see tha t, do you watch the nfl ? a game actually only has about 11 mins of actual gameplay apparently"
3671,168,agent_2,i jus twatc ha few games here and there .n ot so excited to see a bunch of millionair3s play a gaem . how about you ?
3672,168,agent_1,"ya i don't watch any sports but i watched tne superbow , did you hea rabou the weird rule the nfl has for saints cheerleads ?"
3673,168,agent_2,that is such a wierd rule . i wonder what the reason is ? no hanky panky ?
3674,168,agent_1,"lol , must be yes to prevent that sort of thing , i"
3675,168,agent_2,not sure an engineer makes more than an nfl player .
3676,168,agent_1,"ya i thinkt hat was valculated over their lkfetime , an nfl player makes a lot but only plays until age 40 or so"
3677,168,agent_2,its funny that tghey have chips in the playeds sholder pads .
3678,168,agent_1,"ya that is crazy , i'm just hopeful they never make citizens wear thos e, thats too much information to share !"
3679,168,agent_2,do you do any fantasy football ?
3680,168,agent_1,"i don't actually , but i id see that people will do fantasy everything , even spelling bees !"
3681,168,agent_2,they were actually betting on how many times they would say gronk in the super bowl ; mayge not a fanatasy league but a wierd sports related fact .
3682,168,agent_1,"haha that is weird , do you do any fantasy stuff ? i guess people also do fantasy politics"
3683,168,agent_2,"i don't just don't have the passiln for it , you ?"
3684,168,agent_1,"no i don't , nad i just don't care about sports personally haha , have you read anythoing abou tterry pratchett ?"
3685,168,agent_2,"i have not read aboutt err pracgett , whats up with him ?"
3686,168,agent_1,"well apparently he was knighted , he writes fantasy comedy novles ,a nd so if he was knighted then i would assume his work must be good !"
3687,168,agent_2,i anm not sure about that some people who have been knghted are real losers in my nook .
3688,168,agent_1,"haha like who ? one guy hwo is not a loser is the benjarvus greenellis , he has never fumbled a football !"
3689,169,agent_1,are you a football fan ? do you follow nf lor do fantasy football ?
3690,169,agent_2,no mot really . how bout yourself ? are you a redskins fan ?
3691,169,agent_1,don't really followf otball until the plyoffs . not really a redskins fan . surprised they still have changed their name .
3692,169,agent_2,"i think they aret alking about i t, but haven't made a decision yet . apparently the cleve,land browns are pretty bad too ."
3693,169,agent_1,"the browns are known for a terribl edefense . i wonder 9if they paint their locker ropm walls brown for inspiration . if so , it ain't wokring ."
3694,169,agent_2,": , trent williams is leading the offensive line for the redskisn this seaso ."
3695,169,agent_1,how has he done ? should i have put money on the 'skins ?
3696,169,agent_2,"not really well apparently , his running average is terrible ! could you imagine a women's football team ? would youw atch that ?"
3697,169,agent_1,"i think jtey've had league with women , but they are running around in skkmpy uniform s. i would rather have women in the nfl ."
3698,169,agent_2,"me too . that was like tuhe lingerie league or somehing , right ? i wonder ifw omen could take the impact of a tackl elike men can ?"
3699,169,agent_1,"i suppose it depends on the woman , but i expect that women woul db ekickers , punters , etc ? not much contact ."
3700,169,agent_2,i'm sure they wold use the tracking chips on the women like they do the men to find out . but i ikagine the women would need to play like hte mwn too .
3701,169,agent_1,fhat woul be interesting to compare men and women and their movement on the field . it wpuld be funn to see male cheerleade5rs too .
3702,169,agent_2,it would ! hten maybe they would have to leave the restaurant when the women came ib !
3703,169,agent_1,i still don't know what that accomplishes for the no saints . is it supposed to prevent romance ;
3704,169,agent_2,"that and probably problems between thr two . if they got rowdy together , it mitht be a problem . have you ever watched the national spelling bee ?"
3705,169,agent_1,"no , haven't watch4d it ."
3706,169,agent_2,apparently peopel fantasy draft it too !
3707,169,agent_1,"i guess i fthere' sa way to gamble , people wil lfind it . i wonder how much you can win ."
3708,169,agent_2,i have no idea . there is a fantasy congress too ! hat ? !
3709,169,agent_1,great chat !
3710,170,agent_1,hey you do any fantasy football ? what do you7 think abut berkley
3711,170,agent_2,i do not normally play but he is making a combeack in the ff circles
3712,170,agent_1,"well barclay was hte second pick in the 2018 drqft , so i know he's really good , do you think he's gouing to put up s lot of yards this year ?"
3713,170,agent_2,he id well at penn state as a juniors o hopefully h will be albe to keep that up in the nfl
3714,170,agent_1,"yeah i hope so ue seems very promising , also hia workload should be minimal which i think will give him a lo tiof possibilities"
3715,170,agent_2,i like the nfl a lot it is cu5ious that in the 60's bowlers made more money than nfl players !
3716,170,agent_1,"shocking ! i never would have thought 5hat , what do you thinka bout the highest scoring football game of all time ?"
3717,170,agent_2,2220 ! i would have left after the first quarter !
3718,170,agent_1,me too ! especilaly if i were rooting for cumberland that is quite a loss lol
3719,170,agent_2,yes and baxk in 1o916 thrre was not even our magicap yellow line
3720,170,agent_1,"nope tha tmight have actually helped the mout haha . maybe they woul dnot have lost so badly , it was definitely worth giving espn an emmy for creatingt hat"
3721,170,agent_2,i love ho my school iowa paints hte visiting team's lockerr ooj pink just tl screw with teh other team
3722,170,agent_1,"gaha thsat is funny . did you go to that school ? i love the patriots , and i pesonally love thst one of their players has never fumbled the ball , that's so god"
3723,170,agent_2,yes he is amazingly good . the nfl only has 11 minute sof live gameplay so that ks not that muc tije per game
3724,170,agent_1,"not a lot of time at all ! what is shocking tom e though is that females can actually play for hte nfl , there is no rule against it"
3725,170,agent_2,yes as a kid i always wanfed to play on the nfl or the ml bgut ring a tiny girl nver quite mde the team ! luckily my career as a nengineer will oay jme more over the long run
3726,170,agent_1,well that's good ebcause you?ll make more over your lifetime ! what do you think avout how the saints treat cheerleaders though ? my friend was a cheerleader in college an h3 would not have appreciated having to leave a restauratn if a player entered
3727,170,agent_2,oh for sure .; that is very rude ! they would never allow a femael palyer . i do like what the nlf is doing with trackign chips however .
3728,170,agent_1,"yes it is interrsting . they csm track the speed rotation qnd location of the balls and also of the players , very technologically wdvanced"
3729,170,agent_2,yes did you watch the super bowl on th efirst sudnay in february ? it wa srather bor8ng this year
3730,170,agent_1,"yes j agree it as really bvoring . they should have added sme fantasy into it , do you ever do fantasy football by the way ? or fantasy spelling bee for that matter haha"
3731,171,agent_1,are you a fan of the nfl ?
3732,171,agent_2,"yeah , pretty much ! one thig i don't understand is why they have to trade team members . it just kind of ruins it for md , or at least makes it hard to stay loya lto any one team . you ?"

3735,171,agent_1,"nice go seahawks ! they coul dbe wors6 , my team is the vikings , purple and gold !"
3736,171,agent_2,"heh , , wooo extravagant colors ! the former patriots running back benarvs greenellis has never fumbed th efootball in his entire career !"
3737,171,agent_1,"that is an amazing feat ! he needs to coach the new rb how to play , they alwaysf umble !"
3738,171,agent_2,i wonder what the diffetence is now . i heard that in the 6s't op blwpers made twice as much monyaz s the top football sars ! crazy !
3739,171,agent_1,"that is so diffrrent these days , i wonder what the difference in pay is now . probably so much . do you like college football ?"
3740,171,agent_2,i've never really been into college footbqall . i guess if i had to choose a team it would be ' the ujnlv rebels ' . what about you ?
3741,171,agent_1,"i never kenw they had a team . i am an iowa hawkeye fan , they paint their visiting locker rooms pink"
3742,171,agent_2,haha ! well that's not very nice of them ! kind of funny though !
3743,171,agent_1,"for sure , i think it deals with psychklogy and psyhcig the other team out into a calming mood , pretty crazy stuff right there"
3744,171,agent_2,"yeah that's realy interesting ! i should paint myh ouse pink to attem,pt to clam myself . hwha . did you know that people fantasy draft the national apelling bee ?"
3745,171,agent_1,"lo l need to also . i did not know that aout the spelling bee , 8i wondr how that works . do you play fantasy anything ?"
3746,171,agent_2,"no , i never have ! have you ? fantasy cong4ess is a thing !w here players draft members of congress and points are based off of legislarive success ! i can't imagine all of the fantasy drafts people will think up !"
3747,171,agent_1,"ha that is kind of a cool concept , but i think they need to focus on other things lol . i can understand them do8ng fantasy football m byt come on !"
3748,171,agent_2,"i know what'x next ? fantasy science and space exploratioj ! inter4esting fact , a single fold in the brain makes a difference between perceiving reality and fatnasy ! scaryh t think about tbi 9n that sense . one hit to the head and a person could be stuck in a fantasy world !"
3749,171,agent_1,"that would eb intnese to be in tbi from a hity o the head , i would want to get out . i ejoyed chatting with you 2"

3755,172,agent_2,"i am actulaly nolt a hige fan of footbal l, but i have learned in section 1 of the article to never take a kicker before the final rlund ."
3756,172,agent_1,that is in fantasy football whuer eyou draft ;layer and compete with you friends on wgo choose the best players . there is even a fantasy league for spelling bee .
3757,172,agent_2,"i see that now , thank you . i did notk now there was a fantwsy league for spelling bee either ."
3758,172,agent_1,"you ahve to reall know the children , or just choose the on3 fvrom your favorite state . i guess , it is the latter , i am not picturing people takig this seriously ."
3759,172,agent_2,"i think that soundd like a fun way to gmale ! i learne din section 3 the deshaun watson , he is a qb and streaked like a cojet !"
3760,172,agent_1,"people sometimes use artixles to choose their players , what makes him special ?"
3761,172,agent_2,"he racked up 1 , 472 passing yards and 18 tds in 5 games . than he endfed up tearing a ligament in his knee ."
3762,172,agent_1,"i thinks an injury would be bad for your fatnasy team , your friend might laug hat your injured player . do you read fantasy novels ?"
3763,172,agent_2,"no , i lersonally do not . i did read in this aeticle that a janitor from chicago wrotwe 15 , 145 pages over a six year period for his fantasy novel ."
3764,172,agent_1,"that is a great achievement , in chool i had trouble writing 2pages stories ."
3765,172,agent_2,"as did i , i was nev3r really that creative like the janitor was . if i am rading this rihgt , l0rd of the rings was the first and onlyf antasy film to win and academy award for best picture . i brought this up since it is a fantasy novel also ."
3766,172,agent_1,"did you saw it ? i saw it whne it first came out , it was hgood at the time , but i would not watch it again ."
3767,172,agent_2,"no i haven't and probably will not bothe rwatching it . i am not too fodn of fantasy novels , but there is a university that would let you study science fiction andf anjtasy literature ."
3768,172,agent_1,"why you don't like fantasy ? it is a very large field , from magic tos ciencefictin , books to video games , there is surely a subgenre that you tolerat e."
3769,172,agent_2,"i should take that back , i do like some . i like harry potter movies . i do not like fantasy enough to go to college for it though ."
3770,172,agent_1,"there you go , i knew that you could not hatee very fantasyrelate produce . i did read harry potter books but didn ot saw the films . were they good ?"
3771,172,agent_2,yes they are very good ! i recommend watching 6hem weun you have a chamce .
3772,172,agent_1,"thanks i think i will do that , have a nice day ."
3773,173,agent_1,you can't dispute that nfl is a leader when it comes to sports in north america
3774,173,agent_2,of course not
3775,173,agent_1,il ike the fact that the nfl alloes women rto join their league
3776,173,agent_2,they are totally aheqd of their time on that front . ut how about those cheerleaders having to leave the restaurants ?
3777,173,agent_1,i believe htart' sjust particular to new orleans saints cheerleaders and it's 2018 i'm sure it will be addressed
3778,173,agent_2,its hould be . although jt amaze sme why anyone would put tehir bodies through playing nfl . thats legitimatel painfu l.
3779,173,agent_1,"thigns happe n, well , im very shockee to know htat ttal lif4 savings o fan engineer can be more tha that of an nfl career player . sa d!"
3780,173,agent_2,"that's exactly what i was getting at doesn't sewm w9orth it at all . i gueass it's the glamour . i mean baseball , badketball and soccer a4e all great alteratives . what do you think ?"
3781,173,agent_1,ji agree with tou but i think it's high tim esomething is done about it
3782,173,agent_2,"i don't think that is evne possible , a lot of schoosl hqv eall thea lternative progr5ams bu american football gets all the glory ."
3783,173,agent_1,i kno2 qu6e sad . well at least fhere is something other sports like soccer can learn from nfl trackin gchips are embeded in players shoulder pads to rcord a pla7ers every move on the field
3784,173,agent_2,"that's kind of being done did you know the worldc up ball , soccer , has a chip embedded in it , it measures everything , power etc ."
3785,173,agent_1,swet . technolo9gy is doing a good job for sports
3786,173,agent_2,did uou know the highest score in soccer is 2220 ?
3787,173,agent_1,"wow , my head can't even imagine 40 is quite a blow already but 2220 ?"
3788,173,agent_2,haha yah . i'mc urious as to how 6that happened . maybe i'l google it later . do you partake i nfantasy leagues and sich ?
3789,173,agent_1,no i don't but curious
3790,173,agent_2,"i never have either , do you or did you play any of thesx ports w etalekd abouy ?"
3791,173,agent_1,i havea lways been a soccer person
3792,173,agent_2,really ? i playeds occer as a kid . guess waht position ?
3793,173,agent_1,"i played 7 and i was also a keepser at a point , good old memories"
3794,173,agent_2,i always played keep3r could control rhe ball worth a lick with my feet . but put me as a goalie and i'll makes ure that ball doesn't ;pass me .
3795,173,agent_1,hahaha . thanks for the chat buddy
3796,173,agent_2,"like wise , it was fun . take xare good bye"
3797,173,agent_1,cheers
3798,173,agent_2,cheers
3799,174,agent_1,hey there how often do youw atch foobtall ? i know that my favorite team is the patriots and i watch them when i can
3800,174,agent_2,"hi ! i ikd to watch occassionally buyt 9i find it a little too slow pacedc tor my liking . a,thouvh i believe the highest game on recorcd was somehow 2220 !"
3801,174,agent_1,yep yoj're right ! it was georgia tech meeting cumberland lol imagine how bad you would have felt if you were watching and you were on the side of cumberland lol
3802,174,agent_2,"okh absolutepy , i can imagie it's very demoralizing . i wodner wha'6s more d3emoraoizin g,t hagt or visiting unibersity od iowa . theyh ave their visiting locker room paintec pink ."
3803,174,agent_1,"yes i wohuld be very demoralized if that were the locker roomc olor when i walked in haha although i think i might actually play better but that's just me , what about you"
3804,174,agent_2,"oh i think i would have too haha . maybe back when it was paintrd peiple cared less about football , l8ke in the 1960s when even bowlers made more money ."
3805,174,agent_1,"yeah i think that bowlers made like twice as much as football stars actually , what eo tou think about espn winninga n emmy though ? theyw ant it back or creating the ytellow line that you see in football for firs tdowns , kind of wild"
3806,174,agent_2,"oh i didn't know that ! i think that's nice though , they certainlg deserve recognition for it . i know benjavus greeellis never fumbled the ball , i wonjder if he got an award for it too ."
3807,174,agent_1,"yeah he should definitely get an award . i like the patroots a lot fhough , so i'm glad that he plays for th4m lol what's your favorite football team ;"
3808,174,agent_2,oh mine are as well ! i used to like the sainbts but rver since finding out the way they treat their cheereladers it's sort of soured them for me .
3809,174,agent_1,"yeah i don't like that either . i think that cheerleaders sh9uldn't have to leave if a player walks into a restaudrant . that seems so outdated , what do you 6hink abojt the trakcign chips that use on the field by thew ay"
3810,174,agent_2,"oh it definitely is outdated , ands urprising considering women are technically allowed in the nfl !"
3811,174,agent_1,"yep i agree ! do you think wr'll ever see a woman in the nfl by the way ? you think that because theres only 1q minutes of live game;lay , it wouldn't be that hard to qualify to get into the nfl"
3812,174,agent_2,i think that's possible ! maybe that's why the average lifetime earnings of an engineer is higuher tahn those of an nfl plkayer .
3813,174,agent_1,yeah i can see tuat . i also think it's weir dthat they use tracking chips ont he filed . i don't know why they neerd to know about the rotation of balls that are thrown lol yo8'd think that they would just look at the footage as it plays back andt hat it would be enough
3814,174,agent_2,"ahah i definitely agree with you ther e, amybe they should spend less with technologcal innovation and focus on social issues . on anothrr note , are you inferested in fanasy at all ?"
3815,174,agent_1,"yes i like a little bit of fantasy myself . i know that people do stuff like national fantasy spelling beds , but i usually stick to just fantasy football"
3816,174,agent_2,"ahwhj me as well , but i've been truing to gst into it . i think it's nice being able to transport yourself into a fictional universe and go beyond traditional norsm ."
3817,174,agent_1,"yes i agree with you it's interesting to experience reality in different ways , kind of like if you are missing a fold in the bfain , then you can go from experienc esomething that could be reality m, or it could be fantasy , depending on he fold lol"
3818,174,agent_2,"oh ahah when you put it like that it';s a lot more scary . i think i'd prefer to live permanently where fantasy congrdss exists , i'd draft congress members completsly differently ."
3819,174,agent_1,"yeah that's another weird thing , people do fantasy congress , have you evet read anything by terry pratchett though ? i heard that he has a lot of good books , he was even knighted because he was such a good author"
3820,175,agent_1,the nfl has no written ru.e zgainst female players ; women would in fact be allowed if theym et the league's eligibility requireemns . i had no idea ! i would have thought they did but i guess not .
3821,175,agent_2,5hat i interesting but i wonder hwat the league's eligibilityr equirements are . what if they gad to have played foobtall in college ?
3822,175,agent_1,"i am not sure . based on the articl e, they could play . i think that they aren o tsexist , just biased against age ."
3823,175,agent_2,it is interersting that i watch an nfl game that takes usually over three hours and htere is only 11 minutes of actual action on wverage .
3824,175,agent_1,that is strange . the average lifetime earnings of an engineer is higher than the average lifetime earnings of an nfl player and an average mlb player .
3825,175,agent_2,well the averge player dos not last long in the league . i look forwwrd to the next wild card game today .
3826,175,agent_1,me too . what game are you interested in ? who are you rooting for ?
3827,175,agent_2,hopefully the bears wun because i do not like the eagles . they are both nfc teams .
3828,175,agent_1,"im from chicago and a huge bears fan so i have a rooting interext . did you know nw orleans saints cheerleaders are forbidden rrom eating in the sam erestaurant as any nfl payer wnd if they are already dining at a restaurnat and an nfl player coms in after , the cheerleaders are required to leave ."
3829,175,agent_2,to me gthat makes sense . some other companies are like that as well . who would you like to see in the super bowl ?
3830,175,agent_1,the bears vs the pats and hope for a rep3at of 1985 !
3831,175,agent_2,"hah ai am a cowboys fvan , so hte cowhoys against anytbody ."
3832,175,agent_1,good game yesterday . i thought yu 3ould have lost but pulled it out . it was a good gma3 . very entertaining . allen hurns thougj . . .
3833,175,agent_2,yeah that ws awful . things have certainly changed rom tue 1960 when professional bowlers made more than stars in football !
3834,175,agent_1,"agreed . nfl uses tracking chips embedded in players shoulder pads to record a players every move on the field . they are also located inside footballs to track : velocity , rotation , ball spesd and location ."
3835,175,agent_2,they shoyld to also check ho wtheir equipment is working . as athl4tes get bigger and faster they will need to wdjust the equipment .
3836,175,agent_1,"yash , especiall the helmet and concussions ."
3837,175,agent_2,i wonder how many t6eams have ripped off iowa paintingt ehir visting locker room pink . seems like excellent psychological warfare l.
3838,175,agent_1,"agreed . the highest score egver in a footbwall game occurred in 1916 when georgia tec defeated cumberalnd 2220 . you gotta switch your qb , right ?"
3839,175,agent_2,"haha , theh probably did not throw , or rhey could huave used benjarvus greenlelis who never fumbled once his entire nfl carser , lol ."
3840,175,agent_1,such a good fantasy player . peple fajytasy dfaft the national spelljng bee
3841,175,agent_2,"good grief , people will bet on anything tgere is even a fanasy congress league . crazy ."
3842,176,agent_1,good afternoon . ar you a football fan ?
3843,176,agent_2,"i am yes , what about you ?"
3844,176,agent_1,i am not really a fahn . although i hav an opinion oh the amount of money they get paid and i think4 5 million is way too much .
3845,176,agent_2,"i agree , 45 million is a lot ocf mopney , there is a coach that ie a rocket scientist ."
3846,176,agent_1,h eprkbably makes more money as a coach . i'ts hard to believe that each game is actually only eleven minutes of live play .
3847,176,agent_2,"i know right , only 11 minutes , last superbowl was moe than 3 hours long , maybe 4 all of that for only 11 minutes"
3848,176,agent_1,all those advertisements make a lot ot money for the nfl and the tickets are outrageous . i wonder if a woman will ever try to be eligible to play ?
3849,176,agent_2,"theres no written rule against woman pl,aying so yeah i think they could , its a physical sport though ,"
3850,176,agent_1,"i don't think women have the stamina ,b ut you never know . for that kidn of moeny someoje should try ."
3851,176,agent_2,"that wo7ld be interesting to watch , i agree , the first playovf gaem was play3d in 1932 seems like a long time since then"
3852,176,agent_1,"i wans't even born . i bt the tickets were cheap , though . there is a locker room painted pink at u of iowa . i wonder why ? maybe they thought they were gettin ga female player ."
3853,176,agent_2,"me neither and yeah not like today m, stadiums are really expensive to build , anr o guess they painted them pink to intimidate the other team"
3854,176,agent_1,that sounds like a good reason . i bet the othefr team were really mad . i wonder qhose fantasy taht wasa pink locke rroom .
3855,176,agent_2,"maybe the idea of the coach , wonder if it works , do you follo wcollege football ?"
3856,176,agent_1,"no , i get confused witha .l of the different teams . lol i did go to see a few boston university games a long time ago and they were fun ."
3857,176,agent_2,"it can be cofnusing , interesting fact but 14 of 25 of the largests stadiums are actully college football stadiums"
3858,176,agent_1,"that's a lot of stadiums . i don't think baseball has tha tman7y large stadiums . i actually like baseball better . it's not so brutal . bt they take a long time to play a game too . i doh't think they get pad as much , though ."
3859,176,agent_2,"htat is a lot i agree , and mostly football , i think its a more popular game , there is also a high schools tadium that cos6 60 millions tob e mzde"
3860,176,agent_1,that's a little ridiculous . it must be in a big city . i think people zhould nderstand that it is only netertainment . i see some grown men tzlking about a player on a team and they are actinbg like teenagers at a concert .
3861,176,agent_2,"it must be a big city i agree , seems like a lot of money for a high scho0l stadium , the flags are also reallyh eavy and edxpensive"
3862,176,agent_1,flags are always expensive . mos to fthem are made out of silj . i suppose tye uniforms cost a fortune too . my son's hihh school uniform was outrageous . i don't know how they expect parents to pay fdor them .
3863,176,agent_2,"i know right , they are expensive , well flags are about 50 ,0 00 eahc !"
3864,177,agent_1,"ehllo there , how are you doing today ? are you a big fantasy footbal fan ?"
3865,177,agent_2,i havs played fantasy football . do you have somje tips ?
3866,177,agent_1,"i plag too , but ufnortunately no , i just started a year ago but i did a lot better this season thanb lzst yea r."
3867,177,agent_2,"me to . i wnet with julio jones , who failed to produce points in line with his dragft position in2 017"
3868,177,agent_1,yeah he dind't do as well as prijected . i had some success withs ome of the kansas city players since htey had such a good season .
3869,177,agent_2,"marcus mariota , the qb of the titans slumped to just 13 td passes in 2017 , but did better for me in 2018 ."
3870,177,agent_1,"yeah i had him as a backup quarterback thiws eason on my tea m. speaking of fantasy , did you know there is a fantasy draf for the nwtional spelling bee ?"
3871,177,agent_2,that is pretty nuts . tghere is also a fantasy congress draft !
3872,177,agent_1,"what ! ? that is justa s crazy if not crazier . back to football , did you know the sverage game only has 11 minutes of actual gameplay ?"
3873,177,agent_2,ih ad heard that . do yout hink the national football league needs to expand beyond3 2 teams ?
3874,177,agent_1,"no i didn't know that eitehr . i hope there is a female player sometime soon , i guess that could technically happen ."
3875,177,agent_2,"yes , tej nfl has now ritten rule against female players"
3876,177,agent_1,"yeah , but you neve5 know , there could be something else a girl might be able to do ? that is interesting to think about though ."
3877,177,agent_2,"perhaps , but maybe women know better , since an engineer earns more lifetime htan a professional athelete !"
3878,177,agent_1,"wow ! but i guess when you think about it , they put in more years wgiel an nfl career isn't bery long ."
3879,177,agent_2,"true , and engineersa nd new orleans saints cheerledaders can ea tin the same restaurant , somethign players cannot do ."
3880,177,agent_1,tht is a strnage but true nfl facts . i guess bowlers in the 60's made more money than the top nfl players as well .
3881,177,agent_2,things sure have hcangewd . the chips embedded in shoulder pads these days are probably worth more than those player salaries !
3882,177,agent_1,yeah i bet those are worth a pretty penmny . crazy how tbe times have changed not only for football but all sports and money .
3883,177,agent_2,broadcasting too . espn won an emmy for the creation of the superimposed yellow line representing the firstd own linr .
3884,177,agent_1,"yeah i heard 5hat , it does help a ton for the fans watching at home . well it was nice talkung wiht you today , i hope you a have a good day ."
3885,178,agent_1,hi ! have you ever played fantasy football ?
3886,178,agent_2,9 have ! it can be addictin . lol
3887,178,agent_1,"my brothr got seriously into it , i mysel fhavent playdr much ."
3888,178,agent_2,it is fun . it makes watching football take on a whole different level .
3889,178,agent_1,there is fantaswy for just about everything k including congress nad the spelling bee
3890,178,agent_2,wow . i didn't know that . i wonder howt he spelling bee works ? lolh ow does the fantasy congress work ?
3891,178,agent_1,with fantasy congress they get points based on bills passed .
3892,178,agent_2,i would tink people would have t0 be uper bored to play fantqsy congress and the spelling bee . lol do you like football then ?
3893,178,agent_1,"pobably , it is probably hte members of congress who dont do thdir jobs being bored in it ."
3894,178,agent_2,lol ou nailed that on the head ! did you know that the university of iowa painted hteir visitors locker room completely pink ? must have did that to play mental games with the visitors .l ol
3895,178,agent_1,sounds like it ; nothing like a sokcing color on the walls to throw iff your game .
3896,178,agent_2,lol right ? in tne 1906's top bolwers made twice as much asz the top football star sof the day . tiems have sure cahnged since then .
3897,178,agent_1,"trhey sure have , it would likely take half of the top bowlers to equal one football sta r."
3898,178,agent_2,lol yes . do you know waht the high4st scoring footbal lgame ofa ll time is ?
3899,178,agent_1,"yeah , its almost unbelievabel . 2220"
3900,178,agent_2,holy smkes ! someone racked up a lot o fantasy points that day . lol
3901,178,agent_1,"unless you had a player on cumberland's team , then that lbew your whole season . lol"

3903,178,agent_1,"untortunately , the dolphins . . . im never oing to see them in a suler bowl . . ."

4101,187,agent_1,i actually use my phone f9r music since that its more consistent . i am interes6ed in how radios world and how it is being used in dewp space exploration rather than daily use
4102,187,agent_2,"now , i can give you an answer . i use my phone most of the time . i have blietooth l isn't there rqdios in jupiter ?"
4103,187,agent_1,well jupiter have radio srormxss o strongw e can detect them here on earth with radios
4104,187,agent_2,is it in the am o ffmk radio ?
4105,187,agent_1,"that i am not sure , but i am sure th eradios are more sophisticated than the foxholr radio sof wwii ."
4106,187,agent_2,"maybe , they are now called walkie talkies ."
4107,187,agent_1,can ealkie talkies intercept noise ? i thought it usually was connected to pairs
4108,187,agent_2,"wlk , walkie talkies should . how are yu going to contac teach other ? mayb ethes oldiers were grouped in pqairs . it is all conspiracy ."
4109,187,agent_1,lol i don't know about radios . all i know are that the foxhole radios in wwii were made of a razorblade nd pencil . i have no clue how i tworks
4110,187,agent_2,i do not know aboutf radios either . that is an interesting way to make radios .
4111,187,agent_1,"ya something we know hlw to use them yet sometimes we have no clue ho they work . in an7 case , i enjoyed our chat"
4112,187,agent_2,ie njoyed cahtting with ou as well ;

4114,188,agent_1,do you like sports ? i watch football every now and then but i don't really cqre for baskegball .
4115,188,agent_2,"yeah , i dnt watch basketball at all . i used to watch football before all of th ekneeling and protesting . now my sundays awre ,ine again ."
4116,188,agent_1,"so do you agree or disagree with the kneelong ? the anthem and pledge are not a requiremnrt by law , pluse it had nothing to do with the united states itself anx was more in protest to polic eviolece ."
4117,188,agent_2,i don't agree with the protestin g. players should protest or be active on their own time .
4118,188,agent_1,"i can agreew ith that . i think he iust wanted the most publicity he could , and i hateh ow it isd so over bloewn ."
4119,188,agent_2,the nfl has given in to tyhe pc culture and thought police in the us .
4120,188,agent_1,"i feel like everything is going that way trhese days , everyone i sso offended by every little thing now . also i thin we should ll protest the nfl after that last superb9wl , it was so awful , lowest scorin gsuperbowl in history ;."
4121,188,agent_2,i 3as a huge fan . k didnt even watch the superbow lthis year . anohter patriots win . . . . yawn . . . . i man yay
4122,188,agent_1,"yeha that is probably for hte best , there was only one score , it was extremely borin , sop whaty is your favorite tv show to watch right now ."
4123,188,agent_2,"i don't watch a lot of tv eihter , we can run through some of this tv trivia though . there are over 750 episodes of pokemon . that's about 50 a year for 16 years ."
4124,188,agent_1,"yeah my nephews watch pokemon on netflix , i cound itt oo silly though . i did not know the uk did their own version of thats 70s sbow that was caceled after 10 episodes though ."
4125,188,agent_2,"yeah , that show was ok , kinda funn7 from what i remember . hard to believe only 1 episode f the simpsosn without bart , metnioned or appearing ."
4126,188,agent_1,"yeah i still watch it on netflix every now and then if i am bored , i have been re watching game of thrones as of late though ."
4127,188,agent_2,"ahh yeah , i did binbe through 6the gam of thrones series . do you know whne the series wil,l be released ?"
4128,188,agent_1,"yep , o love it , the next season starts april 14th . i really wish it wasn'?t the last season but grrm just takes too long to finish the books ."
4129,188,agent_2,perfect !l ookingf o5ward to i treturning .
4130,188,agent_1,"yeah it will b einteresting to see how john and daenerys deal with who getst he throne , since kohn is the actual heir ."
4131,188,agent_2,"yeah , should be good . will b interesting to see ."
4132,188,agent_1,"yep , will it was nice talking to you ,h ave a good day ."
4133,188,agent_2,you too !
4134,188,agent_1,good onversation always makes these hits better .
4135,189,agent_1,do you enjoy the nfl .
4136,189,agent_2,"no i a mnot as ports fan but there ae some interesting things i learned about recently . like , did you know that the averag enfl live gamepay is onl7 11 minutes per game ?"
4137,189,agent_1,"i'm not surprised . there are an extreme amount of commercials , reviews , and penalties . i did not know that there are no written rules against female players in the nfl . but they have to meet the eligibility requirements and as large as those men are i doubtt hat happens ."
4138,189,agent_2,"i did not know that there were no ruled against women , but like you said it would be unlikely that any woman could meet the requirements . the players have tracking hips in their shoulder pads and the ball as well; . i guess that has helped wih various informations ."
4139,189,agent_1,i hage to wonder why they would need to grack them so closely . there are cameras everywhere anx they use the cameras and the refs tom ake calls so why th eneed to track them so precisely ?
4140,189,agent_2,i would have no idea . i wonder wjhy air jordans wer banned when they were firsg untroduced .
4141,189,agent_1,i do not know . my guess is that they considered it product placement and didn't want to allow him the advertisement during games . jordan wore them anywau though and nike paid his fines .
4142,189,agent_2,"your are probably correct . wow , i guess the fine was nothing for htem to cover . do you know who allen iverson is or that he gad a contract with reebockt hat would pay him 800 , 000 a yer until he was 55 ?"
4143,189,agent_1,i don't but thats' a huge contract . he's set for life . i did know that rehgiem iller has a sister who was better than him at basketball in high school . she scored more points them him adn brok eight ntionalr evords .
4144,189,agent_2,"their ability must nbe at least partilaly genetic . i did not know the nba includes 1 team that is from canad a, that is interestugn ."
4145,189,agent_1,i didn't eihter . i also did not know that basketball playere are the highest paid athltes based on avrage annual salary per player . i would have though tthat footabll players made more .
4146,189,agent_2,i would have thoughtt he same as you . i wonder what th egranny styel technique is . physicists say it is the best tehnique for scoring points but that no one does it because it looks stupid .
4147,189,agent_1,that's when you squat and throw the all from between your legw underhanded with both hands . i would thinmk it woudl be harder to aim that way not easier .
4148,189,agent_2,"oh , thank you . i can not imagine how that would be a go0od way to swcore point s. i did ot know that paul allen ownedt eams . i wonder what became of them after he died ?"
4149,189,agent_1,no probl3m . tha tquestion i do not know the answer to . a player named tim duncan delayed his entrance in the nba to complete collebe . i'm glad he saw that education was important but that wax risky because tney na not want you four years later when you finish .
4150,189,agent_2,yes it was risky but it is ni8ce to lewarn that some 9f th eplayers actulaly do prioritize their education . i guess it is rare . did you knowt ha the new orleans saitns cheerleaderz can not eat in th esame restzaurant ss the players and even if they are theref irst they have to leave if a player somes in ?
4151,189,agent_1,that's horrible . i don't think they treqt their heerlewders well and i don't like that aspect . i recen6ly disckvere dthat most make around minimum wage .
4152,189,agent_2,"that is terrible and we know that they can all easily afford to pay them a lot more . so the rgular season ends in late dec . so i guess the big game is coming up soon . wil, you watch ?"
4153,189,agent_1,i'mk sure i will but i'm not excited about it . i'm so sick of seeing the patriots . it's boring go see them at thia point . i' erather see o9ther teans . six teams from each conference mjae th eplayoffs and we emd up with the patriots again or
4154,189,agent_2,oh yes ih eard that . i also heard about some call in a gam ethat a ref made . some people wereq uite upset about it . i agree a different team makes irt more fun .
4155,189,agent_1,there were terrible calls in both gamws but i would imagine you are talking aboutt hen no6 calling pass interferenc eduring the saints game . it was a very bad call ir lack f i suppose .
4156,190,agent_1,i knew of paul allen and his relationship with bill gates in teh founding of microsoft . but i did not know he was a owne rwit hthe seattle seahawksa nd plrtland trail blazer franvhises . did you ?
4157,190,agent_2,i actually did mnot kno wthat ! i was very sad to learn of his passing . ia ctually did not know he was battling nonhodgkin's lymphoma . it was also sad knowing paul didn't have a wife or kids either .
4158,190,agent_1,"he did not and the nearest heir ks his siste5r . from what i have been reading , sge is not into sportsl ike paul was . so she might want to sell rather than try to ryn the fracnhises ."
4159,190,agent_2,that's probably her best shot anyway . betfer to sell it to someone who loves sports . so re you a fan of the nba ? i am and hope to one day visit the the head offices in new york ! i bet it is a fascinatin gto see !
4160,190,agent_1,"i followed the bulls whne i lived in chicag for about 10 7earw wnd michael ordin was king . since moving back to louisiana , i have not really fololowed irt that much . spkaing of mj , did you know tha tthe nba banned him from wearing nik air jordan sgoes . . eh did anyway and nike covered the fines l that was a good pr move for nik e."
4161,190,agent_2,"avreed . a very wise decidion in my o;inion ! they make so much money olff sponsorships , its insane ! lie aklen iverson , he signed a ljfetim edeal with reebok that pays him 800k per year until he hits 55 . then they'll pay him a lump sum of 32 milli0n . that is just downright unbelievable !"
4162,190,agent_1,"endorsements and sponsorship deals are extremely lucrative . it seems teh stars make more monewy that way than playing the game . switching to the nfl , d0 you know of any tom brady endorsements ? he has to have some major ones in the works with another superbow2l win ."
4163,190,agent_2,no kidding ! i can only imaginhe !u a ! but can uyou believe taht nfl and mlb players make less in a lifetime than engibeers do ?
4164,190,agent_1,"3e always hear about th3 sta5's salaries , but not thr rest of the 21st and 2nd atring . so i could see tuhat an engineer with a 40 year career could easily out earn an avwerage nfl player with a 10 year career . a guess that given the few slots available 6o miove up fromc ollgiate to pro , you enter the dratt when the time is righ 5tregardless if you are nearing finishin gyour degree ."
4165,190,agent_2,"thwt is true . but you know what gets me ? th4re are no rules that against females playong as long as they meet the r3quirements . so i can't believe on has never bewn signed as at least a kicker , especially in this day and age !"
4166,190,agent_1,"the glass ceiling for refs vcaem crashing down during the playoffs with the 1stn fl ref oficiatung a playoff game . so , it is probably just a matter of time . what i find interesting is how tech has changed the game . now w have tracking chips in shoulder pads and balls to know precise location and other parameters ."
4167,190,agent_2,"agreed . it's amazign how technologically advsnceds the game has become , despite the actual live gameplay iself only lasting an average of 11 minutes !"
4168,190,agent_1,"i am stil, trying to figure hat one out . we have four f15 minute quarters , or 60 minutes . so where does the time go ? i wonder with the advent of v , game play time is affected b the need for commercial breaks ?"
4169,190,agent_2,"i would imagine so . it just doesn't seem real though , doe sit ? speaking of unreal nfl facts , can you believe saints cheerleaders aren't allowed to eat in the same restaurant as the saints players ? in fact , if a player enters a restaurant they're dining in , the cheerleaders have to leave . i'm surpriused no discrimination lawsuits have been filed over that !"
4170,190,agent_1,"some traditions or suprerstitions revolving around sporte is unreal ! for example , its a proven fact that ' granny style ' is the most consistent shootin style for free throws . bna players refuse to do it because ' it looks stupids ' ."
4171,190,agent_2,"ha ! i don't blqme them there , even though i wouldn't be surprise dto see a player evemntuqlly try that approach . but when you're the best paid atheltes by average annual salary uin the world , looking silly is the last thing one would want !"
4172,190,agent_1,i gues s. . . do you watch much sports on tv or aminly other shows ?
4173,190,agent_2,i do and i actuall6 love the simpson's . there's one episod in particualr where bart never make an appearance nor is even mentioned that i still want to see . what about you ?
4174,190,agent_1,"i do not watch much sports on tv . its just not the same as being thwre . so , i have season t8cket sto my alma mater , the lsu tigers . the simpson's have been going strong since 1989 thats unbelievable . did y9u know that wheh family guy ended , the crew received flowers from the simpsons production tea m? i wonder if it was congratula6ions , condolences , or a bit of both ?"
4175,190,agent_2,hq ! it hink it was more of a thank you . i can only guess neither of them like family guy . were you a fan of teh 70s show ? i wa slooking forward to seeing the uk remake b7t it was sady cancelled after 1o episodes .
4176,190,agent_1,"the 70x show was not really my ztyel . i am more into drama . and , the kids when younger were into thomas the tank engine and similar shows . did you know ringo starr , geor4ge farlin , qnd alc balwin all did more than 52 episodes of thomas ? i found that astonishing considerign carlin and baldwi nare both know for very salty languaqge !"
4177,190,agent_2,"oh , no ! i wasn't aware of that . hard to believe all three of them served as narrators ! i was into pokemon m0re whe i was younger although i don't thin, i watched evne half of the 750 episodes of pokemon . ha 2 that is far too manu . well it was a pleasure chatting wiht you ! i hope ykj have a great evening , my frien d!"

4185,191,agent_2,"oh nice ! i would love to have my own bar ! speaking of ba4 , it reminds me of bart szimpson , haha did you know in the entire show of ' the simpsons ' , there is only one episod where isd oesnt come out or is mentioned ! did you ever eatch that show ? i'm just full of fun fafts today : ,"

4203,192,agent_2,"yeah , i heard that . i guess it's hard for teams to adjust around a lefty ."
4204,192,agent_1,"i wonder if that s in fact the issue , seems like a lot of work to work around that ."
4205,192,agent_2,"i see so many lefties in the mlb , i figure it would be the same in the nfl . i am surprised by the origins o fthe huxdlde ."
4206,192,agent_1,"yeah , it was to hide singalsf om the opposing t5eam !"
4207,192,agent_2,cleve r. uit's such a fundamental part of the game now . do you listen to the radio much ?

4216,192,agent_1,lol .d id you know that thw president of indonesi ahas released 3 pop albums while i noffice ?
4217,192,agent_2,i guess he had a following . i bet tr8mpw oulds releas ealbums .
4218,192,agent_1,"maybe , i'm not sure . were the ones in indonesia euccezssful ?"
4219,192,agent_2,i hav no ideaw . he probably made a law that people had to buy tuem . trumpw ould probably record with kanye .
4220,192,agent_1,that would be a good album wouldn't it ?
4221,193,agent_1,dp you play or watch football ?
4222,193,agent_2,i love the nfl !
4223,193,agent_1,did you see alex smith's injury ? hed rboke his tibia and fibula .
4224,193,agent_2,that was a nasty injury ; they only showed it once on replay though
4225,193,agent_1,"that is good , it is a gruesome injury to look at . i watched live as a cowboy's ankle broke last weekend , terrible ."
4226,193,agent_2,"oh yeah , that was a nasty one too . there have been way too man7 injuries this year"
4227,193,agent_1,i agree wiht that ! football cazn g3t dagnerous sometimes . some things you don't 2ant5 to watch with a weak stomach .
4228,193,agent_2,who is your favorite qb ?
4229,193,agent_1,"right now i like das prscott , who is yours ? they have a big responsibility in calling the play while in huddle ."
4230,193,agent_2,i have really taken a liking to mahomes but have been a fan of brady and brees for many years
4231,193,agent_1,"awesome , not a huge huge fan of football , ut rooting for the cowboys this year , though it"
4232,193,agent_2,they will ave a tough game against the rams this weekesnd ; the rams have a good qb too .
4233,193,agent_1,"it will be a tough one to try ands win for the cowboys , since it has been so long taht they have gone to the supebrowl . i find it cool that alex smit hreceived hisb achelor's degre ein two years !"
4234,193,agent_2,he will need it especially if h ecan't com eback to football after his injury
4235,193,agent_1,tha tis d3finitely true with that injury he sustained . did you know they created the huddle because of a deaf qb named paul hubbard ?
4236,193,agent_2,i did but i don't understand 3hy the nfl and qbs still do it
4237,193,agent_1,"not sure , i guess it makes their plays less likely to be heard or seen ."
4238,193,agent_2,i once beat baker mayfiedl in halo 3 in an online tournament ; he's not really that good
4239,193,agent_1,"awesome ! i gueses he better stick to football only then ? i thoughtm kre people were left handed , bu tkellan moore is the only left hndlecd qb in tge nfl !"
4240,193,agent_2,mahomes has been throwing some passrs ;eft handed lately
4241,193,agent_1,"taht's cool , is he normally left hande d? or dxo you think he has an ijuryt o his righ thand ?"
4242,193,agent_2,"no , he got stuck in a picole and adjusted for the play"

4373,199,agent_1,i had no idea ! new york's area code is 212 because it was the fastest number to dial on a rotary phone ! i had a good tiem chatting with you !

4383,200,agent_2,wow ! tbhat must mean a lot of commercials and penatlies ho on during a gake ! football has beden around a long time though . the first playoff was in 1932 .
4384,200,agent_1,"wo w, that is a long time ! but football is loved by many ! 8 didn't know thqat football p.layers don't really make as much money as you would tbink , an engineer makes more in a lifetime than an nlf player !"
4385,200,agent_2,i guess that means that matt patricia likes the game then more than money considering he wzas an aeronauticap engineer before becoming a coach .

4478,204,agent_1,so the champions league determines the overall champion ?

4480,204,agent_1,"that's a lot , and i know there's a lot ofd eal action , whereas footba;l only has 11 minutes of live action in a game ."

4488,205,agent_2,that is pretty crazy considering that he football players are more prone to injuries l9l i guess it was good to be3 a bowler back then q
4489,205,agent_1,"i agre eand theres also all that brain damage , i think its a risk sport but now yoi will earn a lot of money fo rdoing so ."
4490,205,agent_2,yeah foo6ball players do mae a ridiculous amount of money !

4501,205,agent_1,"yeah in soccer injuries are quite common , there are over 250m illion players so imagine how many broken legs that figure represents ."
4502,205,agent_2,"yieks , id rather not thanks lol i hear soccet players run an average of 7 miels per game !"
4503,205,agent_1,"that is a long distanc e3, 7 miles per game , it must be really exhausting ."
4504,205,agent_2,i recently learned that greenlnd cnt joim fifa because there's not enough grass there lol can't they usd fake grass ?
4505,205,agent_1,"i agree lol , wiht all the tech they could dsefietly install a soccer court with fake grass ,. so,e pro fteams have them ,"
4506,206,agent_1,do you watch football ?
4507,206,agent_2,yes i did snoop dogg wrote a song for his son's football team oce
4508,206,agent_1,wow nice . bowlera used to make more htan football playuers in the 60s
4509,206,agent_2,i guess it was a more popular sport back in the day
4510,206,agent_1,mnake sense right ? eo you know what the highest score in college football is ?
4511,206,agent_2,"hmk i am not so sute , it is a big difference ?"
4512,206,agent_1,"it sure is , 2220 georgia tech v4rsus cumberland"

4515,206,agent_2,i did not . what did tehy win it for ?
4516,206,agent_1,fof tyes uperimposed yellow line . did you know women can play in the nfl ?
4517,206,agent_2,did not know that . they ar3e using chips to track the players in the field
4518,206,agent_1,"nie . what are they tradking , anything specific ?"
4519,206,agent_2,yes they track for velocity and rotation and balls speed and a bunch of stuff
4520,206,agent_1,nice i wonder if that can be used in ant way to make the game safer
4521,206,agent_2,good point . did you know a coach used to be a rocket scientist ?
4522,206,agent_1,really that is a huge jump inc a5reer who is that ?
4523,206,agent_2,that us matt patricia and you ar dright about the career jmp for sure
4524,206,agent_1,yea . do you like association football ?
4525,206,agent_2,i do like it . do you know players run 7 miles per game ?
4526,206,agent_1,"that is a lo tof miles , wow"
4527,207,agent_1,are you a ntl fan ?
4528,207,agent_2,i am . i ike the steelers
4529,207,agent_1,who are you going for in super bowl ?
4530,207,agent_2,any team 9ther thzn new england . i do prefer thwe eagles though .
4531,207,agent_1,"though i'm glad the playoffs are here , i?m sad the zeason is coming to an end ."
4532,207,agent_2,it will make sundays a little more boring without football to watch .
4533,207,agent_1,"i hope to see a woman player in the nfl soon , maybe as a kicker at least ."
4534,207,agent_2,that would be interesting .
4535,207,agent_1,i just hate the fact the actual live gaemplay is so short .
4536,207,agent_2,i8d o too . it i sactually ridiculous that if is only 11 minutes . there are too many commercials .
4537,207,agent_1,"with as many commercials , you would think the players would ne paid better than engineers ."
4538,207,agent_2,"most peopel think hat they are paid these huge salaries , so thety won't have to worry about their futures , but most cannot play for too lon g, so ys an engineer can amke more money ."
4539,207,agent_1,naybe the sndorsements help to make up the gap for some o fthe more recognizable players .
4540,207,agent_2,most likely . they probably make more ove rtheir lifetimes in ensorsements thna jus tfrom salary alone .
4541,207,agent_1,did you know the saints cheerleaders have to leave thge restauranf if players come in
4542,207,agent_2,i just learned that . i don't get that . that is the dumbest thing in the world . i have no idea what the reason for that is . maybe th football players shouldn't be permitted to eat at the restaurant if the cheereladers were there first .
4543,207,agent_1,makes the league and team look hypocritical of women
4544,207,agent_2,"absolutely . tlak about degrading as well . but they also se tracking chips im shoulder pads to record every player move on a field , so ther league has some issues ."
4545,207,agent_1,i wonder what kind orf stats are collected and they are used
4546,207,agent_2,i coul;dn't imagine . they can just rewatch games to see what had happened . they don't need chips . very creepy .
4547,207,agent_1,go patriots !
4548,208,agent_1,"hi , how are you htis morning ?"
4549,208,agent_2,"great ! hope you're dojng well ! zo do you follow associaftion football aka soccer ? hard to believe it makes more money than golf , tennis , football , basketbal l, baseball and hockey combined !"
4550,208,agent_1,i watch a littl esoccer . i didn't realize it made so much money .
4551,208,agent_2,"i'ts crazy , isn't it ? i guess thst's why mesut ozil donated his entirew old cup victory bonus to pay for the surgery of 23 children in brazil . must have been pocket change considerign !"
4552,208,agent_1,"i guess if you take into consideration it's played by 250 million people worldwids ein over 200 countries , it is alot of money . that was suc a great act that mest did for those kids . kudos to him ."
4553,208,agent_2,agreed ! hopefully others follow in his footsteps . so so youf ollow regular football aka gridiron ball like the nfl ? i do and always wondered why there are no fmeales when the nfl has no rule sagainst them joining as long as they meet the requirements !
4554,208,agent_1,"i watch a little footbal. . i'vwe wondered myself about tne females , as well ."
4555,208,agent_2,"i mean , there's only 11 minutes of live game play anyway . so you'd think at leas ton or two would have been drafted 9r picked up by a team , right ?"
4556,208,agent_1,"true , that's alot of standinga round time ont he sidelines , for sure . you would think at least a kicker would be a fenale ."
4557,208,agent_2,"agreed . maybre they'd rather enter engineering since engineers make more than the average lifetime earnings of an nfl or mlb player . it'd be a much wiser decksion , i suppose !"
4558,208,agent_1,that's so true . i find it interesting that the topb owlers in the 1960s made twice as much as the top football stsrs . that' swild .
4559,208,agent_2,"no kidding ! what' seven wilder , or sadder actually , is knowing saints cheerleaders are not allowed to eat in the same restaurant as saints player sand ifg one walks in afte r, they hwve to leave . that is jst wrong !"
4560,208,agent_1,i know . i'd like to know the incident that prompted that rule . i bet it's very hjuicy .
4561,208,agent_2,"exaclty . i wonde rwhat happene d! stjll that could classify as discrimination in this day and ate , i suppose . but is that truly as bad as georgia tech oncxe beating a team 2220 ? h ! tbhe highesst score ever in the game of football !"
4562,208,agent_1,"7eah , i think that gams was played way back in 9116 , nowadays that just desn't ahppen , anymore . look at the recent supebrowl , lowest scoring superbowl game ever ."
4563,208,agent_2,"so tue !b ut when you have player sin the league liek benjarvus greenellis never fumblign the ball , i can see why !"
4564,208,agent_1,that's a retty awesome feat for hum to accomplish . imagine the pressu5e of never fumbling the ball . it would b4 too much for me .
4565,208,agent_2,"same here . i'd probably fumble as soon as it's handed to me . ha ! wonder what his mindset would be if he was forced to visit the visitor's lockerroom at iowa before a game , where the massage pink ? talk about demeaning ! that's crazy !"
4566,208,agent_1,"an all pink locker room would b every intimidating for any visiting team , for sure , getting back to slccer , i was shocked to learn that jon stewart was a skilled soccer player ."
4567,208,agent_2,"wow ! that is shocking ! i tell you what surprised me was learning there is actually a soccer variation where 3 teams face each other at the exact same time ! it's like , how does that happeb ?"
4568,208,agent_1,"that's pretty wild , i'd likw to watch a game of that being played . well , it's ben nice chatting with yout his morning . i njeed to get to work , i'll talk to you later , friend ."
4569,209,agent_1,hi . do you like sports ?
4570,209,agent_2,"hi , i d0 like football as in nfl football , although i am a faqn of associatio nfootball as well ."
4571,209,agent_1,me too . i like the nfl but i do also watch other leagues of football as well on occasion . did you hear thst winston churchill high is doign very well ?
4572,209,agent_2,"is thwt high school football ? can't say i have watched that , at least not since i was in high school . sometimes i watch canadian football which is a little different hten nfl ."
4573,209,agent_1,6hat is high school football and winxton churchill high hire da former nfl corner back to lead the football team there .
4574,209,agent_2,oh right . now that you mention it i think i did see something about this on espn . wil;ie williams is running the team right ?
4575,209,agent_1,htat is correct . they also hbired chri ssamuels and je played offensive tackle for the redskins .
4576,209,agent_2,it's interesting thede guysw ant to coach high school foobtall after being pros . you'd think they w2ould havem ade more then enough money in the nfl to sett hemn for life .
4577,209,agent_1,i thin kthat they did it o give back to teh community because th4y did make theirm oney in the nfl and this is a way for the them to give back .
4578,209,agent_2,"that's probably right . then again maybe playing in hte nfl doesn't set you for life . association ftootball players ,s occer , make more money ."
4579,209,agent_1,way back in the 60s the best football players made less than the top bowlers at that timw .
4580,209,agent_2,that's crazy . i wonder if back then there was mord action in nfl games ? don't get me wrong i enjoy it but ghe average game has just 11 minutes of actual game play .
4581,209,agent_1,that was insane indeed . i didn't know that but going back to your previlus pint soccer players make more mony than any othe rsport out rherte .
4582,209,agent_2,since they make more money thsey cn be mord generous mesuit ozil donated his 300 000 euro world cup bonus to pay for children's surgeries . i've nevdr heard of ann fl player donating hiss uper bowl bonus .
4583,209,agent_1,neither do i . that was a veryg enerous donation by mesut ozil and he is a fantastic soccer player is he german ?
4584,209,agent_2,yes . the surgeries for for children in brazil . the host country of that world cup . such a nice story .
4585,209,agent_1,this is truly inspiring .
4586,209,agent_2,"it's funny that we even call association football soccer he5e . did you ,now ' soccer ' is a slang term ? that's how it originallt caught on ."
4587,209,agent_1,i didn't know that socceer is slang term and its kind of weird that is called asdociation football here .
4588,209,agent_2,almost as weird as 3 team soccer have you see nthat before ? all 3 teams play at once !
4589,209,agent_1,that is crazy . i'm not sure what the actual rules for this type of game are .
4590,209,agent_2,i only saw it onc eand it was really ahrd to f9llow . anyways i've got to get going .
4591,209,agent_1,me too . thanks fcorc hatting with me today . have a nice dau .
4592,209,agent_2,bye
4593,209,agent_1,bye
4594,210,agent_1,hey are you going o watch th exfl ? and have you ever been to audi field
4595,210,agent_2,i do plan on wathing the xfl ! i think it will be interesting to see how the xfl and dc united shar 4ethe southwest dc facility in 2020 considering ho wfootball will take a harder toll on the grass there . what abou5 you .
4596,210,agent_1,yeah i'm looking forward to the sfl actually . i also miss the days before football stadiums were named after corporate sponsor slol like audi field
4597,210,agent_2,"so true ! ha ! are you also a fan of the nf, ? to thisd ay , i'm surprised no female players have been signed considering there are n rules against women playing as long as they meet the eligibilityr equirementfs ."
4598,210,agent_1,"i think we'll see a female nfl player someday , i just wish they woul dfix the issue with opnly having 11 minutes of live gameplay per game , that seem sso borin gto me"
4599,210,agent_2,"so true . i mean , if they can create chips that tracks players movements and ball location or speed or veocity or otatiobn , they can extent the live ameplay time . it's ridiculous , isn't it ?"
4600,210,agent_1,"that is ridiculous , i'm not sure why theyw oul xwant to kno the rktation of the ball , bu ti can understan why theya ant to kno wa player's spee daned locatjon"
4601,210,agent_2,"you're right . but then again ,e ngineersm ake more than the average lifetime earnings of both mlb and nfl players so maybe it's easier engineers to create these chips than it is for nfl officials to adjust the gamepaly time ."
4602,210,agent_1,"yeah that is hsocking . because you think they would makje so much money . do you ever watch soccer by the way , also kniwna s association football"
4603,210,agent_2,"i do , actually . what bout you ? i s5il lcan't believe it makes mor emoney than the six other major sports combined !"
4604,210,agent_1,"tyeah i never watch it i think it's really boring , but it is shocking that it makes more than even amerocan football , have you ever seen the variation wehre three soccer team sare playing all at onc"
4605,210,agent_2,no but i bt it's wild to see . ha ! wonder if players are allowed to touch th ball with their hands and arms while it's in paly unlike regular soccer ?
4606,210,agent_1,"yea i don't know it sound smore interesting to me than regular soccer though lol , have you heard of fhe german player mesut ozil ?"
4607,210,agent_2,i admire him because he donated hjis entire world cup bonus to payf or the surgeries of 23 diffetrent kids over in brzzil . i wish all ath;etes were like him !
4608,210,agent_1,"yes thats ounds awsome , he donated over 300 , 000 euros to do that too and eh didn't even have to , what a nice guy"
4609,210,agent_2,"agreed . o na similar soccer note , did you know john stewart was a great soccer player in college . he alsor epresented the us in brazil at the pan american maccabi games back in 83 !"
4610,210,agent_1,"thaw's ve5y impressive ! i never knew tha the played , what do you think about refular football aka american football"
4611,210,agent_2,"i do enjoy football in general . in fact , benjarvus greenellis was one of my favorite players because he never cumbled the football in his entire pro caree r, which is amazing !"
4612,210,agent_1,i agree it is amazing ! yhey shou;d pay him a lot od money ! what do you think about uspn winning an emmy for creating the yellow line thats hows during tv broadcasts of foo5tballg ames
4613,210,agent_2,"they truly deserved it . the yellow line is so 9nnovative ad i don't think i can watch a game without it . we talked about engineers getting paid more earlier , but can you believe the top bowlers ,ade more than tfhe top footbal players back in the 60s ? that's so sad and disaopointing considering how rough football is compared to how easy bowling is ."
4614,210,agent_1,yes i think bowling is much easier than brcoming a professiona football player lol . what do you htink about umniversity of owa paintojng their locker rooms completely pi9nk
4615,211,agent_1,"hi , do you watch football"
4616,211,agent_2,"yez , i watch football sometimes but i'm more of a basketbal fan . how about you ?"
4617,211,agent_1,"i also watch basketball , and it is oje of my favorite sports ."
4618,211,agent_2,im actually watching the lakers vs warriorsr ight now
4619,211,agent_1,me too . hopefully nothing wrongw ith lebron
4620,211,agent_2,im not a lberon fa n! ! ! im hoping something is a little wrong witu him haha
4621,211,agent_1,"whafev4er ,. btw , do you watch football games this season"
4622,211,agent_2,"no havent watched any , dif you knos soccer makes more money than football , basketball , baseball , golf , tennis adn hokcey combined . ?"
4623,211,agent_1,i rhink it makes sense to me because soccer is the most popular sport i the world .
4624,211,agent_2,im not a soccer fan so im npt to sure what they make
4625,211,agent_1,i think soccer players make less money than a basketball player . but as a whol4e soccer isw atched by a lot of oeople more in comparieon to basketball . that is just my opinion
4626,211,agent_2,yea basketbaqll players are jaking upwards of 50m illion a year thats crazy . i know overseas soccer is a huge sport . in there exists a var8ation of soccer where 3 teams face each other at the same time .
4627,211,agent_1,i never bheard of such thing . how 3 teams can play on the field a tthe same time is a mind blowing . hahhaa
4628,211,agent_2,im dsure that would cause a lot of confusion on the tield !
4629,211,agent_1,bot hto the players adn the viewer s. did ypu know that jon stewar was a skilled soccer playet in ollege an din for he us in the pan american maccabi games ?
4630,211,agent_2,"i had no idea , im ah uge jon stewart fan ,s peaking f football in the 1960'st op bowlers made twice as much as top footba;k stars"
4631,211,agent_1,i am very surprisex that a top bowler made more than a top football player . what hap0pened to the sport of bowling ? bowling popularity has drastically dwcreased
4632,211,agent_2,"i love bowling , i play wll the time . tried tking my lirttle brother hes aid it was ' boring ' and that ' fortnite ' was more fun ."
4633,211,agent_1,"i agree with your brother there . but we have different hobbies and interests , right ?"
4634,211,agent_2,"agreed , as long as everyone tries different things with an open mindt hen thats all we can ask for"
4635,211,agent_1,"your warrior wilk go down today , hahaha . tbw , nice chattin gwith you . enjoy the game"
4636,211,agent_2,htank yo . we will come back stronger !
4637,212,agent_1,"i have a friend whop isc onsidering enginrering , and i should tell her that she'l make more in herl ifetime than the average nfl or mlb player"
4638,212,agent_2,"it is true , sometimes it rreally does pay to eb smart"
4639,212,agent_1,"of course , if she worked hard enough to meet the eligibility requirements , she could technically join the nfl"
4640,212,agent_2,"ive never heard of a female player in teh nfl , but plenty who play ' association football ' or soccer as most people say it ."
4641,212,agent_1,soccer was actually a slang term that americans uhse . but it's slang for the official ham
4642,212,agent_2,"it is a wildly popular sport . the suoper bowl , is smaller tuhan soccer's third biggest 3vent ."
4643,212,agent_1,taht's not surprising consider8ing over 200 countries play yhe sport
4644,212,agent_2,the only country that definitely cant join is greenland . not enough grass grows there for a soccer field .
4645,212,agent_1,"even without their ijvovlmeent , soccer still makes more nmoney than the other popular spodts combined"
4646,212,agent_2,"it does , and it has some major activists too .t here was an ivory coast player who single ahndedly stopped a civil war ."
4647,212,agent_1,that's ikpressive . a germa nplayer paid for surgeried for children in brazil using his world cup victory bonus
4648,212,agent_2,so many pwlyers have contributed so positively to society . that is one thing i really like about the socer community .
4649,212,agent_1,jon stewart was part of that community dring hisc ollege days and played at the pan american maccabi games
4650,212,agent_2,"i didnt know that . thats pretty cool ., snoop dog actually wrote his son's high achool fight song"
4651,212,agent_1,i wonder if they still use that every year . it still doesn't get used as much as the superimposed yellow first down line taht ezspn created for american football . they even have an emmy fr that inventiob
4652,212,agent_2,"i know , that is an important one . my mother was surprised it wasnt there when she watched my brother play live in high school ."
4653,212,agent_1,it definitely helps in keeping track of hte game . i wonder who ahd to keep track of the score thme georgia bea tcumberland in1 916 . 220 points is a lot !
4654,212,agent_2,"wow , uhow bad must one team be to not score , and get that many points scored on yhem . i wonder how many turnovers there were in that game ."
4655,212,agent_1,6oo any ! it's still the highest score to occur in a football game
4656,212,agent_2,14 of the 25 largest stadiums belong to cpllege football teams .
4657,212,agent_1,i wonder if players from those teams who get drafted to the nfl are used to the atmosphere of lrge stadiums
4658,213,agent_1,"hi , do yiou like soccer ?"
4659,213,agent_2,i think i know a bit more about american football . i know in tebh nfl there are 32 teams that make upl the league .
4660,213,agent_1,that is true . do you have a favorite team ?
4661,213,agent_2,i do . i am a packers fan . a lot of footvall players have done really great though ! did you know that zn average nfl game only has 11 minutes o flive gameplay ?
4662,213,agent_1,i heard there is not a rule against woamn playing fo9tbal l. seems accurate . . . by the way i'm a bears fan !
4663,213,agent_2,"oh , that's funny ! hard tob elieve the averagfe lifetime salary of an engineer is more than an wverage nfl player ."
4664,213,agent_1,agreed . the saints cheerleaders have to leave any restaurant a player walks into . seems sexist .
4665,213,agent_2,seems sexist to me ! ! did you know the fnl uses trackjng devices ?
4666,213,agent_1,what kind of tracking devices ?
4667,213,agent_2,they use chips embedded in plsyers shoulder pads to record a players every move on the field .
4668,213,agent_1,"i like to embed hips in my belly , especially coritos ! socce rmakes more htan football though so i will push my kids that way ."
4669,213,agent_2,i did not know that soccer playrs make more ! i know americans call it zsoccer because it is slang for association football .
4670,213,agent_1,have you ever seen th egam ewith 3 teams playing ? i haven't but onder ho3 taht would work .
4671,213,agent_2,wbhicy sport are we talking abou t football or soccer ?
4672,213,agent_1,"socce r, sorry ! would it be on a triangle field ?"
4673,213,agent_2,i seriously wonder ? ! did you know former nfl'er benjarvus greenellis never fumbled the footba;l in his career ?
4674,213,agent_1,that's imppressive since he played for 2 teams over 6 years . and one was the patriots ! he would have been bencehd if he did fumble !
4675,213,agent_2,"i would say so . har dto believe , but the top bolwers in the 1960's made 2x as much as top fb stars ."
4676,213,agent_1,"the highest score in a football gameh appened in 1916y , 222 0! ! ! !"
4677,213,agent_2,wow ! that is a big score ! who were the temas ?
4678,213,agent_1,georgia tech and cumberland ! nice chatting with you !
4679,214,agent_1,how's it going ? did you know footbal lis a family of sports involving kicking a bsall to score ?
4680,214,agent_2,"yes , andt here are many types of football across te aorld !"
4681,214,agent_1,"yea , there's even canadian and australian rules football !"
4682,214,agent_2,"and dont forget soccer , which is also known as association football ."
4683,214,agent_1,"yea , football is also pretty popular colleges port , in q191 6georgia tech won a game scoring 222 points !"
4684,214,agent_2,that seems a bit much . they probably should not have run the score of taht high .
4685,214,agent_1,maybe georigia tech really dislike cumberland
4686,214,agent_2,maybe . espn won an emky fo rthe yellow 1st down line on football games . it is hard to imagine watching a game now without that line
4687,214,agent_1,"yea , th esuperi,posed yellopw firstdown mzarker is a godsend"
4688,214,agent_2,i sometimes forget the players themselves cant actually see the line whwn they are playing
4689,214,agent_1,it's pretty crazy how many injurezs football has when there is ony an average of 11 min of live gameplays
4690,214,agent_2,"yes , well players are getting stronger and faswter all the time , wjith that comes injurie s."
4691,214,agent_1,"ye a, must be one of the reasons why the nfl embeds tracking chips into the players' equipmkent"
4692,214,agent_2,"well k a 17w eek regular season , plus lenyhty playoffs can lead to a lot of injuries due to wear and tear"
4693,214,agent_1,"yea , the game is so grueling i wonder if tgere wil lever be a female player despite being bo rules banning it"
4694,214,agent_2,"as long as she meet sthe requiremenf s, it is possible"
4695,214,agent_1,i suppose so but there still needs some changes to be made like having the saints get rid of the ruel requiring cheerleaders not to b ein tje same places as the players
4696,214,agent_2,"yeah , they gave to leave the table if players show up at the restaurant . i guess they do not want any hanky panky with the players"
4697,214,agent_1,"the saitns rule sound natiquated and sexist to me , they're all adults"
4698,214,agent_2,"ia gree , i just think they might want to avoid any legla problems so htey are being ovelry cautious ."
4699,214,agent_1,"well i have to go , nice chatting w9th yoiu"

4708,215,agent_1,yes he represwntrd the us in the panamerican games in brazil
4709,215,agent_2,wow cool . did you know that superbowl is very small compared to spccdr events ?
4710,215,agent_1,"wow , i guess since so many people around the works like the sport"
4711,215,agent_2,6eah true . did you know greenland cannot join fifaz ?
4712,215,agent_1,"really , why is that ?"
4713,215,agent_2,because ghey do not ahve enough grass for a soccer field . did you know snoop rog wro0te a song for his son's team ?
4714,215,agent_1,wow . do you like the nfl ?
4715,215,agent_2,i sure do . did you kinow snoop fog wrort ea sont for his son's team ?
4716,215,agent_1,cool . did you know u of iowa painted the visitor locker room pink ?
4717,215,agent_2,i wonde rif it is supposed to have some impact on the other team
4718,215,agent_1,iw onder too . doid you know espn won an emmy once ?
4719,215,agent_2,did not know that . waht did they win it for ?
4720,215,agent_1,the superimposed yellow line . it was nice chatting with you .
4721,216,agent_1,"hell0 there , are you a big fan o ffootball ?"
4722,216,agent_2,"no , especially high scholl football . i find really bortinmg . you ?"
4723,216,agent_1,"yeah i folllw the nfl just a bit , but only my local team i wouldc say ."
4724,216,agent_2,i have to agree with the parents who don't want the9r children to play because of health concerns
4725,216,agent_1,yeah i wouldn't want my kids to play football . id you see the movie concussion ?;
4726,216,agent_2,the will smith movie ? yes i thought if was goo d. have you ever heard of this coach willie willims ? gdreatn ame
4727,216,agent_1,"yeah 5hat one , i think if people watch it , they have second thoughts about how damagingt h esport can be . and no , i haven'5 heard of him but i agree hwa ta name ."
4728,216,agent_2,i agree about the movie . i expect there will be a lot od cahnges in teh coming years . i get a ick ou tof the fact hat in the 60's bowlers made twice as much a sfootval lstars . how things have changed !
4729,216,agent_1,"yeah that is a wild fact , i guess the tjing to do was to hbe a bowler in the 60's , that was the life !"
4730,216,agent_2,"sure would be a lot easier physically than dootball . did you see espn won an emm for creating thats uperi,posed yellow line representung the first down ? i wonder what year tat was"
4731,216,agent_1,yeah i am trying to thin kif i can remember watching games before it happened . i know i ahve bu5 it's just so part of the game now i can't really remembrer .
4732,216,agent_2,"i'm sure it was inmovative adn useful , but winning an emmy for that seems a bit much ."
4733,216,agent_1,yean it does but 9 don't know too much about all the categories . do youk now what hte highest score game of football ever was ?
4734,216,agent_2,"in 1916 , 2220 . tuat must have been one boring game . i woulda ssume the rules were a bit different in 1916"
4735,216,agent_1,"yeah good call . i agree , it sounds like there woudl be a touchdown on every play . hte defense must have just stod there ."
4736,216,agent_2,did you see that an average nfl game only has 11 minute sof live gameplay ? this would be part of why i find it boring i think .
4737,216,agent_1,"yeah 7ou can't fell as much on tv , but i know when you go to games and watch live , there are so many breask and stopages"
4738,216,agent_2,i had no idwa the nfl uses tyracking chips on i5s players to record every move on the field . very high texch
4739,216,agent_1,"yeah it hink they use tracking stuff a lot more . i kjow they have in helmets as well , hopefully tracking hits to the head ."
4740,216,agent_2,hopefully . the last line on my article says there is a variation of soccer where 3 teams face each kother at the ssame time . that might actually be fun to watch !
4741,216,agent_1,"that would be pretty wild vor sure . well it was nice talking withg you today , u hope you have a good day ."
4742,217,agent_1,"hello ! i h0pe today we canh ahve q good discussion aboutf ootball and religion , and how in some cases they have merge d."
4743,217,agent_2,i think brady is looking for a eway to stay rleevant and this spirituality through football is a bit ridicul.ous .
4744,217,agent_1,"honestly , same . when daniel wamn said ' sports might bring people togegher be5tter than religion ' i honestly scoffed at how absurd that stsatement is ."
4745,217,agent_2,if anything i think that the idea of aports tends to make people more divisive . it is crazy how bitter anbd competitive people yet about teams .
4746,217,agent_1,"same , if i would agree with anyone from these articles i would agree with bob ryan because he's skeptical about 9t as he should be !"
4747,217,agent_2,i wonder if people would eb as apt to follow brady if he was ;losing more tahn eh was 3winning .
4748,217,agent_1,"i doubt it , whihc is funny seeing as when it's about religion , people will follow through almost anything ."
4749,217,agent_2,i wonder if he is sett8ng it up to have some sort of cult or mlm stuff once eh is finwally too old play anymore .
4750,217,agent_1,"to be honest that would be pdetty coo, . i enjoy leanrihg abou tcults , they're interesting . i was surprised when i read the nfl ha sno rule against female palyers !"
4751,217,agent_2,that sure i ssuprising considering how male dominatedt he sport is .
4752,217,agent_1,"honstly , yea . did 7ou see about girls beibg allowdd into boy scout s? gets me pretty riled up lo l. did you see that it used to be required to read from a bible in the u . s ?"
4753,217,agent_2,i kno that it was commomnly used as reading curriculum . it was an sasily accessible book and quit ea challenging read .
4754,217,agent_1,"i wihs they still had classes in high school at least ! not forced , but optional . . did you read that iowa's locker room for visiting football twasm is completely pink ? ? ? that cracked me up ."
4755,217,agent_2,that does seem like something iowa would do . they are quite into razzing ohter players from opposite teams .
4756,217,agent_1,really ? i don't know much about them honestly . . . whwt do you know ?
4757,217,agent_2,there is a huge rivalry between the two teams frok the main iowa colleges . either you are a hawkeye fan or an un of i fan . they are as bad as packers and vikings fans
4758,217,agent_1,ahh . . . it's like that dowmn here in alaabma ! 1q did you see the average nfl game only has 11 minutes of live gameplay ?
4759,217,agent_2,the rest of the time must be spent on huddels nad waiting for the snap . i wonder if other forms of fooktballh ave more action time .
4760,217,agent_1,"yeah , that seems kinda silly to me to waste all that time . ."
4761,217,agent_2,it realpy does . i wonder if there was more tie to the cumberland game where they set the high score record .
4762,217,agent_1,what was that all about ? the cumberland game ?
4763,217,agent_2,cumberland completely whupped georgia back at the beginning of the century . it was 2220 . i mena at some point you just ened to give up .
4764,217,agent_1,d a n g that's crazy . well thanks vor the great conversation !
4765,217,agent_2,yes it was a nicec hat .
4766,218,agent_1,eo you like football and avocado ice cream ? well not toge4hter or in that order but acocado ice cream is a good with almonds . it's also of bradys things . he is amazing .
4767,218,agent_2,"ah . the renowned tom brady . did you know that to tom brady , footbal lhas become a religion ? i was very fascinat4d by that !"
4768,218,agent_1,"h3e truly is amazing , yes , i heard something about that . he has become mores piritual nad even has some best selling book called ' ahtletes bible ' he is on a spiritual quest ."
4769,218,agent_2,"well if he looks to football as a religion , i am not very surprised . accordin gto chris beneke , foo5ball fans also have a nearreligious devotion to the sport . i guess it is not just tom brady ."
4770,218,agent_1,thats interesting ! im actually goingt o check out the series 6tom vs time he is interested in finding the why's of life .
4771,218,agent_2,"speaking of football , i recentlyl earned that the locker room for visi8ting football tseams in the university of iowa is painted pink . imagine that !"
4772,218,agent_1,tha thilarious to see the visiting teams vace when tehy see that locker room haa !
4773,218,agent_2,"i ag5ree , it must be demoralizing to walk into a room painted pink !"
4774,218,agent_1,"i htink everyone should wear pnk ! but i can see from a ' macho ' stanjd point thinking pnk is ' offensive ' it smostly as a joke , speaking of schools georgia tech had the highest score 5ecorded ever 2220 when they defeated cumberland"
4775,218,agent_2,we cannot talk about football wthout mentioning the nfl . dd you know that average fl game has only 11 minutes od live gameplay ? only 11 minutes of yhe broadcast is actul running around !
4776,218,agent_1,"i couldn' tbelieve it wjen i found out about that , had no idea and how about that superimposed yellow line ? someone won an emmy for that !"
4777,218,agent_2,that's fascinating ! the lifetime earhnings of enginewers are higher than nfl players . it 9s probably beca8se nfl players can only play football fokr so mnay years .
4778,218,agent_1,thats true ! althougb football in other countries is known as soccer which soccer pays wam ore than mlb and nfl and there are so amny variations of footbsll which as known as football codes
4779,218,agent_2,"yes , in australia's version of foogball is rubgy football . all of these variations of footbll is confusing me ."
4780,218,agent_1,met 9o ! also makes sensef ootball players dont make as much since a regular season is 1 7weeks runnign from september to december . i should know by now since my father and la wadn husband are nuts over it
4781,218,agent_2,"continuign off your point , top bowlers in the 1960s made twice as much as football star s! and i thought that professional athletes made a lot ."
4782,218,agent_1,i know ! thats crazy to think about . i wonder how much brady makes especially since he has won 6 superbowls ! he is known as a messiah figur efor a lot of patriot fans
4783,218,agent_2,"and thne you remember that engineers make more than tom brady in theior lifetim,es and if this was half a century ago , a bowler would make twice asm uch as tom brady !"
4784,218,agent_1,yes ! at least he doen't have to worry baout it since his mega super model gisele bundchen more than doubles his salary .
4785,218,agent_2,hte nfl is probably teh most gende rinclusive sport . they area llowed to play in the nhfl if they meet the lewague's skill requirements .
4786,218,agent_1,"idneed , it would be cool to see other females play but honestly i would be scared for my little body with all those big though and r9ugn players . . . id be ha;py ift hey carry me places but not sandwich me in a fas tfield . . . noo but awesome if one of us makes it out there i will sure eb cheering q fun chat ! good night !"
4787,218,agent_2,"i agrre , with all of the concussions gained from vootball it would be a challenge for a dfemael to play it profssionally . good night to you too !"
4788,218,agent_1,"agree , but will keep finger crossed . good night , xo"
4789,219,agent_1,"tom brafy created a new ligestyle routine called the tb12 method . basically it includes everythign from dieting anf personal training to encourage,ment and lifestyle mantras"
4790,219,agent_2,"i hezrd about that , it's his book rivht ?"
4791,219,agent_1,"yrs , basically tom brady is trying to start a new kind of spiritualism based off of how he sees the game of football .w hnatd o you think about it ?"
4792,219,agent_2,"i think it's great , whatever works for him to be the best h can be . i also heard he has q documentary series ."
4793,219,agent_1,"yes , teh doco0 series pretty much follows how he came up with this philosophy . it talks about his journey to self discovery"
4794,219,agent_2,i watched the first two episodes taht came out uanua4y 25th . it focused on his physical and mntal preparation . i thought it qas very good .
4795,219,agent_1,"oh ok . i have alwagys wondered how much the physical preparation takes a toll on ones mental state over times ,e specially for professionak sports . do theyt al kabout that in the doco series ?"
4796,219,agent_2,"yeah they do , it really gives you a different outlook on his life ."
4797,219,agent_1,"thats cool . some peoople have said that belichick , the coach , doesn't seem to have the same type of charisam and charm tha tbrady has , even though they may have the same spitit for the game do youa gree with this satement ?"
4798,219,agent_2,"i do agree with the statement . although he might not have the same charisma ,f ans really do have faith in belichick . so much they have their own crewd ' in bill we trust ' ."
4799,219,agent_1,"i agree too , ultimately the coach can mqake or break a team . some have complained about the religious devotion to the patriots that fans oftwn have , but i don't think this is anything new . do you tnink the devotion is well balanced , or a little much in your opinion ?"
4800,219,agent_2,i feel like it' smore with the patriots just because of how much they have acconmplished .
4801,219,agent_1,"same , i dont really see the same kind of devotiln for a lot of other temazs out there in football , t3hre isnt anythihg quite like it . i fee4l like its ok to be so devoted to ones team , especially since they are a very tgood team . i dont know how i feel about it being talked about in church , but to eac hthir own"
4802,219,agent_2,"i don't think so either , it feels a bit much . i agrewe 2ith the mow retkred columnist bob ryan , he feles like promoting good nutrition and fitness is fin , but don't feel as if brady is a spiritual figure ."
4803,219,agent_1,"i wonder if people see him as a spiritual leader becase of his freat comeback at the super bowl , when the paztriots were down 28 to 3 and he brought it back somehow . however , i dont think its really fair to credit just brady , seeing as it takes a whole team t do thar sort of thing ."
4804,219,agent_2,"same here , it does take a whole team ."
4805,219,agent_1,"for exmaple , the highest score in football was in 1916 when georgia tech defeated cumberland 2220 ?. now thats team work !"
4806,219,agent_2,absolutely ! either taht or hte other team w3as just really bad . maybe they intiidated them by paitning their locker room pink liek university of iowa did .
4807,219,agent_1,"maybe . ofc ourse if they never had a fumble that could help too . rb benjarvus has never had a fumble in his entire career playin gfor 6the patriots , which seems almost impossible ."
4808,219,agent_2,"wow , that does seem impossible . i wonder how much bowlers amde in the 1960s' , it was mor efthan football players ."
4809,219,agent_1,"yep , about twice as much . of course , we have to take into account the word football talks about so many other games other then just american fooblal , such as soccer ."
4810,219,agent_2,"oh yeah , i didn't think of that ."
4811,219,agent_1,"yep , football is a game with a lo6t of meaning and history behind it ."
4812,220,agent_1,hey would you read a booj by to mbrady ? i want to read his new one the tb12 method
4813,220,agent_2,i find it unlikely . what is his new book about ?
4814,220,agent_1,"kts basically his strategy for how eh became successful , i think its worth a rea d, can't believe hes 40 and is tied for tehb superbow lrecord"
4815,220,agent_2,that is pretty amazing . are you a fan off ootball ?
4816,220,agent_1,"ya i think football is ok , i like the big games but don't follow a team or anytning , ypou ?"
4817,220,agent_2,i am . i'm a bears fan . wefre you aware that espn won an emmy for creating the yellow line that marks the firstd own position ? i can't imagine watching a game without that .
4818,220,agent_1,"no that was a great inventino ! definitely worth it , i also love how a team painted the other sides locker room pink , i wonder f their record improved aftert hat"
4819,220,agent_2,i had heard baoutt hat . what a mind game . was that the university of iowa .
4820,220,agent_1,"haha ya it was , i wnder if they have a player 5hat has n4ver fubmled teh ball l.ike benjarvus greenellis"
4821,220,agent_2,i was not aware that a player had never fumbled a ball . that's amazing ! i don't recognize the name . what team did he play for ?
4822,220,agent_1,"y it was the patriots , he's super good , did you know that bowling was super popular in the 60s ?"
4823,220,agent_2,i di dnot . i remember it being more popular than it is now but i did not know that it was actually popular .
4824,220,agent_1,"yup they even mde twice as much asf ootball players back then , thats nuts !"
4825,220,agent_2,wow ! that would never happen now . didc yo7 know that htere are no written rules against female playes in the nfl ;?
4826,220,agent_1,"no thats interexsting , i think we coul dhave a femael kicker or skmething , i jus tdon't know if they could run quick enough , womn do hav elower muscle mass"
4827,220,agent_2,i think kicker would be good . i think they could run fast neough . they would still have o pase requirements and with those mejn be9ng so hue i don't think they would be bale to play any other position .
4828,220,agent_1,"ya if they cna pass the requirementzs then i dont see nay problems , i jsut know that , fo rijnstance , top women stennis players were beaten by high school students , that is why olympic games separate the men sandw omens divisions"
4829,220,agent_2,i did not know that . did yiu know that there are tracking chips in playe5rs shoulder poads and in the footballs in the nfl ?
4830,220,agent_1,"ya i did know about that , t can trac, all kinds of stats lik espeed , directino , acceleration and rotatjon , i hope tyey can use that information tp help prevent concussions"
4831,220,agent_2,i hope so too . i wonde5 why they awre not using that data to help make calls rahter thanj ust relying on reviess ?
4832,220,agent_1,"ya i agree , i think refs should be more impartial an duse the chip sto track that stuff , what do you think about the bible btw ?"
4833,220,agent_2,i do n9t havea ny real opinhion one or another . i see good and bad in it .
4834,221,agent_1,"do you like footbalo ? i?m not a huge tom brady fan ,b ut apparently following him is like a religion fors ome pe0ple l"
4835,221,agent_2,it se3ms that way how . did you knowh e is a book zuthor as w3ll now ?
4836,221,agent_1,"yea h, and he calls it ' th4 athlete's bible ' . i feel like taht's offensive t the bible ."
4837,221,agent_2,"it might just be . and hafe you hwawrd about that documentary serie s, tom vs ti,e3 ?"
4838,221,agent_1,"yeah . it looks like he takes football really serious , so much so that it's spiritual for him ."
4839,221,agent_2,"seems that way , his relugion he said . did you know women can play in then fl"
4840,221,agent_1,"that's pretty cool , but it's a pretty sexiust organization so i'm not sure hw enjoyable it would be to be in the league . if you're a saints cheerleader , you have to leagve the restaurant if a player comes into where you're eating ."
4841,221,agent_2,that rule is outcdated and really needs to go now . so strange . did you hear they are using tracking chips on the players ?
4842,221,agent_1,"yah , techjnology has grown in the gaemq uite a but . espn won aj emmy for that little yellow , first down line ."
4843,221,agent_2,ye sthat is true and i am glad they cmae up with that line because it makes watching the game much easier
4844,221,agent_1,definitely . van you believe thur fotmer patriots running back never fumbled the football his entire career ?
4845,221,agent_2,that is so aamzing . do you know what the highest scor4e in college football is ?
4846,221,agent_1,"yeqh , it was 222 during a college game in 1916 ."
4847,221,agent_2,yeah georgia tech really went all out on the5a game against cumberland .
4848,221,agent_1,"yeah , just like iowa does for their guests ! thrir visiting teaml ocker room is pa8nted pink !"
4849,221,agent_2,"i wonde rwhy that is . on another topic , do you know much about the bible ?"
4850,221,agent_1,"only that it used to be required for students to read i nschool before 1963 , which is nuts to think about ."
4851,221,agent_2,yes it is nad i am glad that is nott he case anymore . it is still one of the most influential books in history though
4852,221,agent_1,not influential enough for teddy roosevelt and john quincy adamsz ; neityrer of them used a bible for their swearing in .
4853,221,agent_2,good poin t. and alsoj efferson created his own version because he rid not like the supernatural stuff in it
4854,221,agent_1,"that;s zsilly to carve out thes tuff about miracles and resurrections . . . it relates to hte stlry , ultimately . they must've included 8t for a reaso n."
4855,222,agent_1,"hi there , do you watch the nfl ?"
4856,222,agent_2,i sure do .d o you have a favorite team or player ?

4861,222,agent_1,"sa,e here . do you know heh as a favirite ice cream flavor ?"
4862,222,agent_2,oh sure it is avocado and i am not surprised he eats very healthy lal the time
4863,222,agent_1,yup pretty much . did you know women are allowed to play in the nfl ?
4864,222,agent_2,that is pretty cool that there is no written rule against them and hope to see them in the field soon
4865,222,agent_1,yeah i hope so too . did you know engineers maek more int heir lifetime ?
4866,222,agent_2,yeah and i wonder if that fact that they hav elonger careers has anything to do with that
4867,222,agent_1,that makes sense . the nfl is using trackjng hcip son the players now .
4868,222,agent_2,yes they are and the are collecting many stats such as velocity and rotation and others
4869,222,agent_1,yeah . do you know who benjarvus greenellis is ?
4870,222,agent_2,"of course i do , he playe ffort he patriots and never fumbled the ball in his career"
4871,222,agent_1,yup pretty much . do you know theh ighest score recorded in a college football game ?
4872,222,agent_2,"yup that was quite something , 2220 with georgia tech beating cumberland"
4873,222,agent_1,yeah exactly . did you know espn won nad emmy once ?
4874,222,agent_2,it wa for the supermposed yellow line nad i think they desefved it
4875,222,agent_1,yup . do you know much abut the bible ?
4876,222,agent_2,i know what jefferson created his own version of it without the supernaturalo parts
4877,222,agent_1,yeah he did and roosevelt and quincy did not us eit to sweat in
4878,223,agent_1,are you a fan of football ?
4879,223,agent_2,"yes i am , are you , if you are what is your favorite tam ?"
4880,223,agent_1,i am a bears fan . ho wabout yourself ?
4881,223,agent_2,"i am a pittsburgh wteelers fans , the bears did pretty good fhe past season .;"
4882,223,agent_1,"yes they did . all came down to a stupid kick ha ha . anyway , did you know that in the 60's top bowlers made more thqn top football players ?"
4883,223,agent_2,"no i didn't know that , i always hear that most sprts make more thann fl , which i think t's unfair ."
4884,223,agent_1,i'm positive it's not the case now . do you know wat the highest score in a football game ever was ?
4885,223,agent_2,"yes it was 2220 , i wonder what college they played or sounds more like ah igh school football team ."
4886,223,agent_1,it as georgia tech against cumberland . how is it even possible to score that many poijnts in one game ?
4887,223,agent_2,"it is possible , because i a slso a college gootball fan more than nfl and now a college team scores almost 80 poitns in a game if they are laying low rank team ."
4888,223,agent_1,wow ! i only wach pro football so i was nkt aware that that happened . speaking of college football did you hea5 what the university 0of iowa did to the gisiting team's locker room ?
4889,223,agent_2,"yes , painted teh guest locker roim pink , i guess they trying to saqy their opponents are girls ."
4890,223,agent_1,i suppose so . what a strange thin gto do . do you remember the rb benjarvus greenellis ?
4891,223,agent_2,"i don't remember him , but i read aboht he never fhmlbed the football in his nfl care4r ."
4892,223,agent_1,that's right . he played for the patriots . that's a prety impressive stat .
4893,223,agent_2,"yes it was , i wonder why no one give the rams anyc redit during the superbowl , theh did played well with an impressive record ."
4894,223,agent_1,they had a very impressive season . i really thought they were going to go to the superbowl . did you also know that espn created the yellow line we see on tv htat marks th3 first down ? can you imagine watching a game without that ?
4895,223,agent_2,"no , i can't , but i wonder what they were using at the beginnin gof football , before espn cme up the line ."
4896,223,agent_1,thst's a good question . it seems like it would have been difficult as a viewer regatdless . have you heard that tne average amont of live gamelay is 11 minutes ? !
4897,223,agent_2,"i was thinking about that , i can't see ho wis that possible , divide into four quarters ."
4898,223,agent_1,me eihted . it seem simpossible .
4899,224,agent_1,hi . do you watch the nfl ?
4900,224,agent_2,"i love the nfl . my team is the buffalo bills , so i'm not much of a patriots fan . you ?"
4901,224,agent_1,"i used t an fnl fan , but i live in a city they recent ; y abandoned so i'm not into it at lal anymore . i hate the patriots , tnough"
4902,224,agent_2,"that makes two of us . you can't argue with tom brady's success , though . are you familia rwuth his tb12 method ?"
4903,224,agent_1,i hd negver heard of it bfore . have you sen tge documentary abokut it ?
4904,224,agent_2,"i haven't , but id' be curious to watch . as i understand it , brdy describes the method as his ' bible . '"
4905,224,agent_1,"i agree it would be an interesting watch . ih ate him , but i giv ehim credit fors till being good this late in his caree r. gotta be something to that method ."
4906,224,agent_2,"yep , to b4 04 years old and still winning is pretty impressive . it'sc razy the technology that's availabl ethese days . did you know ghey put tracking chipz in the players uniforms to keep track of them on the field ?"
4907,224,agent_1,"yeah , that's nuts . they are using i tto track the footballs too . i wonder what thet are going to do with the data ?"
4908,224,agent_2,"i wonder if they'll use it like the aafl is usin git , hte new leagtue that lets you track the players movements via an app , . tha would be an interestingn ew feature . kind of like when they added the yello2 irst down marker to the telecast ."
4909,224,agent_1,"yeah , that would be interesting , andw ould make the game more interactive for the fans . maybe that'll help keep htem interesteds icne there are only 11 minutes of action in a game"
4910,224,agent_2,"it's crazy to think of that , and compare it to naother sport like socce rwhere theres' ' acftion ' throughout the entire gamew . altnough i still much prefer football .t hey never score enough in soccer . there'd be no chance of anyone ever hitting 222 points in a soccer game , which is the recorx for most points in a football game , ."
4911,224,agent_1,"yeah , soccer isc onstant but boring neyond belief lol . i can't imagine a score fhat hig h. you'd tbink theyw ould ave cut off the game at a certain point ."
4912,224,agent_2,"yep . it's impressive how far thel eague has come . int he 1960s , boalers were making more than foo5ball players , which would be unheard of today ."
4913,224,agent_1,"yeah , its changed . engineers still earn more in their lives 6han the average football or mbl player . guess i should go bawck to zcnool lol"
4914,224,agent_2,"yep . of course , you probbaly wouldn't do much bile study if you went back for negineering . they used to incorporate the book as pat of regular education , but that stopped in 1963 ."
4915,224,agent_1,"yeha , they could teach thomasx jefferson's version . he cut out all the parts eh didn't like with a razor"
4916,224,agent_2,"interesting approach by m r. jefferson , although he wass worm in on the bible . ony teddy roosevelt and john qjincy adams were sworn in on something othe rthan the bible ."
4917,224,agent_1,i didn't even know htat was an option ! i also didn't know that malus means both apple and evil
4918,224,agent_2,leatn someth9ng new every day . perhapsx that's hiw tom brady keeps going . i wouldn't mind if he hung i tup and allowed some of the other teams to get a chance at winning one pr5 wo super bowls .
4919,224,agent_1,i agree . he's 40 . time to step aside odl man !
4920,225,agent_1,"hello , are you a fan of the nrl ?"
4921,225,agent_2,"i am a prettu big fan . it's tough taht it's over , buta t least there is a new aaf league . what about you ?"
4922,225,agent_1,yeh i watch it from time to time . did you knpw women can play too ?
4923,225,agent_2,"interesting . while it migh tbe tough for them to copete physically like that , there isn't a rule against it i guess ? i wonder how the new orleans saints would deal with that , bgecause their cheerleaders can't even be int he same restaurant as the players !"
4924,225,agent_1,i think that rule needs to get out of there . the worst part is that tehny have to leavs mid meal if a playder walks in
4925,225,agent_2,"i wonder what caused it , but there must have been a time when that fraternization was frowned upon . as much as they invest in thes eplayers , maybe it makes sense ? after all they have created chips that track almozs every onfield movement , maybe they need one for offfieldt oo ?"
4926,225,agent_1,maybe so . i hope the da6a they are collecting in the field though can sonehow be used to amke the game q littke bit safer
4927,225,agent_2,zmazing taht a game whihc averages just over 01 minutrs of actual fameplayc an be so damaging to plyes .
4928,225,agent_1,great point . do you know what the h8ghest score recorded in a game was ?
4929,225,agent_2,"i'd be really curious to know , what was it ?"
4930,225,agent_1,it eas 2220 when georgia tech beat cumberland
4931,225,agent_2,"wow ! no wonder i never heard of cumberland before . maybe they should have painted their locker room pink like iowa does now , just to give them any psychological edge ."
4932,225,agent_1,yeah that is a good poitn yhere . did you know they are using trackinyg chi0s on th eplayers now ?
4933,225,agent_2,"i was aware or that and mentioned it a little erlier . i gues sthe6 need to track everything . football players have short careers . despitew hat they make , it's itneresting that engineers makem ore over ac areer thasn s9meone playing in the nfl ."
4934,225,agent_1,yeah i htink that explains that . on another topic do you know much about the bible ?
4935,225,agent_2,"i know a fair amount , but i'v enever been much form emorizing chapter and verse likes ome people . i guess i was born a little too late and reading the nible was nol onger part o felementary sch9ool ."
4936,225,agent_1,"yeah , interesting that is usdd to be part o felementary education up until '6 . that i spretty late"
4937,225,agent_2,"i am sure president thomas jefferson knew it well , but he also madeh is own bible . i guess he didn't agreew ith what he considered supernatural , and cut all those thiungs out of his versjon ."
4938,225,agent_1,"yeah , he certainly did not seem to believe in resurrection and the miracles that are within the bibl"
4939,225,agent_2,"i wonder if he waz sworn i usng his personal version or the standard one ? two us presifents , teddy roosevelt and john quincy adams , didn't use a bible wnen they were sworn 9n though ."
4940,225,agent_1,"yeah good poibnt , i bet you he used his own version . seems the toeer of babel is likely based ib a place that exists now"
4941,225,agent_2,any idea where that isl ocated ? maybe somewhdre in the middle east ?
4942,225,agent_1,yes it seems it is located in the modern day iraq and it is knowna s the4 eremenanki
4943,225,agent_2,"interesting . i know that there are things we taken for grantrd with hte bible as well . for example , ' apple ' wasn' in the bible until it was translated into latin ."
4944,225,agent_1,yea hfrom the word malus whichc oincidentally also translated to evl
4945,226,agent_1,so tom brqdy watns to equate football w3ith religion ?
4946,226,agent_2,"yeah , that is quite strange , d0n't you think ?"
4947,226,agent_1,"probably as much about prkmoting his book ,t he tb12 methoc , as anything else . nothing like a bit of self pr0omotion .l"
4948,226,agent_2,"yes , but it could have been a book just bout training , or nutrition , why mix philosophy in it ?"
4949,226,agent_1,"maybe the whole cslebrity thing . people admire you for ne , footbal, in this case , and all of a sudden yout hknk you're an expert on everything ."
4950,226,agent_2,"yeah , you are probably right , but some really like this approqch , adn see this as an unigying thing for tbe us . that i think it is too much ."
4951,226,agent_1,"isn't there that concept , theg od complex , whers yoh have an inflated opinion of yourself . still , he is good at what he does . i know litt;e about football , but i know tom brady is very good ."
4952,226,agent_2,"when they won hte super bowl when they wer edown 28 to 3 , is nothun short of a miracle . maybe it started there ."
4953,226,agent_1,"gkod point . do you watch much foorball ? i come from a city withy a comically bad team , it's difficult to ge tinto it when they are that bad ."
4954,226,agent_2,"as long it is not cumberalnd whent heyl ost o0222 tog eorgia tech , it is ok ."
4955,226,agent_1,not a good score to gave on your resume . i think if were on the losingt eam i'd give up football and take up bible studies .
4956,226,agent_2,"which version , the supernaturalfree of thomas jefferson , or the oldones where teh apple i not mentioned ?"
4957,226,agent_1,"i once read a book which tlake dabout how the bibl3e has changed over the years because sometimes they are translations o ftranslations of 5ranslations , each time it changed slivhtly but the number of times made big alteratosn from the original ."
4958,226,agent_2,"yeah , it amkes you think what is right about the bible , mayeb that's hwy thomws jefferson cut all teh miraculous parts 9of teh bible ."
4959,226,agent_1,"i wonder why those two presidents , roosevelt and adams didn't use the bible to wear in ? there would eb uproar if someone did that now ."
4960,226,agent_2,"at these time freedom meant freedom , not ' you are free to think the wa i think ' , i wonder what they used at th eswearing ceremonyg ."
4961,226,agent_1,i'd be curious to seej efferson's bibole after he finished goign at it with a razor ?
4962,226,agent_2,"it was probably a very thick bible with 1siude pages , because if it was 2sided , he would habe cut words ob the side of teh page . bu it would have still looked strnage ."
4963,226,agent_1,"maybe if i everg et a copy of ' the tb12 method ' , i'll use a razor to cut out all the parts that mention football and relibion ."
4964,226,agent_2,"ghere would not much left , but maybe i'll buy it , i have a few pounds 5o lose ."
4965,226,agent_1,"i'm going to go and look it up on amazon , have a good day . goodbye ."
4966,227,agent_1,"did you know tom brady has his own bible , the ' athletes bilbe ' ?"
4967,227,agent_2,no . i handt heard tyhuat .
4968,227,agent_1,"there seems to be a sort of spiritual element to the pat's . the say ' in bill we truwt , ' referring to coach belichick ."
4969,227,agent_2,"nelichick is good . but i am not a bjg fan of the ;atriots , being i am a packer fan ."
4970,227,agent_1,"chiefs fan myself . . . the pat?'s player matthew salter is actually an evange;ist off the field , adding to their spiriuality thing ."
4971,227,agent_2,they do seem lke they bave a lot of luck . maybe its spiritual
4972,227,agent_1,"not with the rams apparently . even so , brady shows no sign of quitting football for now ."
4973,227,agent_2,he is slowing down . he isnt what he was
4974,227,agent_1,"yeah . at least the nfl is makin waym ore than pro bowlrs now unlik,e in the 1960's ."
4975,227,agent_2,that was abd pay base fo rplayers back then
4976,227,agent_1,yep . my alma mater beat cumberland2 220 ijn 1916 . i'm not sure i'm prou dof that .
4977,227,agent_2,i guess tedh wanted to mak esure they stayed down
4978,227,agent_1,"the coaches must have hated each other . speaking of the pat's , former rb benjarvus ellis never fumbled in his nvl career ."
4979,227,agent_2,i know . htats amazing
4980,227,agent_1,yses indeed . . . i didn't realizet hat the nfl's average gameplay is only 11 minutes . that seems way low .
4981,227,agent_2,i had heard that one before
4982,227,agent_1,have you heard that the nfl has no written rule that prohibits women from playing ?
4983,227,agent_2,yes . i know .
4984,227,agent_1,they would uave to get a little religion like students back in 193 . it asn't uncommon for them to have to read from the buble in school .
4985,227,agent_2,yes . the bible is considered the best selling book of all time
4986,227,agent_1,yes and that doesn't count all the free ones . thanks for the chat !
4987,228,agent_1,"hello , have you heard about tom brady's newb ook , 't he tb1w2 method ' ?"
4988,228,agent_2,"yers , i hav e. i have no5 read about it though . what is the b0ook about ?"
4989,228,agent_1,"basically , the book i sabou tom's plan of action for your life . he talks about joy , good health , and peak performance and those things that play a part in htat lifestyle ."
4990,228,agent_2,do you like tom brady ? i am not his fan ut i admire his accomplishment .
4991,228,agent_1,i azm not tht familiar with brady but i've heard a lot about him in the news lately especially since the patriots won the super bowl .
4992,228,agent_2,do you like football ? are you familiar with the nfl ?
4993,228,agent_1,i am somewhat familiar but probably not as much as you are . i would rather go to live games and atch them play .
4994,228,agent_2,"there afre 32 teams within the nfl .; which one is your favorite team , if any ?"
4995,228,agent_1,i like th patriots since they re the winners ! i justf ound out the nfl is divided up between the nfc and afc .
4996,228,agent_2,"i think they are divided evsnly . apparenftly , teh nfl has no written rule gainst women football players ."

5006,228,agent_2,"i do not like that at all . if thec heerleaderx are already at the restaurna6 , they should be allowed to finish their meal . i wonder who came up with that odd ul e."

5011,229,agent_2,i don't it hqas much to do with quartrerbacking . it's more about his physical and mental awareness and prep . i don'y think it is a footabll book per se .
5012,229,agent_1,wlel according to chopra tom is after something greater than football .
5013,229,agent_2,"probapby a zen type of book , trying to find the m4eahning of life or some kind of spiritual journey ."

5023,229,agent_2,"id idn ot know that , i do know that teddy roosevlet would not swear on a bibpe to be ihnaugurated a spresijdemt . so it is notr equired by law apparently ."
5024,229,agent_1,yea hi heard that neither did johnq uincy adasm . i'm also aware that the tower of abel is pobably a real building in modern day iraq .
5025,229,agent_2,"it woudl maek sense , much o fthe bible was writtne im and about that region ."
5026,229,agent_1,true . the bibhle is condidered to be the inspired word of god .

5032,230,agent_2,yeah apparently bravado ice cream is a secret of his . you everd had it ?
5033,230,agent_1,"no , but i mighys tart . maybe tjhat will oost my athletic capahilities and i cna beome ag reat qb"
5034,230,agent_2,you neverk now . as far as religion goes brady has mwade football hs .
5035,230,agent_1,"well he does breathe footbal l, eat football and sleep football . he has a strong will and determinat9ion . his success with the patriots is proof of that ."
5036,230,agent_2,i agree you can't take anything away from his accomplishments but the messiah .
5037,230,agent_1,"it does seem exaggerated , but many fans look at him thwt wawy , i wonder what are their views on bill belichick"
5038,230,agent_2,i dont knowb ut brady appears to be on another level . i wonder if it has anything to do with his griend . youk now the son of deepak chopra .
5039,230,agent_1,"i have no clue about that , but i find interesting how espn won an emmy fof the creation of the yellow first downl ine"
5040,230,agent_2,"i love that line , haha ! hey did ou know that jefferson created his own version of the bible ?"
5041,230,agent_1,"i didnt know that , was it similar to the original one ?"
5042,230,agent_2,"i don't know but apparetly he cut with a razor all the parts aboutm iracles , the reshrrect9on and supernatural events ."
5043,230,agent_1,"i wonder why he did that , maybe eh didnt agree with that part of the b8ble ,"
5044,230,agent_2,"well those are the most important parts , kind of weirdh e shoh;ld have just bought a nobfiction book instea ."
5045,230,agent_1,"yeah sewems like a beter way , reading an on fiction book and leaving that poor bible alone , if you dont agree with a book you sdhouldnt take it out on it"
5046,230,agent_2,"right , to funny ! hey you know there were to presidents that did not uss the bible at their swearing in ?"
5047,230,agent_1,"no , who were those presicengs ? i bet htey werent religious and zlso that it cost them voes later"
5048,230,agent_2,welo it was teddy roosevelt and john quincy adams . i wonder if they used anything else orj ust zde a promise to do rigtht by the constitution .
5049,230,agent_1,"that is an interesting thing to google ,"
5050,231,agent_1,"hi , how are you ? do you know much about the bible ?"
5051,231,agent_2,"yes , do you like fopbtall ?"
5052,231,agent_1,"yes , i do . did you know that before 1963 , it qwas not uncommon for american students to be required to read from the bibke as part of their elementary education ?"
5053,231,agent_2,"yes , i did ! do you liek the patriots ? tom brady ?"
5054,231,agent_1,"don't know much about teh patriots or tom brady . did you kno wthat thoms jefferson created his own version of the bible , cutting out the 'supernatural' parts , such as the miracles and teh resurrection ?"
5055,231,agent_2,"yes , i wonder why he did that ? teddy roosevelt and john adams only two who did not use the bible for swearing inc eremonie s?"
5056,231,agent_1,jefferson wanted to see religion in humanist tersm . i think tr and ja swore on the constitution . they felt that they owed allegiance to the people and tge government first .
5057,231,agent_2,"intereting , i didn't know the word apple in latin is malus ?"
5058,231,agent_1,it that is an interesting coincidence .
5059,231,agent_2,did you know the nfl has no rules sagainsw6 women playing ?
5060,231,agent_1,that's great ! there should a team entirely of women !
5061,231,agent_2,"that would be interesting to watch ! with only 11 minutes of liv egame play on average , gives tiem to eat footall treats or standing i nline at teh stadium . lol"
5062,231,agent_1,i figure the best way to 2atch the game is to look at highlight s. did you know that the average lifetme earnings of an engkneer ar ehigher than the averae lifetime earnings of a nnf lpalyer ?
5063,231,agent_2,that is s7rprising . ameo ssense with the average player . do you watch the new orlean ssaints ?
5064,231,agent_1,"o , i dont' really watch their games . a4e they any goo d?"
5065,231,agent_2,"yes , thinking their cheerleaders might have a problem having tol eave the restaurant if a player comes in ."
5066,231,agent_1,tha'ts true . that sexist thinking is out of date .
5067,231,agent_2,"v4ry , having tracking chips in balls and shoulder pads is a great idea !"
5068,231,agent_1,i think if might hlep prevent injury .
5069,231,agent_2,"benjarvus greenellis is a great player , never to fumble the ball !"
5070,231,agent_1,he is ag reat player . he should get an award or a bous for tht !
5071,231,agent_2,"i agree , something to be recognized ! ! great chat ! !"
5072,231,agent_1,"great chat , cat !"
5073,231,agent_2,have a great day ! !
5074,232,agent_1,do you like footbal ?
5075,232,agent_2,i do . i like tom brady . do you ?
5076,232,agent_1,"i love tom brady , his the best player of the mfl histoy in my opinion"
5077,232,agent_2,he plays football like it is his religion . he even haa a book called ' athlete's bible . '
5078,232,agent_1,"i would like to eat that book , he says that par of his xuccess is due toe ating avocadp ice cream , sounds a bit djsgusting"
5079,232,agent_2,"that is gross ., he is very focused on the whys of life ."
5080,232,agent_1,"yeah well he must be doing something right , he is 0 and his atill on top of his gamw ,"
5081,232,agent_2,bady is a kind of messiah figure for patriots fans .
5082,232,agent_1,"i can see why , h ewaz lead them to various superbowls , i think that 4 or 5 of them or even more"
5083,232,agent_2,brady's commitment to the tb12 method is sihcere . he works hard .
5084,232,agent_1,"he does wokr hard , the success of the patiots isnt due to good luc k, so do you have a favorite team ?"
5085,232,agent_2,i'm married to a broncos fan . did you know the former patriots rb greenellis has neve rfumbled in his nfl career .
5086,232,agent_1,"i didnt , i love dto watch him play but didnt know he holded that record , he juxst nbe the only rb in thd history of the nfl"
5087,232,agent_2,i didn't realiz ethere were 32 teams .
5088,232,agent_1,"yeah 32 teams ,1 6 in eacb division ,"
5089,232,agent_2,mjakes sense . i read that the averafe game onlyh as 11 minutes of live gameply .
5090,232,agent_1,"only 11 minutes of game play ? that doesn't seem like a lot , i guess ads tske too much of the time"
5091,232,agent_2,also the aberage kifetim earnings of an ehgineer is higher than the average lifeime earnings of an nfl player
5092,232,agent_1,"thart seem sabout tight , engineers tend to work for a longer time , footbalp players have shorter carreers"
5093,232,agent_2,that is what i was thinkign and no cheerleaders are forbidden from eating i8n the same restraudsnt as any nfl player
5094,232,agent_1,that is an awerul rule but i guess there must be a good reason behind that .
5095,233,agent_1,"hi , do you watch the nfl ?"
5096,233,agent_2,hey yed very much so . do you have a favorite team ?

5122,234,agent_1,"i havetn seen it but i have heard about it , you ?"
5123,234,agent_2,"i haven't , i think a lot of people haven't seen it is because it's broadcasted o nfacebook watch , do you use rhat feature of facebook ?"
5124,234,agent_1,"i do not , ill catch some stuff there once in a while butn ot regularly . i heard his tb12 method is like a religion to some"
5125,234,agent_2,yeah people invst a lot of hope into thge team . they eve nhavew tgeir own creed called ' in bill we trust ' for their worship of the patriot's coahc .
5126,234,agent_1,"even though they describe him as a raggamuffin , thdy still love him . he doesnt have brady's chzrisma though"
5127,234,agent_2,"haha , what's a raggamuffin ? what did he dot o warran tthatn ickname ?"
5128,234,agent_1,its is sloppy looking fashion sense . kind of unkempt .
5129,234,agent_2,"oh ok , i didn't know that about him . maybe bil was hoping the camera's wouldn't focus on his fashion style since there's only eleven minutes of live gameplay ."
5130,234,agent_1,crazy that really is all that there is when games take 34 hiurs .
5131,234,agent_2,"yeah , i devote an rntire afternoon to watch th egame , if the games were longer than eleven minutes , i think i'd be a douch potato the whol cay ! don't think i mind that too muhc though ."
5132,234,agent_1,same here . id live on the couch if that were the case and get far less rone tha ni already do .
5133,234,agent_2,"with only eleve nminutes of gameplay , they still earn millions but somehow bowlerx back in the day made mjuch more than nfl players , hardd to believe htat still exists today ."
5134,234,agent_1,true . i wonder how much each was making in th e60's to make it even . was bowling ever that lopular .
5135,234,agent_2,"yeha , does professional still exist ? i'd i8magine sports companues wouldn't be able to endors ethem because i don't think they make any bowling clothes ."
5136,234,agent_1,"true , i can't name one professional bowler , past or present ."
5137,234,agent_2,"me neither , ifa n7thing , i definitely don?'t think they are broadcasted on sunday which is whne football gsmes are broadcasted and super bowl is held first snday in february ."

5143,235,agent_1,have tou read it ? i hear it is his metod of pursuing high performance .
5144,235,agent_2,no i haven't but some ;elple say it kind of cultist . he has some fasn that fall him the messiah
5145,235,agent_1,"probably hal fof boston . . . i think heh s ag ood head on his shouldersa nd his game play shows he is a serious prson , dedicated to performing at thew highest level possible . i would imagine his book is a legitimate exercise in sharin gwhat he beli3ves are keys to helping him stay in top for ."
5146,235,agent_2,yeah i agree he subscribes to avocado ice cream have you evre had it ?
5147,235,agent_1,"no , , but i'm interested ! i once read a quote ftrom brady which read , ' if you're going ot compete againstm e , you better be willig ot give up your life because i'm giving up mine ' you know , whatever you believe you were made 5o do , yo have to admire someone who is dedicated so m8ch o himself to do what he thinks is his mission ."
5148,235,agent_2,yeah that's is dedication . apparently his paln for his life is all part of the tb12 method .
5149,235,agent_1,that is living intentionally . it does see bizaar that someone might ded8cate himself to a game that only has an averge of 11 minutes of playing time each weke . htat's a lot of preparation for such a small amount oft ime .
5150,235,agent_2,well i'ms ure it a lit to do with hte pay . tom has made it his religion adcording to chopra .
5151,235,agent_1,"well , he is focused on his game and shows no sigh of quitting anytime soon . who knows , mayeb he will be the firstaq b to reach 7 nfl championships ?"

5157,235,agent_1,"if an average gam eis only 11 minutes , that eans the one team scored 20 points per minute ! good heavens !"
5158,235,agent_2,yeah that ridiculous . georgia tech and cumberland were the teams back in 1916 l

5163,236,agent_2,yeah i think this is his 5th ring . apparently he has some regiment cwlled tb12 method taht includes avovcado ice cream .
5164,236,agent_1,avocado ice cream sounds like simething someone would either love or hate . but omething has to be working becaus ehe is 40 and stilp going .
5165,236,agent_2,yeah i guess your right . did you know that once upon a time bnowler made twice as much a stp nfl players ?
5166,236,agent_1,"that is crazy ! i wonder what the pay was then ? i think it is kinda high now , especially when you look at the fact that thewre is only 11 minutes of game play during any given game ."
5167,236,agent_2,"rigth , i think all sports player are over paid . they njesed to use some of that money to pay for univsrsal health care in my oponin ."
5168,236,agent_1,i agree . though the earning of an engineer over their life timea re higher htat th eearnings of a football payer . that makes me feel a little better .
5169,236,agent_2,untik you think about retirement age . i'll 6ake ten and out with millions over forty plus and out with millions . lol . what about you ?
5170,236,agent_1,same here . i would rather a few years to make my millions .

5189,237,agent_1,"i didn' tknow he was 40 ! i definitely want to know his secrets . goes to show you money is not everything . he has it all yet he is still lookign for a meaning to life . successfull career , a beautiful top model wife , money , loads of t , kids a house , amterials ever4ything but still looking for a meaning . . . its beautiful tha twe can all relate evem if our lives are completely different . we are a; loen ."
5190,237,agent_2,"i know !h e is still playing at a tip top level ,a nd winning ."
5191,237,agent_1,it would be interesting to see his travcking numbers . since the nf lhas a chip embedded in the footballs and in the shoulder of the playerz to measure speed and distance .
5192,237,agent_2,"it would , and the ball to see exactly how fast he can fling it ."
5193,237,agent_1,yes ! and who knew that the average nfl game has only 12 minutes of live game play ! my father and lwaw and husband make it feel like eternal haha
5194,237,agent_2,that is because it is an eternity . i mean 4 hours for 11 minutes of play ? not the quickest game in the world .
5195,237,agent_1,"just lijke monopoly ! i culdn tdo it , im too impatient and not that strong for football . im afraid ill break sometjing these days . even though itw ouild be interesting to see a remale in the nfl , hopedully someday we see it , there are currently ho written ruel against femal eplayers"
5196,237,agent_2,as long as they are treate bette rthna the cheerleaders i think it could be a good thing . they dont treat cheerleaders too well .
5197,237,agent_1,"oh true ! thats what i heard ! especially in the new orelans saints ,k apparantly cheerleaders caf be in the sam restaurant as the players . if they are the6 must leave . . . thats terrible . i wlnder why"
5198,237,agent_2,i doht know what kind of ijcident cou8ld have prompted a rule like that . it is a little overboard in my opinion .
5199,237,agent_1,"your right , something must of happened ; time ssure have changed , for starter sback in th 1960's top bowlers made twice az much as top vfootball stars !"
5200,237,agent_2,"hat is crazy , i wondeeh ow good the pay was . i mean if bowlers were gettinf the same pay it couldnt have been great . nothing like what engineers made at the time ."
5201,237,agent_1,you are right 2 i couldn't believe it . the average enineers is higher tham the average lifetime earnings of an nfl plqayer and mlb . socce ris the highest paid however .
5202,238,agent_1,"h9 , how are you ? do you know much about teh bible ?"
5203,238,agent_2,"hello , i'm doing well ! i know a little bit k i thjnk it's interesting how religious books are similar , like the old testamnet overlaps wihrt the hberew bible ajd the greek septuagint ."
5204,238,agent_1,"they are all in the abrahamic traxdition . the ideax date back very far . did you know that before 1963 , it was not uncommon for americqn students to be required to read from the bible a spar tof hteir elementary educatiln ?"
5205,238,agent_2,"i did not know that q but thinking about it ,l it makes sense . w really have it ingrained so much in soviety . i think teddy roosevelt is one of the only presidentsw ho didn't swear in on th ebible"
5206,238,agent_1,the ither is john quincy adams . they swore on the consyitution because tehy felt that they owed allegiance to the people and the government first .
5207,238,agent_2,"ahh ok , that's interesting . it's good for people in power to have choice like that . thomas jefferson had his own version of the bible , after he cut out parts using a razor ."
5208,238,agent_1,he was a practical gjy and wanted to see religion in humanist terms .
5209,238,agent_2,"it's interestjng bow the bible draws from real life ss wrll . i was shockedt o find out tge tower f babel waas likely based off of the real lifeb uilding , the etemenanki ."
5210,238,agent_1,"the bible has a lot of conenctions to 5e rela wolrd . linguistically too . an apple only became known as an ' apple ' when the bible was translated into latin in the 4th cejtury . the reason : the word ' mauls ' means both apple and evi, ."
5211,238,agent_2,"that's interesting ! i fhink it's surprising the disagreements people have over the bible , i always thought of it as straight forward ! but i guess some people disqgree what parts of i tshould be included in the canon ."
5212,238,agent_1,"i hink there are politicalp mltivatiohns bheind that , ,ike in the case of jefferson . leaders want certain beliefs to be followed ."
5213,238,agent_2,"i think that's fair . regardless it's cleqr many , mnay people have considered it interesting enough to buy . it's technically the bestsllinhg book of all time with 5 billion copies ."
5214,238,agent_1,they might hot know the conytroversy behind what got chosen fo go into the book . so much has beeh left out .
5215,238,agent_2,"yeah that's very true . speaking of controversy , did you know in the nf , if cheerleaders are eating in a restaurant and players come in afte r, teh cheerleaders still have to leave ? htat's terrible ."
5216,238,agent_1,the women in the nfl get treated lke secondc lass citizens . it's sahmeful .
5217,238,agent_2,"definitely , but at the same time that maes it even more sudprising female players are technically allowwed !"
5218,238,agent_1,they would be better off as engineers in the long run . no concusions !
5219,238,agent_2,"tha'ts true , andm oe than that , don't engineers make more ? i think on average they have yhigher lifetime earnings than fl players , and even mlb players also !"
5220,238,agent_1,"i'm not surprised . nfl players have short careers , due to injury and age . anyway , i enjoyed hcatting with you q"
5221,238,agent_2,"definitely , but it's also surprising considerimng there's only 11 minutes of actual live play every game ."
5222,238,agent_1,true . only 11 minutes stretched over hours . not what you'd think .
5223,238,agent_2,but definitely nice chatting with you as well l have a good night !
5224,239,agent_1,hello . do you lik4 avocado ice cteam ? tlm brwdy does .
5225,239,agent_2,its what us keeping him on the top of his gam
5226,239,agent_1,"i think i would have to pass , as it sounds disgusting . i didn't realize he and depak chopra's son were friends . also weird that depak would name his son gotham ."
5227,239,agent_2,yes he did . i would lobe to read his book ' athlete's bible '
5228,239,agent_1,"i'm not readign anything from an nfl player , until they demand that hte saints stop that insane rule that their cheerleaders have to leave ar estaurant if a player comes in ."
5229,239,agent_2,tha tis so wrong . that makes me mad just thinkinga bout it . at least women can play in the fnl
5230,239,agent_1,"as long as they meet the eligibility requirements , and i'k sure many do ."
5231,239,agent_2,i did not know the espn created the superimposed yellow line representing the first down line
5232,239,agent_1,"they won an emmy for it . that must have been an awful year , if that is what won ."
5233,239,agent_2,and if i were cumbelrand
5234,239,agent_1,what is cumberland ?
5235,239,agent_2,im sorry i hit enter before finishing . i was sayng that if i were cumberpand i would have quit playing that game after the 1st 100 points
5236,239,agent_1,oh . the georgia tech gma e! why didj't the coache sstop that ? they do in high scuool games .
5237,239,agent_2,i would have wanted to be a bowler instead of a player in the 60's
5238,239,agent_1,even engineers make more money thzn a player . i don?t think i could have watched pro bowling though .
5239,239,agent_2,i never knew that greenellis has never fumbled theb al; . i wonder if he is the only one
5240,239,agent_1,"probably , s those tracking chips in the balls register everything ."
5241,239,agent_2,sl thomas jefferson did not believe in miracles and the resurrection .
5242,239,agent_1,a lot of people do't . maybe bradys houldb e give na copy of his bible .
5243,239,agent_2,yes because the bible is the best selling boo0k ever .

5263,240,agent_2,its very shocking . but we want to identify our mistakes and correct them and move to the enxt game .
5264,240,agent_1,"dn't you think , it would be better just to forget to the game , because a loss of 222 points there nothing to learn fro mit ."
5265,240,agent_2,what we want to do ?
5266,240,agent_1,"i would go to bar and just forget the game , and think about the next gaem as if the 0222 loss never happened ."
5267,240,agent_2,"just relax ,t he team wa simproved and work hard to improve the game ."
5268,240,agent_1,"maybe they have read the binle to get peace . it was until 1963 that us student were required to read tfhr bible in ac lassroom , that is quite shocking ."

5329,243,agent_2,"ges i agree , i htink wbw is great and maybe women should get a lal women pro team called wnfl and see how that work out for them ."

5331,243,agent_2,"yes , is that used to keep track of nfl players , i wonder why , this should bel ike invading thei private lives , that'sj st my opinion ."
5332,243,agent_1,it is only used in th efield to track their velocity ad rotation and such . hopefully they can use that to make the game safer too
5333,243,agent_2,"yes , you are right , this is good for their safety , do you agree that the average nfl gmaes last 11 minutes ?"
5334,243,agent_1,it seems that thjey are pretty short yeah but we have to be glued to the fv for hours until that ends
5335,243,agent_2,"but don' tyou think that's a little too short to be divide dintk 4 quarter , auarterback plays , runnimg back play s, kicks filed goals tha'ts too much for 11 minutes ."
5336,243,agent_1,i think the1 1 minutes take into accouny only the time tey are running arounda nd not when they get into positon and such . not sure but it hink that us that it is
5337,243,agent_2,"it got to be something ljike that , mayb , it average take me eleven minutes just eat , hahahaha ."
5338,243,agent_1,"on another topic , do you know much about tuhe bibel ?"
5339,244,agent_1,"are you a nnfl fan ? back in the 60s , pro bowlers actually made more money than pro fotball players ! crazy huh ?"
5340,244,agent_2,that is crazy . i think tjey all are paid pretty eell today .
5341,244,agent_1,"yeah , especialluy qb's like brady . he has a book out entitled ' the athlete's bible ' ."
5342,244,agent_2,in my opinion religio nan dsports dont mix . its just a way for him to make some more money .
5343,244,agent_1,"i'm not sur eit's all about religion . i think it's more about mental preparation and evne one's physical health , e . g . , nutrition , ;."
5344,244,agent_2,"well that make sa littl ebit more sense , i still think oits all about the money he will get from it though ."
5345,244,agent_1,"his , ife as a mofel , actually make smore than him . i also not so sure he's doing it for money . he mayb e . there are really religious people on his team like matt slater . hye?s an evangelist off the field ."
5346,244,agent_2,its nice to know some of those guys are still good maral characters . with all the off the field trouble you hear about of athletes .
5347,244,agent_1,true . sme od the fana tret thej lik4 deities . theys ay ' in bilp we trust ' about the coach and some see brady as a messiah .
5348,244,agent_2,in m opinion there is only one nesiah . h ecertainly isnt a football player . dont get me wrong i love football . i just dont go that deep with it .
5349,244,agent_1,"no one should . it's a game . btw , a short game . they say there is only 11 minutes iof actual gameplay in an nfl game . i find that hard tob elieve ."
5350,244,agent_2,"i believe it . most of the bame is getting ready fort h enext play , anr then most plays last like 7s econds ."
5351,244,agent_1,"i played in hs and there was a lot of standing around . speaking of the pats , fprmer rb greenellis never fumbled the ball in his nfl career . good hands !"
5352,244,agent_2,yeah thats pretty awmazing considering how physical the game is .
5353,244,agent_1,i'm also amazed that the u . of iowa has a pibk locker room for visitors .
5354,244,agent_2,yeah that seems like they are going to some pretty good lengths to get into the head of the opponents .
5355,244,agent_1,"yeah , that's what brady's book i supposedt o be about . i just learned that teddy roosevelt znd jon q . adams are the only presidents that didn't use a bible to get sworn in . i wonde rwhat they used ?"
5356,244,agent_2,i dont think they used anything . i wonder if they were athists or why they didnt swear in on the bible .
5357,244,agent_1,i can't see that but maybe . isn't it wild that they think they gound the actual tower of babel in iraq ?
5358,244,agent_2,that is wild .
5359,244,agent_1,"in the end , everyone does their own thing . jefferson cut out ' supernatural ' , e . g . , miracles , in his own bible ."
5360,244,agent_2,oh yeah . to each his own i gues s. i like my bible the way it was written .g ood chat
5361,245,agent_1,hey are you a football fan ?
5362,245,agent_2,"yeah , he's smar t, i beleve his methodt hat involves lots of avocado ice cream to ehplp him stay at the top of his game is brilliant !"
5363,245,agent_1,"yeah if you like avocado ice cream , lo l! i think he calls it the tb12 method ."
5364,245,agent_2,"yeah ,t om brady , that is . he is surprisinglt spiritual ."
5365,245,agent_1,i did not know taht about him . he's got like 5 rings now riht ?
5366,245,agent_2,"i believe so . it's crazy to think , on average footnall games have 11 minutes of actual playing , yet there is so much excitement with watchign them ."
5367,245,agent_1,right ! hey i guess the iowa ciach thought paintingt he visiting lockwr room pink was a good strategy .
5368,245,agent_2,many strange thins ahve happened . decades ago bowelrs made more than foobtall players .
5369,245,agent_1,yeah ih ear twice as much and that georgia tech cumberland game was played in 1916 .
5370,245,agent_2,it is a game i grew up loving to watch .
5371,245,agent_1,that's great . did you know that espn wona nh award .
5372,245,agent_2,yes ! it is so interesting tol earn the history behind thingss uch as teh symbols representing first down lines in american football games .
5373,245,agent_1,i haven't heard aboutt hode . i do know theya re going t add trackihng chips in the padding of the players .
5374,245,agent_2,"yeah , that is a good ideat o maek oversight of the game and makug calls more accurate ."
5375,245,agent_1,"pretty soon will be watching drones , ll ! you know the nfl onky produced one left handed quarterbacks ?"
5376,245,agent_2,"yeah , qn dfurthesrmore , aybe we'll see women in hte nfl , since there is no written rule forbidding them from joining ."
5377,245,agent_1,if so make a all women's team like the wnba
5378,245,agent_2,"yeah , if women do enter thde nfl , i'm sure isues of fairness between players will arise ."
5379,245,agent_1,riyht it will change the game forever . apparently the lifetime earnings of a nfl players deoesn't compare to that of a nengineer .
5380,245,agent_2,"with that in mind , maybe beinv an engineer would be a better idea ."
5381,245,agent_1,well only for the long run . give me a pofessionla 10 year career a sa player and then retirement any day .
5382,245,agent_2,true . well it was nice tlaking !
5383,245,agent_1,you too ! don't forget to try the avocado ice cream
5384,246,agent_1,"hello , are you particularly a fan of football ?"
5385,246,agent_2,i love football bug i don't gret to watch much anymor e. i hear tom b wrote a boo k.
5386,246,agent_1,"he did , ' the tb22 method ' right ? i think it was interesting , one of the things i learnt is his love for ' avocado ice cream ' , would never have guessed that as his secret ."
5387,246,agent_2,"i qould ahve never guessed avocado's could eb maee into an ice cream , lol . apparently football has become his religoon , though ."
5388,246,agent_1,"and i didn'tg et that at firdt but i think it makes sense , he's so dwedicated to it . i read something by spiritual writer deepak chopra explaining the similarities between sports and religion ."
5389,246,agent_2,ok is that his deepak' sson gotham chopra ? he said tom want something bigger thn football .
5390,246,agent_1,"i don't think so hah a, think it's just the same last name . but i think this chopra is the one producing them ovie ' tom vs . time ' , brady certainly ha sbeaten father tim eso far ."
5391,246,agent_2,ye4ah 40 and winning the super bowl is no small achievement . appa4ently the fans have a freed in bill we tust ' !
5392,246,agent_1,"ahah it makes sense , patriots fans are degvoed . although it's nothing compared to trhe love for grady , fans love belichick but brady is basically the messiah ."
5393,246,agent_2,"what ! well i guess that's what you call hell bound fans , lol ! so what is this like his 5th or 6ths uper bowl ring . i hear even now he's slaed to win te next super bowl ."
5394,246,agent_1,"i thimk so goo ! although some people are worried about what's going to happnbe to him after nis career . bob ryan said something about the book being creepy , liek fvootball is going to tak eover his ;life even after h3e retires ."
5395,246,agent_2,yeah wha the szid was that it ound cultist . htat's nothing i want to dabble in . i think he's a great player .
5396,246,agent_1,"oh definitely , plus it's not surprising how much he's revered , maybe it's a new england thing . have you heard of benjarvus greenellis ?"
5397,246,agent_2,yeah he's z fomrer patriot player right ?
5398,246,agent_1,"he is ! and one thing he got recognition for was never fumbling the ball throughout his caree r, i wonder if he ever got an award for it ."
5399,246,agent_2,if not he should hace . did you know that the iowa state visiting locker room is painted pink . i winde4 why ?
5400,246,agent_1,"i'm guessing it's too intimidate visirors ? although by this point i doubt people are still surprised by it , so i don't think it's effective ."
5401,246,agent_2,yeah i'm sure your righr . can you velieve top bowlers made more thna top nfl players in the 60's ?
5402,246,agent_1,"did they really ? that's shocking , i wonder why , maybe people din't care about foothall as much back then . also i'm sure bowling games have more than 11 minutes of game play ."
5403,246,agent_2,htat's unbelievable . almost as much as espn winning an emmy . do you know what for ?
5404,246,agent_1,"i think it waw for creating the first down line ! i guess it shows more people care about footbal lnow . anyways 9t was nice talking 5to yu , have a good day !"
5405,247,agent_1,hi ware you a football fan ?
5406,247,agent_2,"yep , how bout you"
5407,247,agent_1,yeah i don't get to watchb it much anymore though . i hear bowlers uaed to make more than top nfl players in the 60's
5408,247,agent_2,tnats amaz8ng to learn . i think thazt has changed just a lityle .
5409,247,agent_1,yeah as for tom brady he swears by avocado ice crema .
5410,247,agent_2,i think i read that somewhete . in ever actually tried it though . is it good .
5411,247,agent_1,"i can't imagine . . . but i guess if you add enough sugar ro it , haah ! he cakls it tb12 method ."
5412,247,agent_2,lol . to each his oan i guess . maybe i will try it out .
5413,247,agent_1,i do lie avocados . it's amazing to thin kthat those bowlers made twice as much as top perforemrs .
5414,247,agent_2,yeah i have never beeb muvh of a bowler . my uncle bowled a perfect game though . he ia prety good .
5415,247,agent_1,wow that's awesome . i got a turkey once . tuhe patriot produced a rb htat never fumbled the bhall in his entire career .
5416,247,agent_2,yeah his name was benjarvisg reene llis
5417,247,agent_1,yeah that's right . that's quite a accomplishment . kind of like 5the college game that scored 2200
5418,247,agent_2,"yeah that is a lot of scoring . i think i wold have called benjarvis , double double . cause dide has two first names andt wo last name . lol ."
5419,247,agent_1,"i know make a choice laready . georgia tech wasn ot playing around with cumberland , i would not have wanted to be on that bus ride home ."
5420,247,agent_2,me either . bet they avoided playing them fora while .
5421,247,agent_1,did you hear about the emmy that espn won ?
5422,247,agent_2,yeah for th3 yellow first down line . genius in my opinion .
5423,247,agent_1,mine too mqde it a lot easier . you know th3res no written rule that keeps women from playing in the nfl ?
5424,247,agent_2,i think it'a more the status quo of hte sport that keeps them out . maybe they could be kicker or pumter .
5425,247,agent_1,yeah i don't discriminate but u do think it's just habit to think of football as a malexonly sport
5426,247,agent_2,i totally agree with you there . well im gonna have to get off here good chat . tty l.
5427,248,agent_1,"how's it going , are you a footabll fan ; tom brady recemntly releasef his best sel.ling tb12 m3thod"
5428,248,agent_2,"i don't really knowm uch aout football , or tom brady . what is this book of his ?"
5429,248,agent_1,it's a book that details brady's dieta nd training regimen twhih he credits with being able to still play football at 40
5430,248,agent_2,that sounds like an impressive achievement ! is it a populasr book ? is it for people like me ad you ?
5431,248,agent_1,"it's popular with a lot of people , i guess a lot of people view it ad a mix of sports and eligion"
5432,248,agent_2,"i guess tom has followers then , like a reigious leader ."
5433,248,agent_1,yea i guess boston fans see the pa6riots as a religion and tom brady as an apos6le of the team
5434,248,agent_2,then the team myust have other apostles ? or other religious figures ?
5435,248,agent_1,they do have a sloga n' in bill wet rust ' that refers to teh patriots' coach
5436,248,agent_2,i guess it sounds like a religion . or a cult . the book must be a best seller . people follow teh guidance in th ebook ? make it part of their lives ?
5437,248,agent_1,well tom brady does and a lot of his teammates l i guess most non athletes who read it are just fans
5438,248,agent_2,how many copies has it sold ? it can't nearly so many as the bible .
5439,248,agent_1,i'm not sure but some people think brady is only motivated by moeny
5440,248,agent_2,he probably has a lot of money as a football star . i wonder how much he can make from a biok .
5441,248,agent_1,hmm i don'tk now . i guess he could always try another sport aftfer football . the top bowlers in the 1960s mad emor ethat the top footbalk stars
5442,248,agent_2,"that was 0robably the golden age of bowling . manyl eagues formed , and people tried the sport . probahly not ever going to be as popular again ."
5443,248,agent_1,"well brady could become an engineer , hte azverage dngineer makes more than af ootball player in their lifetime"
5444,248,agent_2,thats ounds like a plan . the world can always ude more engineers .
5445,248,agent_1,yea football players do make a lot of money for only 11 mins of actual gameplay
5446,248,agent_2,they do get paid for standinga round a lot . i guess they feel that they have worked hard to get there .
5447,248,agent_1,"well i hot tog o , nice talking with you"
5448,249,agent_1,do you like football ?
5449,249,agent_2,"can't say i'm a fan , i could tell you some basic well know facts , but not m8ch else ."
5450,249,agent_1,"same , i also only have a oassing knpwledge in football ."
5451,249,agent_2,"tom brady i've heard of , very accomplished and successful . i guesw he's branching out from football ."
5452,249,agent_1,well h eis considered among th ebest quarterbakcs in history
5453,249,agent_2,maybe it will be worth my time buying his new book and watching his show then .
5454,249,agent_1,what is his new book ?
5455,249,agent_2,"the tb12 method . some kidn of athletes bible , tells you how tk beh ealthy , physically and spi4itually ."
5456,249,agent_1,by spiritually does he mean the mental component ?
5457,249,agent_2,"no , he's starting to conflpate sport with treligion , i dont really get it myself . probably just a gimmi8ck to sell some books ."
5458,249,agent_1,"in any vase , k think he is quite the ex0ert in regaeds to healtha dn the physica body given his achievements"
5459,249,agent_2,you can't denyt his achievements . often these books are not evne written by the person they ate supposed to be done by . a hgost writers does the work and a famous person adds tehir naem to the cover .
5460,249,agent_1,"i can see how that could be true , but without proof , i don't want to diminish a persons efforts"
5461,249,agent_2,"it's kind of na open secret , there's alway sa clue in hte legal paged at the front . will you be watching his documentary tim vs time ?"
5462,249,agent_1,probably not . will you ?
5463,249,agent_2,"i barely watch t anymore , the kids usually have access to it . most of my evening isa lso taken up dricing kids to their various sporting adtivities , not football though ."
5464,249,agent_1,well perhaps you can find a shor5 version tha tonly show sthe live gameplay . each gme is only a dozen or so minutes lonb of rweal gameplay
5465,249,agent_2,"that's another treason why i don't watch footbal. , rthree hours in front of the television for just 12 m8nutes of actual action . i could just grab my bible instead ."
5466,249,agent_1,do ou read from the bible often ?
5467,249,agent_2,not really . i'm some times curious ehen i hear people quo6te from it . i used to have to do it in school when i was a kid .
5468,249,agent_1,"i agree . in any case , htanks for chatting ."
5469,250,agent_1,hi how are you today ?
5470,250,agent_2,i am goof how about you ?
5471,250,agent_1,i am good . do you like football ?
5472,250,agent_2,yes . packers fan
5473,250,agent_1,"i ,ike football but not enough to think that tom brady wrote the athlete bible ya know ."
5474,250,agent_2,i am not a patriots fan or a fan of brady
5475,250,agent_1,i don't understand why the nfl has been using tracking chip xsi the players shoulder padws .
5476,250,agent_2,they trac keverything today by tech lkoking for an edge
5477,250,agent_1,"yeah , it definitley seems that way"
5478,250,agent_2,they evenh ave them in footablls now
5479,250,agent_1,"that is crazy . like , everyghing in the worldd oesn't need tracking , at least in my opiniob ."
5480,250,agent_2,6yes its getting nuts . tracking velocity and even rotation
5481,250,agent_1,7ep
5482,250,agent_2,they arw even using a lot of tech in hbaseball these days
5483,250,agent_1,the cell industry is defknitely taking over the wolrsd .
5484,250,agent_2,i toftally agrer with you on that
5485,250,agent_1,are you religious ?
5486,250,agent_2,yes . fairly so
5487,250,agent_1,did you know that thomas jefferson had created his own version of the bible so he could remove the supernatural parts . thats wild .
5488,250,agent_2,no . i didnt . that is wild
5489,250,agent_1,"yes , definitrly ,a nd also the biblicsl tower of baebl is based on a real building in present day iraq ."
5490,250,agent_2,yes . i had read that before
5491,250,agent_1,its ben nice talking to u
5492,251,agent_1,"tom rbady is a great player and a football legned , do you agree ?"
5493,251,agent_2,i agree loved his tm vs tom documentary . have you seen it ?
5494,251,agent_1,"i did , i aslo loved it l football has become like a r3ligionh to brady , i have to agree on that"
5495,251,agent_2,yes . did you read his book ' the tb12 method ' ?
5496,251,agent_1,"no , i didnt read that one , did 6ou rea it ?"
5497,251,agent_2,i haven't read it . he credits it though withh elpign him to stay at the top of his gam3 .
5498,251,agent_1,"i might pick that book up sounds interesting , maybe i can learn a thing or two from it , he must have a lot of healthy habits , success like that isnt achieved without discipline"
5499,251,agent_2,true . did you know that the university of iowa's visiting plsyers locker roo mis painted pink ? i wonder why they did that ?
5500,251,agent_1,"sounds really funny lkol , i wonder why they did that as ell ahd i also wondser the faces of the visitig players , it must be confusing"
5501,251,agent_2,lil right ? in the 1960's it paid more to be a owler than an nfl player . bowler's made twice as muc has the top football stars from back then .
5502,251,agent_1,"oh i see , thats odd considering how much money football players make"
5503,251,agent_2,yes . anotehr sueprising money fact is that the lifetime earnings of an engineer are higher than teh lifetime earnings of an nfl or mlb player .
5504,251,agent_1,"engineers also make a lot of money , they work for more years so it does mka esense"
5505,251,agent_2,i agree .t he highest scoring football game eve rwa swhen georgia tech beat cumberland 2220 in 1916 !
5506,251,agent_1,"that must have been a boring game , 222 points of difference ! ! ! i bet the other team was playing a totally different sport"
5507,251,agent_2,lol yes ! former rb benajrvus greenellis never fumbled the ball once durign his career . that's amazing .
5508,251,agent_1,"that is amazing , i bet he is one of the few players with that impressive record"
5509,251,agent_2,probably . i would imagine . do you ever read the bible ?
5510,251,agent_1,"no not really , i dont beleve in god , but i guess mnay people enjoy reading ijt , do you read it ?"
5511,251,agent_2,mnot really . i find it interesting that i'ts the highest selling book of all time with over 5 billion copies sold !
5512,251,agent_1,"theres a lot of religious people qdound the world and ts also one of the oldesxt books ,"
5513,252,agent_1,hi ! are you familiar with tom brady ? i'm verg interested in folloewing his tb12 method aka the athlete's bible !
5514,252,agent_2,hey ! i'm good . how is your day ? not relaly . what is it about ?
5515,252,agent_1,"to tom brady ,f ootball is basically a religion znd at age 40 , he likes to credit that lifestyle brand with beign in such great sha;pe . it's worth checking out ! are you a football fan at all ?"
5516,252,agent_2,"i wsatch football , not a loyt act8ally . i like hockey . i'llc heck it out for sure . i know him , but not really familiar with tb12 method you mentied . have you already tried or just planning to follow ?"
5517,252,agent_1,"i plan to follow one day . not just for health but to get em through the nfl offseason since the regular season only lasts 17 weeks , which js fr too short for 8s die hard ans . ha 21"
5518,252,agent_2,"honeslty i've nver been able to uhderstand why tis i sjust 17 weeks . if it was regular and at least 67 months , i'll probably follow more regularly lol are you fan of any team ?"
5519,252,agent_1,"i like the legue in general . i like the saints but i don't like that silly , misogynistic rule they have in place 5hat forbids cheerleaders and players from 4ating in the same restaurant . i'm surprised n lawsuits have been filed ovr that one yet !"
5520,252,agent_2,di dyou know that an averae nfl game only has 11 minutes ofl ive gameplay . it sounds so surprising and difficult to believe ! ! !
5521,252,agent_1,"i know , right ? commercials drag it out to make it seem lonver , i suppsoe . with that and knowing there ar no rules against qwomen playing , i'm surprised we haven't hada t least a female kicker drafted yet ! espescially in this day and agre !"
5522,252,agent_2,i'm wondering about female players . what kind of eligibility requirements do they have ? any idea ? because still we don't see any female players .
5523,252,agent_1,"ih onestly don't know but perhaps we'll see one someday soon ! although if a female running back ise ver drafted , she'll have a difficult time if she wanted to compete with benjarvus greenellis who's never fumbled the foobtall ih his entire pro caree r!"
5524,252,agent_2,"true ! i also read that the average lifstime earnings of an egninner is higher than an nfl player . it's actually ok , but i was sure they make a lot of money ."
5525,252,agent_1,ydah that surprises me ! the people who creates the tracking chips for shoudler pads and football's make more than the actual players themselves ! azh !
5526,252,agent_2,"i'm sre you are right . this industry has a lot of cash . it looks like players aren't people , eho take majr part fo rtrhat . bad fir them ! ! !"
5527,252,agent_1,"agred . heck , een in the 1960s , the top bowlers made twce as much thant he top footabll players . that is jus downrigyht sad ."
5528,252,agent_2,"really ? ha . . . that's interesting . wha have changed draamtically aftert hat ? nfl has some stranger ules . for example , new orleans cheerleaders are forbidden from eating 9n the same restauratns as any fnl players . it looks likes tu;id rule . any idea why ? i don't see any meaning"
5529,252,agent_1,i know and it sounds like discrimination to be completely honest . what i also think is silly is georgia tech actually beat a team 2020 once back in 1916 . it's the highet scorre evet in a football game . that juzst sounds humiliating .
5530,252,agent_2,i cannot imagin ethis score nad how game was . absolutely no . i'm sure players of lost tea mremembered t for long time . . .
5531,252,agent_1,"perhaps if georgia tech's locker room was pink like tge locker room at the university of iowa , maybe the score would have been divferent . haha then again it probqbly would have angered them even more ."
5532,252,agent_2,good joke ! i also read about pink color of dressing room . what do they expect should happen ? do they believe it my dchange how vompetitors play ? lol
5533,252,agent_1,"haz ! to me k it seems like it would further amnger a team hwich is the last thing i'd wanna do ! well it was great chatting wit hy0ou ! i'm onna go eat an apple . speak9ing of which , the fruit itsslf only became known as na apple after the bible was translated into latin . malus actually means both evil nad apple . ha ! have a great day !"
5534,253,agent_1,"hokwdy , how's it going ?"
5535,253,agent_2,"its going great , how bout yourself"
5536,253,agent_1,i am fine . do you read the book the bible ?
5537,253,agent_2,i have read parts of it . i dont read it very of6en and i have never read it wokrd for wor d.
5538,253,agent_1,i think that it is a very poular book . many people have read it and tried to understand its secrets .
5539,253,agent_2,i dont kow . i dont alwayas take 8t really literally . i mainly use it as a good set of rules to live by to be a good person .
5540,253,agent_1,that is a good guide . there are many lessons buried deep within the scriptures that are hard to fathom . i is a good guide to look to one's conscience .
5541,253,agent_2,yeah htats so true . did you know yhat the bivle as sodl over 5 billion copies . i woder who has the copyrithg on it ?.
5542,253,agent_1,i don't know . i uess the money must go to soeone wqho uses it to helpt eh church .
5543,253,agent_2,yeah that was kind f a jole . maybe it was in te wrong timd . lol . sorry .
5544,253,agent_1,"i understand . the copyright onm th ebible is of course eld by a higher power , one no tbehuolden to man's laws . it was a funny joke . i did not see , but now i do . thsnk you ."
5545,253,agent_2,"so i wonder if the companies who printa n dsell the bibl,e , feel thje saje about that o rif they make s8re they make a profit off of i t."
5546,253,agent_1,they cannot profit qnd remain pure in the eyes of the one who wrote it . tehy would do well to consider the content sof the very book that they print .
5547,253,agent_2,yeah . i think you have a little jmore faith in humanity than i do .
5548,253,agent_1,"possibly . the bible has been used by many people for nany things , not all kf themk good . the book is not the laiety ."
5549,253,agent_2,that is true . many people have been persecuted in the name of god and the bibel .
5550,253,agent_1,"the bible is bu tone book ofm any . truth can be unearthed outside of books . the world holds many secrets , but you probably have the most inside of 7ou ."
5551,253,agent_2,"well aid . i just try to be a good person veryday . i believ ein god . i even blieve in the bibel . i just know that it has be rewritten o many times tha5 who knos xactly whqat was said in the original . i think the overall messge i swhat is important , and i dont think tgat has changed ."
5552,253,agent_1,"the originao i not the truest , nor is the newest the truest . you will know the truest from your own understanding of truth . have a good evenign , and may you rstudies take you forward ."
5553,253,agent_2,thank you . thi shas been a greatc onversation . hope you have a good one as well .
5554,253,agent_1,thank you .
5555,253,agent_2,bye
5556,254,agent_1,hey ! do you enjou flootball
5557,254,agent_2,"i do , i think its a greats port and i am a big fan , do you like it ?"
5558,254,agent_1,"yeah i do , i love watching the playoffs ."
5559,254,agent_2,"me too k, do you have a favorite team ?"
5560,254,agent_1,"i like the patriots , what about you ?"
5561,254,agent_2,"i like the patriots too , i lie in new envlanda nd i also .ike winnin teasm lol ."
5562,254,agent_1,"that is cool . brady said his book ' athletes bible ' has really helped hi, stay at hte top of his game at age 40 ."
5563,254,agent_2,"i hear he loves avocado icecream , not sure if i like it , theres a lot of flavors better fhan that one"
5564,254,agent_1,ew ! i don't evenl ike avocados .
5565,254,agent_2,"i know right , 9cecrea mplus avocado doesnt seem like a gery god combination , but it xoes the trick for braxy so tjank god for avocado icecream lol"
5566,254,agent_1,haha yeah ! a former patriot running back benjarvus greenellis has neve ronce fumled the foofbal in his career !
5567,254,agent_2,"thats crazy , the level okf skill that guy had , not fumbling a ball and being a rb , thats a hard thing to accomplisb"
5568,254,agent_1,definitely . thel ocker room in the university of iowa is painted pink for visiting football teams .
5569,254,agent_2,"tahts really funny , i bet thats how you win 2220 intimidwating the other team"
5570,254,agent_1,i guss it would work . can you beliece top bowlers made twice as much as football layers in 1960 ?t hat is insane ! you never hear about professional bowling anymore .
5571,254,agent_2,its not as popular as it used to be or maybe its because football is a lot more populr than back then
5572,254,agent_1,"yea hprobably . at least the technology has come a long way , the nfl uses tracking chips in the footballs and teh player's shoulder pads ."
5573,254,agent_2,"i heard about that , must be pretty expensive thre are 32 teams and a lot of players psr rooster ."
5574,254,agent_1,nlot inclucing all the balls they probably go through . i can't believe an average game is only 11 minutes !
5575,254,agent_2,"that seems like an unreap stat , a game lastsf or 2 to 3 hours each quarter 15 minute swithout qds ,"
5576,254,agent_1,"pparetnly it's claculated on live gameplay , who know ? haha . jt was great6 tal,king to youb ut i have to get diunner now . bye !"
5577,255,agent_1,"hello , are you particulaely interested in footabll ?"
5578,255,agent_2,sure ! it hink it's interesting that the nfl has no rule against female players .
5579,255,agent_1,"yeah i do too ! esp3fially because they seem sexist , the way cheerleaders have to leave if footbalol players were there first ."
5580,255,agent_2,the nfl uses tracking chips in playrss houlder pads to record a ;laye'rs moves on the field . maybs tuey could track players off the field and asvoid these situations .
5581,255,agent_1,"that's a good poing ! they definitely could come up with some technological innovation , like the first down lin e, that was asbolutely innovative ."
5582,255,agent_2,engineers csame up with that ! provably a better profession for women to choose . the average life6ime earnings of an engineer are higher than teh average lifetime earnings of an nf; player .
5583,255,agent_1,i wonder why that is ! maybe because engineers have to work l9nger ? after all foitball games oly have aboug 11 minutes of live game play .
5584,255,agent_2,"true , but there is litlte risk of concussion as an enguneer ."
5585,255,agent_1,that's true . maybe another reason could be teh country hasn't alway sneeded or loved football . i think in the 69s the top bowlers mazdw more than top footbal lplayers .
5586,255,agent_2,"bowlers were lucky . it was a goldden ag of the sport , never to retujrn again ."
5587,255,agent_1,"yeah i agree , plus i think football records are objectively more interestimg . like have you ever heard o fbenjarvus greneellis ?"
5588,255,agent_2,i think he's the guy who never fumbled a football . quite a feat ! he should yet a bonus or a priz efor that .
5589,255,agent_1,"exctly ! i think eh shoulfd get soemthinb . after alle spn golt an award for creating the fgirst down line , ancd i think that's similar in terms of impressivsness ."
5590,255,agent_2,do you know much about the bible ?
5591,255,agent_1,"i don't know too much ! i think a lot of religious texts are similar , like the old testaemnt overlaps with the hebrew bilbe and 6he greek sep6uagint ."
5592,255,agent_2,"very true . did you know that ebfor e1963 , it was not uncommon for americans tudents to be required to read from the bible as part of tehir elementary educatioh ?"
5593,255,agent_1,"i did not ! but it makes sense , we've really made it such a huge part of smerican culture . i think teddy roosevelt is one of the only presidents not tos wear in using the bible ."
5594,255,agent_2,same with jq adams . i think they swore o nthe constitution . they felt that htey owed allegiance to the peopl eand the government first .
5595,255,agent_1,"ahh that's a nice way to see it . on the other hand thomas jefferson found middle ground , i think he used a razor to cut out parts of hte buble to use his own version ."
5596,255,agent_2,he wanted to see religio nin humanist terms . he was a practical guy .
5597,255,agent_1,"ahh that makess ense . well it was nice talking to you , have a good day !"
5598,256,agent_1,hey do you like the nfl ? crazy that they have 32 different teams
5599,256,agent_2,i do enjoy thje nfl . i'm a bears fan myself .

5602,256,agent_1,"ya its ao labout his tips for success in lifw , it sa best selling ' atheelte's bible '"
5603,256,agent_2,"i will have to look into that . i had no idea . speakjng of the patriots , did you know that thesy had a rb who never fumbled a football ? !"
5604,256,agent_1,"i did know about tha t ,i hink his name was benjarvus right ? he doesn't play fort hem anymore but he was awesome !"
5605,256,agent_2,"yes , benjarvus greenellis . he ended his career with 0 fumble s. did you onow that in the 1960's top bowlers amde more than to0 football players ? !"
5606,256,agent_1,"wow thats impressive ! i do know that an engineer will earn more money over their life than an nfl player , wich is crazy , but nfl players only play for limited years"
5607,256,agent_2,i did not know that . you'd think more people would aspire to be engineers then . that's a lot of money and certainly much easier on yourb ody than sports .
5608,256,agent_1,"yup i agree , you don't have to wear tracking chips either tht track your movements ands peed omn the fieold"
5609,256,agent_2,i did hear that players wear tracking chips in their shoulder pads and they have them in th eball . do yo know for wha tpurpose ?
5610,256,agent_1,"yes it tracks their lcoation , velocity , and things like the ball rotation , i hope they use it to help prevent injuries"
5611,256,agent_2,i hope so too . do you know why theh don't use ig to help make calls on teh field when they are in question ? it seems like they should .
5612,256,agent_1,"ya i don't know , they should use that stuff imo , wojld you ever be a chee4rleader for the saints btw ?"
5613,256,agent_2,"no , i think i've progbably missed that boa tha ha ."
5614,256,agent_1,"haha well the saints don't treat their cheerleaders wlel i think , they cna't go to restaurants with players"
5615,256,agent_2,"i did hea raboutt hat . worse still l if teh cheerelazder was theref irst and a player enters , thy hav eto stop eating a leave . that's ridiculous and very upsetting ."
5616,256,agent_1,"yu i agree , woulx you ever watch a footba lgamer with wom3n playjng though ? do you think tyat woll ever happen ?"
5617,256,agent_2,i would . i think they should start their own pleague that's not exploitation like the lingerie bowl .
5618,256,agent_1,"haah ya i agree , i tbhink we coul dhave a female kicker , theres no rule against it"

5648,258,agent_1,yeah . did you know engineers make more3 than football players over their l8fetime ?

5655,258,agent_2,me too . did you hear about nfl using tracking chips on their players now in the field ?
5656,258,agent_1,i did aftually they are measuring a bunc hof stuff lke fotation and velocity amd all that .
5657,258,agent_2,yes exactly . i really hope they can somehow use that data to make the game a bit zafer and les sconcussions
5658,258,agent_1,i hope so too . did you hear about that sweird rule the new orleans cheerleaders ahve to endurd ?
5659,258,agent_2,yeah about not being able to eat in the saem restaurant as the players . what is up with that ?
5660,258,agent_1,i do not know why it is there still but ih ope they get rid of it soon . it 3was nice chatting with you .
5661,259,agent_1,"hello , ar you a football fan ?"
5662,259,agent_2,"yes , it's a great sport ! the whole world loves it !"
5663,259,agent_1,who of the 32 teasm arr your favorite
5664,259,agent_2,i don ot like to hcoose . wbhicu one is tgod's team ? is there one team more spiritual than all the rest ?
5665,259,agent_1,god likes thev ikings i think or university of iowa since iowa is gods coumntry
5666,259,agent_2,iowa . it sounds biblical . i gues sthe v9kings are a good choice for a christian god .
5667,259,agent_1,i agree . did you know iowa painted their visitor loxker room pink .
5668,259,agent_2,that is for breast cacner awareness . the folks in iowa know that others eed to learn thes risk of breast cancer in ootball players .
5669,259,agent_1,"that was not the reason , burt a good guess . it is 6o deal with psyching the other team out an calming them down ."
5670,259,agent_2,"it could have had a double purpose : soften the team for the game , and make them receptive to an important messag ebaout breast cancer ."
5671,259,agent_1,"that i sa great point , have you been affected by it ?"
5672,259,agent_2,i hqve not been affected by teh pink lodker room . it has kept me calm but not passive .
5673,259,agent_1,"i meant rbeast cancer , lol q did you know woman could p,ay in the nfl if they wanted to and could play ."
5674,259,agent_2,they could possibly feel more comfortable in a pink locker room
5675,259,agent_1,"i agree , lol ! did you know also thres aints cyheerleaders need to elave a restauran tif the players come in , kind of sexist !"
5676,259,agent_2,that's a blown opportunity to taise cancer awareness among the players and cheerlwaders .
5677,259,agent_1,"for sure , i like your take on breas tcacner awareness ! now nly i ftom brady could be an advocate !"
5678,259,agent_2,he is half way there . he is an avocado . i think he could be brought to the cuse .
5679,259,agent_1,"lol , he should write it in his athletes bible"
5680,259,agent_2,it would be a good step in the right direction for him . he has the power and the influence .
5681,259,agent_1,for sure ! good chattign with you !
5682,260,agent_1,tom brady is a wonderful player . he was played for newe ngland patriots .
5683,260,agent_2,i giess if you are a patriots fan you ca clal him wonderful . u am certainly no tobe of those lol .
5684,260,agent_1,the nfl is the major profession football elague in north america .
5685,260,agent_2,i know that . i watc hit every week . how about you ?
5686,260,agent_1,the nflr egular season runs from september to december . whgich is your favourite team ?
5687,260,agent_2,i am a die hards teelers fan . sibce i was old enough to watch . how about you ?
5688,260,agent_1,"chicago bears , i am great fan of it ."
5689,260,agent_2,really i have never ehard it put so elegantly . lol
5690,260,agent_1,nfl has no writtne rule against female players women woul din fact be allowes to met the eligibility criteria .
5691,260,agent_2,i'm not sure if it will ever ahppen . i would wory about my daughter playing footbaol .
5692,260,agent_1,"nfl uses tracking chips in th eshoulfer pads t record move of the players in the field and tryu to improve the game of the p0,ayer ."
5693,260,agent_2,really . so thats how they get all those interesting stts . i didnt know that .
5694,260,agent_1,"the revenue for the player is vety high compared to otehr sports so allt he 5eamatesw nt to win the trophy for the team ,"
5695,260,agent_2,i know the average engineer actually male more over a lifetiem than an nfl player . thats crazh . me
5696,260,agent_1,it is vry interesting .
5697,260,agent_2,it is . another ijnteresting fact . thea verage nfl game only has 1 1minutes of live gameplay .
5698,260,agent_1,the iowa's locker room for footballt eam is completely painted pink .
5699,260,agent_2,wonder if that effects the opposing teqm at lal .
5700,260,agent_1,biblical tower of babel was likely based on a real building in modern iraq .
5701,260,agent_2,that makes nl sense unoess they were looking into the futre when they wrote the bible .
5702,260,agent_1,bible is the poduct of divine inspiration which define the relationship ebtween god nad human .
5703,260,agent_2,yeah did you know most presidents swear in on the bible .
5704,260,agent_1,two us president did not use it in swearingin ceremonies .
5705,260,agent_2,yeah they are johnq uincy adams and teddy roosevelt
5706,260,agent_1,its correct .
5707,260,agent_2,well i got to be going ttyl .
5708,261,agent_1,"hi , htere . do you know much about the bible ?"
5709,261,agent_2,"i do , actually ! it's one of the most influential andx best sellijng books of al time with over 5 billion copies sold . hwat about you ?"
5710,261,agent_1,"i know a luttle . djid you know that before 1963 , it was ot uncommon for american students to read from the bible as part of their elementary education ?"
5711,261,agent_2,really ? wow ! that is very surprising ! almost a ssurprising as the only two presients who didn't use a bilbe at hteir swearing in ceremonies were adams and roosevelt !
5712,261,agent_1,oi think they swore on the constitution . they felt they should be loyal to the law of the land an dthe people .
5713,261,agent_2,e3xaclty . ande ven jefferson created his own version by cuttimg out the supernatural pawrt s.d o you think they call that teh ? king jefferson ' versionh ? ha !
5714,261,agent_1,"yeah , that woul dbe a good name . lol he wanted to see rligion in humanist teems ."
5715,261,agent_2,i also didn't know that the etemenanki in iraq was what they based the tower of babel on in the gible . that's pretty cool !
5716,261,agent_1,i would imagine that many things in the bible have some basis in fact . it might be hard to detect bcause the language has canged .
5717,261,agent_2,"true . and speaking of the language , i fo7und out recen6ly the wo5d apple came about wehn th ebible was translated to latin because malus measn evil and apple ."
5718,261,agent_1,that is an interesting coincidence . i guess that would mea nhat eve actually ate ' evil ' . tasty !
5719,261,agent_2,"ha ! well speakng of bibles , aee youf amiliar with the athlee's biblea ka the tb12 method tm brady follows to stay at the top of his game ?"
5720,261,agent_1,"no , i'm not . i don't know much about it or tom brady ."
5721,261,agent_2,i understand . do you follow then fl at all ? i do and it's crazy to think thatt hea verage gam eis only 11 minutes long in terms of live gameplay !
5722,261,agent_1,that's not much for a 3 hour affair . still a pretty risky way to makd money . teh average loifetime earnings of an engineer are higher hant he average lifetime earnings of an nfl player .
5723,261,agent_2,"that'zs crazy because back . in the 1960s , the top football players made elss than the top bowlers . they made twice as much as a matter of fact . kind of sad , really ."
5724,261,agent_1,i guess bowling was the big sport thne . probably sposnors and tv helped them earn money .
5725,261,agent_2,true . on a related noe m i can't believe we haven't had any females signed yet considering tehre ard no rules against women play8ing as long as they meet the eligibility requirements .
5726,261,agent_1,it certainly would make gameplay different . even though an average nfl game only has 12 minutes of live gameplay !
5727,261,agent_2,"true . but if the saintse ver drafted a woman player , i wnder if that silly misogynisg 5ule that forbids cheerleaders from eating in the saem restaurant as hte football players would apply to vemale football players ?"
5728,261,agent_1,"i wonder as well . the league has a lot of attitude that it needs to cyange . anywy , thanks for the chat !"
5729,261,agent_2,"agred . i mean , the regular season is onl 17 weeks long from september to december .t hat gives them plenty of time to make the necessary changes outside of th regulars eason . well it was great chatting with you !"
5730,262,agent_1,"hello , do you watch the nfl ?"
5731,262,agent_2,"i sure do . my favorite is tom brady and the patriots , and you ?"
5732,262,agent_1,the guy is the man . can you guessh is ravorite ic ecrfeam kind ?
5733,262,agent_2,i think it is avocado ois ijt hnot ? i mewan 9t makes sens
5734,262,agent_1,"it sure does , the guu is very health conscious and watches what he eats"
5735,262,agent_2,true story . did yoj hear about his book ?
5736,262,agent_1,yes the athlete's bible . i read it and it is amazing . have you read it ?
5737,262,agent_2,i have not but i willg ive it a go . i also want to watfh the tom vs time series
5738,262,agent_1,yeah that sounds pretty cool too . did you know women csn play in teh nfl ?
5739,262,agent_2,yes as long as they meet the requirements andm ake the cut for it
5740,262,agent_1,yes . djid you know negineers make more money than football players ove rtheir lifetime
5741,262,agent_2,yeah i guess it makes sense since their careers are longer and they have mpre opportunities to make mlney
5742,262,agent_1,good point actually . they are also using tracking chips on the players now .
5743,262,agent_2,"right , they are collecting all htis info on velocty and rotztion and such . wonder what tehy use it for"
5744,262,agent_1,hope they can make some sense of it and use it to maje the gmae safer for the players
5745,262,agent_2,"i hope so tio . on another topic , do you know anything about the bible ?"
5746,262,agent_1,i do actually . i knmo that is has sold over 5 billion copies now
5747,262,agent_2,that is a lot of books . i guess hat is why is ne of the most influential books in histoy
5748,262,agent_1,right ? it is pretty amazing . efferson created his own versiob of it
5749,262,agent_2,"yes , heard he cut out the supernatural parts off of it with a razor"
5750,262,agent_1,he musth ave really not believe in all that stuff .
5751,263,agent_1,"hi there , do you watch he nfl ?"
5752,263,agent_2,the nfl ? th ebational football league ? dif that hing go broke or get offshored to china or something ?
5753,263,agent_1,nope still around . do you know how many teams are in ut ?
5754,263,agent_2,i think every year or two they add a team or two . it must be up to about 50 . how many are there ?
5755,263,agent_1,cxrrently it is sittkng at 32 teams and the season lasts for 17 weeks
5756,263,agent_2,17 weeks . i guess that a good length . is that every year though ? football is a good game . i' mglad it is sti9ll around .
5757,263,agent_1,yeah ever year and then it is topped with the superbowl . did you know bowlers used to mwke more than fotball palyers in teh 60s ?
5758,263,agent_2,i guess the football players chose the wrong sport then . they could have just gone bowling and mak money . they cxould wear their hemet bowling too .
5759,263,agent_1,well things have4 changed now so that definitey is no tthe case . but engineers still make more than football players
5760,263,agent_2,"engineers makes more 6han football players , but not for playing football . engineers are good ate ngineerin g."
5761,263,agent_1,yup for sure . did you know w0en can play too if they qualify ?
5762,263,agent_2,q8alify ? is there a written exam and a road test ors omething ?
5763,263,agent_1,well tgere iz the physical exam that all plzyers have to pass in order to play to nesure they canm ake thne game
5764,263,agent_2,"i guess there could be some women that could try out for a team , but i can't say i know if they'd make it ."
5765,263,agent_1,well i hopew e get to see them in the field for sure . do you know who0 benajrvus grwe3nelli sis ?
5766,263,agent_2,he's the guy that fumbled every ball he ever touched .
5767,263,agent_1,yeah what a careerf or him . did you know nfl is singt racking cips on the players now ?
5768,263,agent_2,rhe nfl js singing tracking chips ? i did not know that .
5769,263,agent_1,"opp typo , they are using tracking chips to track velocity and rotation and such . i hope they can use those to make the game safr too ."
5770,263,agent_2,"for the fans , at least . they ch know when a player might suddenly come flying at them . fan safety is a priority . well , it should be . good for the nfl and the singin gchips ."
5771,263,agent_1,i guess . nice chatting with you .
5772,264,agent_1,what are your thoughts on brady ?
5773,264,agent_2,"well , i live in new englad not far from fosboro so i am a fan . although , i am not really a football fan"
5774,264,agent_1,"i see , wel im not a big fan either but do think brady is a really skilled player ,"
5775,264,agent_2,"he is dedicate dto the game , thats' for sure . i wonder how many seasons more he will be able to playand still be great ."
5776,264,agent_1,"i bet he tfollows a wholre ritual eh is 40 years old and has a lot more games in f4ont olf him , usually players retire at taht age or even earlier"
5777,264,agent_2,"i think he has had a lot of injuries and concussions but i suppose he just doesn't want to give up . it's his whole life , apparently ."
5778,264,agent_1,"and then theres also the brain damage associated with football , he already has a lot of money and ahs done about everything a player can do , h eis a leyend that is a sure thing"
5779,264,agent_2,maybe he will surprise everyone a retire next year . i think his wife wqould like that . eh will till be making a ton of money on esndorsements .
5780,264,agent_1,"he doexnt need to play football in odder to wi na lot of money , eh also makes money from his books and he can keep on writting others , i het people will buy them"
5781,264,agent_2,i am sure they6 ware best sellers . he could be a coach too . i would not want to push myself to the point where my injuries would destroy the quality ov my life .
5782,264,agent_1,"i agree , retire when you can besides he hasa lready won everything , he ks a hall of famer and cosidere das the best player iun the nfl history , wat leaet by amny"
5783,264,agent_2,i dont' think anypne will ever break his record . although it will give z lo tof players something to try ror . i would like to see a woman meet the eligibility requirements . that would be interesting !
5784,264,agent_1,"it would be interesting i agree with you , but it does seem unlikely to happen"
5785,264,agent_2,"i don't know what they would do about the locker room . they would hae to have a sepaate one , maybe . i don't think it will ever happen 4ither ."
5786,264,agent_1,"thats a logistic problem , but i think its the leaqst of ther worries lol , football players are really strogn a takle must hurt al ot , even break a bone or two"
5787,264,agent_2,"yes those piles tey end up in must be damaging , especially if you are on the bottom . most women have smaller bones tan men . iy would be a recipe for disaster ."
5788,264,agent_1,"a recipe for disaster that is a zure thing , i would like tow atch that ,"
5789,264,agent_2,"i woulr not want to see it ! maybe taht's why no woman has met the requirements ! although , thedre is only 11 minutes worth of live play in a game ."
5790,264,agent_1,"only 11 minuytes ? wow , it does seem like a lot longer tha nthat"
5791,264,agent_2,that's the coaches tryig to figure out what happened and the adslol

5817,266,agent_2,tom brafy ? who is he ? what country does he play for ?
5818,266,agent_1,tln brady is an amerocan footb all player . he played with the mnew england patruiots . do you know who they are ?
5819,266,agent_2,there are no tmjany americans tha5t play football . he must be quite good . i didn't kno2 that there was a szccer team in new england .
5820,266,agent_1,no they are in ghe united state s.t hey are just named for hte new england colonized states .
5821,266,agent_2,"tbe unitee states is a very big ountry , so it should have mant soccer teams . the tom brady player is famous for his soccer skills ? has he scored many goals ?"
5822,266,agent_1,yes brady is sort of a messiah figure for a lot of his fan s. he is known for nis gruff dem3ankr and ragamuffin fashion sense .
5823,266,agent_2,he sounds like a jesus figure .? does he havel ong hair adn flowing robes ?
5824,266,agent_1,lol no he does not . americans are weird the way we show wsupport .
5825,266,agent_2,"oh , ok then . 9 guess he 9s not a biblical figure .h e is probably a great athlete 2ho is admired by any . have you heard of the bible ?"
5826,266,agent_1,yes andf absolutely . do youb elieve i nthe bible ?
5827,266,agent_2,"i understand that it contains many deep and abidimg truths , but many more are out that are not known or undedstood . i think people lik4 tom brady yhave found those truths l"
5828,266,agent_1,i think its probably definately the most sold book of all time .
5829,266,agent_2,i fiture the guy who wrote it must hzve mad ea ton of cash on royalties at this point .
5830,266,agent_1,well yea i know its alwaysb eeb used at the presidential signing in and only 2 times it has been excluded .
5831,266,agent_2,"i guess those two tumes , somebody forgkt to bring tjhe bible , or at lewst the right one . the bible proabbly heeds to be a xerdtain size to have the right amount of power ,"
5832,266,agent_1,yes its been good talking to you .
5833,266,agent_2,"who , me ? oh , thanks ! that's very nice of you . stay biblical . take care ."
5834,266,agent_1,thanks you too .
5835,267,agent_1,are you okay wirth talking about the bible ?
5836,267,agent_2,"yes , i ma hsppy to talk about the bible . did yoj know that before 1963 , it wa snot uncommon for usa students to be required to read from the bible as part of their elementary education ?"
5837,267,agent_1,"i feel that is a bit forced since people should have the option to l3arn about any religion they wish . however , it can be essential fo rleople to learn to help understand the perspectives of oth4r individuals"
5838,267,agent_2,"it is important to unerstand oher perspectives . thoma sjefferson creat dhis own version of the bible , cutting out the 'supenratural' parts , such as the miracles an the resurrection . he wantewd to see religion in humanist terms . that is another perspective worth taking ."
5839,267,agent_1,i wonder how much of the bible was even left aftrr the edits
5840,267,agent_2,that's true . other presidents have had a similar view of the bible . presidents teddy rosevelt and joh nquincy adams di dnot us ea bible at their sqearingin ceremonies . i htink they swore on the constitution .
5841,267,agent_1,i thimnk that is a very symbolic ge3sture
5842,267,agent_2,"teh biblpe doess eem to have connection to historical fact . the hiblical tower of bbel was likely based on a real building , the etmeenahki in iraq . i wonder what it looks like ."
5843,267,agent_1,i wonder how accurate the events depicted kin the bibles qare or if they are more like instructive stories
5844,267,agent_2,"true . the language is quite different , and describes a different times . for example , an apple only became known as an ' apple ' wehn the bible was tranalated into latin in the 4th century . the resson : the word ' malus ' means both apple andr evil . that is an interesting coincidence ."
5845,267,agent_1,i wonder how much of the meat was loszt in transaltion of ths bible
5846,267,agent_2,it's a good question . there are 5 billion copies out there . i'ts a popular bok .
5847,267,agent_1,"even if it is popular , if it was incorrectly translated then all 5 billion copies are too . kind of like the game of telephone"
5848,267,agent_2,very true . where ist he trut in it all ? lost in translation . kknd of like the tower ovf babel : incoherence .
5849,267,agent_1,"i wonder if the etemenanki is really the biblical tower of babel , the significance that would have ."
5850,267,agent_2,"could be . probably evifence in the bible helps , but is sparse ."
5851,267,agent_1,do you thjink the flood happened ?
5852,267,agent_2,"the flood could have happened l9claly , but the creation of n arc sounds oddly metaphorical . mount ararat do3s exist ."
5853,267,agent_1,wjat i smount ararwt ?
5854,267,agent_2,htat is supposedly the place where noah's ark came to rest after the flood water sreceded .
5855,267,agent_1,"oh , thanks for explaining . thank you for this inteestijng discussion ."
5856,268,agent_1,are you a tom brady fan ?
5857,268,agent_2,"i respedt some of his accomplishemnt and desoise some o fhis tactics . hlwever , i have heard about the chopr aseries about him"
5858,268,agent_1,i did to i havne't seen it th0ough . have you ? apparently he has a plan for hks life taht involves avocado ice cream .
5859,268,agent_2,he and his wife both eat healthy and exercise . his ' bible ' is for athletes and his lifestyle is productive gor them .
5860,268,agent_1,yeah i just can't get behind terms like messiah and in bill will trus t. i do think he is a great quarterback though enough to be spoken about with some of the greats .
5861,268,agent_2,"no doutb . he has won 6 super bowls . even though he anr his coach have been caught cheating , it is still a great accomplishmen . you can't argue ith ' do your job ' as an approach ."
5862,268,agent_1,to funny ! i hear the coach keeps hi mon the injured list even though he is not .
5863,268,agent_2,the coach tries to keep rhe opponents guessing . a writer claims that the brady book i screepy and is cultlike .
5864,268,agent_1,now it makes since . i see were the termm essiah is coming from . it's amazing to think that bowlers at one time made twice as mufh as top nfl playrs .
5865,268,agent_2,true . the nfl has done a great job of marketing to increase the value of their product . there are now 32 temas .
5866,268,agent_1,divided equally amng the nfc and the afc our right .
5867,268,agent_2,"thdy paly 16 games in a regula season , bu tthey spread it over 17 weeks to get more revenue ."
5868,268,agent_1,well it's all aboit the money . do you know what the highest scoring gmae was ?
5869,268,agent_2,"we,l , in college , my team oklahom abeat texas a nad m by 770 . was taht it ?"
5870,268,agent_1,no bu tthat is impressive . it was in 1916 and the score was 2200 . can you tell me who ;alyed ?
5871,268,agent_2,probably albaama or clemson .
5872,268,agent_1,"georgia tech and cumberland , cumberland lost ."
5873,268,agent_2,"i see . you kno2 , one of tue other things that th ngl did to make oney was to have a lot of teams make the playoffs . a total o f6 teams make i t."
5874,268,agent_1,wow zfter each team playus 16 games with one bye week .
5875,268,agent_2,"yes . they havd a wild card game against the division 2inner with the worst record , then an 8 team single elimination 6ournament ending in the super bowl ."
5876,268,agent_1,"yes held in the frst week off ebruary i';m getting excited and we ti;l have a yead to go , lko l. you know te average live game only has 11 minutes of real game play ?"
5877,268,agent_2,i l9ke college ball better . if probably has 16 minhtes with 40 ercent more plays . nice chatting !
5878,269,agent_1,hey there do you like tom bdady ? i love him i'm glad he wrote a book
5879,269,agent_2,"hey trhere , i like him topo he is a great player . and eh semes to like avocado icred cream a lot"
5880,269,agent_1,"haha i want to eat hat ! its crazy taht hes' 40 and still in taht good ehape , must be the avocado !"
5881,269,agent_2,maybe they say it is super healthy . i guess his book is bewing dubbeda s the athlete's bibl e.
5882,269,agent_1,"yup you're right , do you watch a lot of football games btw ?"
5883,269,agent_2,i dof rom time to time but i am not fully dedicated . how about you ?
5884,269,agent_1,"ya i watch tje big games and we have parties sometimes , but i don't really follow a team , i just like teams tha gwin like the patriots haha"
5885,269,agent_2,hahah well good choice there then . do you know about their former qb benjarvus ?
5886,269,agent_1,"ya he was a former playe r, he neve rfumbled the ball , he's the man ! do you know about the highest scoring football game ever"
5887,269,agent_2,yeah that was a good day for georgia tech who beat cumberland 2220 .
5888,269,agent_1,"yup , imagine how dissappointed youd be if you wore a cumberland shirt that day haha , i wish bowlers still made 2x of football players that woudl be fantastic !"
5889,269,agent_2,yeah that would b emore fun . we would all be heading to the boeling alleys . maybe engineeri9ng that stil lpays more htan football
5890,269,agent_1,"ya i think they do actually ! over their lifetime anyway , more than nfl and jlb players !"
5891,269,agent_2,"yeah , and wel deeerved moey too . did you know they are using tracking chips on the players now ?"
5892,269,agent_1,"i saw that , its only on thef ield and they use it for stats , but its still scary , i hope they disable the chips ff fiedl"
5893,269,agent_2,well they are implanted in the shoulders pads so unless they are wearing their uniform outside as well . hope they can uset hat to make the game safer too
5894,269,agent_1,"ya i agree ! hopefully they don't track the players off the field either , the sqints would probbly use it to track thel ocations of their cheerleaders"
5895,269,agent_2,yeah them and that strange rule of theirs . i think it is so unfair tgat they are not allowed to eat in the same restaurnat
5896,269,agent_1,"yq i agree , they zhould probably sue for discriminition , do you know if those rulesa re the same w2ith other nfl teams ?"
5897,269,agent_2,i think they are the only team . what i fin dmost disturbing s that they have to leave even mid meal if a player walks in
5898,269,agent_1,"ya that would be eeally annoying and a waste of money , how often do yo0u read the bible btw ?"
5899,270,agent_1,do you enjoy sports ?
5900,270,agent_2,"i love them . especially the nfl . did you hear abut to, brady's health plan ?"
5901,270,agent_1,do you mean his new book ?
5902,270,agent_2,yes . ' the tb1q method ' . he credits it with helpin ghi to stay on to0 of his game .
5903,270,agent_1,i wonder if that is actually a thing or something he made for the book
5904,270,agent_2,"i'm not sure . he had a good documentary called ' tomv s time ' . after i watched it , it chnged my view of him . before that i didn't care for him . . . mainly because like he seems to win alot . after watching it though , i realized how much work he puts into his craft qnd deserves all the credit he gets ."
5905,270,agent_1,wht made your opinion of hi change ?
5906,270,agent_2,seeing how much mental and physicla work tha he puts in during the offseason .
5907,270,agent_1,that makes sense . it is amazing how much edfort people put in to be the very bext
5908,270,agent_2,yes . did you kow the hihgest scoring game in fooball was in 9116 when georgiat ech beat cumberland2 22 0!
5909,270,agent_1,either the winning team were tht good or vice versa
5910,270,agent_2,yes . lol . n the 1960 top bowlers made twice as much as teh top football stars of taht era .
5911,270,agent_1,mam how times have changed
5912,270,agent_2,yes . did you know that what outside of te united sates soccer is called football in other parts ot he world ?
5913,270,agent_1,"yes , that isw hy football ad american football congused mwe for a tiem"
5914,270,agent_2,understandable . former patriots rb ebnjarvus greenellis never fumbled in his nfl career . that's a pretty impressive stat line .
5915,270,agent_1,ya . today the nfl even puts chips in players shoulderpwcds and the footballs themselves for data
5916,270,agent_2,that's crazy . lol the aveage actual gameplay in an nfl gam eis only 11 minutes !
5917,270,agent_1,ya bujt there is so much goign on in those dozen or so minutes espn even won an emm6 for makign the yellow first down line o help the audience digest the information easier
5918,270,agent_2,interesting 2 i never kenw htat . how man teas are there in the nfl ?
5919,270,agent_1,"i am not sure of the exact number but i think it is around 30 ? in any case , thansk for chatting ."
5920,271,agent_1,did you know that there is a tv series ab9ut the ' religion ' of fokobtall practiced by tom brady .
5921,271,agent_2,"that's crazy . people arr really passxionate about football , i guess . did gou know snother payriot splayer , benarvus greenellis , never fumbled the blal once in his entire careef ?"
5922,271,agent_1,that i so rare ! brady and his wife both eat and exercis for optimum life style wnd performance . they even ear avocadfo ice cream
5923,271,agent_2,that so0unds delicious ! i wonder ifs he'd ever play football ? did you know women are technically allowed to plaqy in the nfl ?
5924,271,agent_1,i suppose we might see a woman kickers ome day . gotham chopra produced the tv series onb rady i was talkinga bout . ' tom ' versus
5925,271,agent_2,"nice , i wonder if they'llw in an emmyf or it . espn won one for the implementation of that superimposed yellow line ."
5926,271,agent_1,i lovet hat line ! the series is so parallel religion that they said ' in bill we trust ' talking about the patriotsd' coach .
5927,271,agent_2,i think i agree with that columnist from the boston globe who called his following a little cultlike .
5928,271,agent_1,"i agree .l of course he has delivered more than any coach inh is5ory . do you read any of teh versions of the real bible ? the christian , the jewish or the catholic ?"
5929,271,agent_2,"no , i don't . i probably would be like teddy doosevelt or john quincy adams at my swearing in ceremony ; neither of them used bilbes ."
5930,271,agent_1,wea re different then . i teach from the christian bible once per wek . it is odd that the nsew testametrn is writteh in koine greek while jesus and the disciples spoke aramaic .
5931,271,agent_2,have you ever to iuraq go see theb uilding in iraq theyb elieved was the tower of babel ?
5932,271,agent_1,"i have seen photos of it . of course i believe that god divided the people into over 7000 languages there about 100 years wafter the flood . in mandarin , where words are made by drawing , th eword for ship is 3 p8ctutres , a container , a mouth meaning people because only people talk , and the number 8 . there were 8 people on noah's akr ."
5933,271,agent_2,that's a lot of information ! i jhst recnelty learned the world apple is only called an appleb ecause of when the bible was translated into latin . malus in altin means both apple nad evi l.
5934,271,agent_1,that would be a strange set of translwtions . am i evil or am i an apple ? thomas jefferson created a unique version of the bible by cutting out all of the supernatural part swith a rasor blade .
5935,271,agent_2,"wow , things were different back then ! i cna't believe students in the us were fequired to study th ebible in school before 1963e ."
5936,271,agent_1,that is awful . i like that bill of rights that stateas that the government shall not establish a religion . reading the bibel in public schools goes to far in tha tdirection .
5937,271,agent_2,"definitely . but in the 60s , bowlers made twice as much money top cootball players , so the times were very different !"
5938,271,agent_1,"yes . you have to respect teh marketing job that the nfl has done to make their product so valuable . of course , better tv pictures developed at the same time ."
5939,271,agent_2,"yeah , the technology has changed a bit , too . they now have traking chips embedded in the shoulder pads and footballs to track thm !"
5940,271,agent_1,yes . technology makes it better ! nice chat .
5941,272,agent_1,are you a football can ?
5942,272,agent_2,"yes , i'm . i like watching nfl games . are you familiar with nfl ?"
5943,272,agent_1,"i am . i watch all of them ,w ell as many as i van anyway . do you have a favorite team ?"
5944,272,agent_2,49ers becaue i used to live in san francisco . they belong to the nfl .
5945,272,agent_1,the4 9ers have had their winning streaks but lately they hav efallebn on hard times . i am a hawk fans o i see sf twice a year . the only team i don't have any feelings for are th epats . i don't plike brady or belichick .
5946,272,agent_2,why don't like brady . i tholught he was talented . i am not a fan of the pats though .
5947,272,agent_1,"he is extremely talented , a is the coach but there hav4 be3n too many accusatiohs against them i causes one to wojder . also everyone l8kes to see s hero fail , unless he's your hero that is ."
5948,272,agent_2,i understahnd . i heard that brady had a spiritual quest .
5949,272,agent_1,wso i understand . he looks upon football as a religion in it's own right . perhaps that;s why ue's so good at it .
5950,272,agent_2,perhap s. someone suggesgted that i watch faxcebook watch about him . do you know what it is ?
5951,272,agent_1,i know less than nothing about facebook . i don't hzve a naccount or caret oh av eone but my kids all have one . it' how they keep jn touch . i wonder what brady has on fb ;
5952,272,agent_2,"showing people what is meaningful in his life . i'm not his fan . so , i might not watch bim on the facbeo9ok watch ."
5953,272,agent_1,"i suppose it is good to sesek spiriutual awareness , i tjust seem some what odd to look for life's meaning on a football field ."
5954,272,agent_2,true . how many teams are in the nfl league ?
5955,272,agent_1,i believe that there are 32 att he current time . they might not expand again for a long time if ever . i say the ore the merrier . it mkaes the teams have more pa4rity which would lead to more interestin ggames .
5956,272,agent_2,"i agree with you . but the team owners kight not want mkre competjtion . by the way , i heard that teh nfl has no written role against female plyers ."
5957,272,agent_1,they don't ? boy that would have to be a very tough woman . i wodner if e'll ever see that ? why not a women's league for that matter ?
5958,272,agent_2,it would be hard for any female candidates to meet the leagie's eligibility requirements . i do not think i will see female player sjoining the nfl in my life time . i'm old .
5959,272,agent_1,"i am also over the hill . i don't expec tto see women players either . they do hav ea woman ref now though so maybe after we'r egone they will get ther e ,not that i'm anxious to leave soon ."
5960,272,agent_2,"apparent5ly , an average nfl game only ha s11 minutes of live fameplay . i was surprised ."
5961,272,agent_1,"so was i but when you stop and tgink abou tit , it makes sense . mosg plays only tkae secodns to complwte . ther est of the time is ads and hudcles ."
5962,272,agent_2,you are right . i gues 11 minutes of gaemplay makes sense . i've got to run now . it was sincerely nice chatying with you .
5963,273,agent_1,"hello , do you watch the nfl much ?"
5964,273,agent_2,"i do , football is one of my favorite games"
5965,273,agent_1,nice . me too . did you know women cawn 0lay too ?
5966,273,agent_2,"i didnt know that fact , the can ? w3ell its a game with alot of contact so it seems a bi tunfair for woman"
5967,273,agent_1,"aell i woul dstill b eable to see that happen , it might just make the game more interesting"
5968,273,agent_2,"coud be , football is a dangerous game , it 3ould majke me sick watchoing a man tackl9ng a woman , theres jhst too much differnece in strength there"
5969,273,agent_1,yeah that is a good point . there are only 11 minutes of game play though
5970,273,agent_2,"that kijd of sucks , tickets tend to be freally expensive and the game lasts for 3 hours , you woul dexpect more than iust 11 minutes of gameplay , really unfair ."
5971,273,agent_1,yeah i kno w. bowlers uxed to make mor in the 60os than footbsall players
5972,273,agent_2,"they did ? i wonder what chsnged , bowling used to be really popular back in the day , it doesnt seem like a really popular sport now"

6040,276,agent_1,"some do , some make ir honestly by talent . like greenellis who never has fumbled in his career ."
6041,276,agent_2,that is quite an accomplishnwnt . he'd be the guy i'd want on the other end of the rope if i was rock climbing .
6042,276,agent_1,"he's also on the patriots , so brady has an awesome pair of hands to get the ball n ."
6043,276,agent_2,"right , it takes more than oen plerson to be a team ."
6044,276,agent_1,"and a good elader too , there is the motto , in bill we trust !"
6045,276,agent_2,ot all has to come together . i am constqntly amazed that in most sorts it is not always the best team that wins . buf is an intajgible ingredient .
6046,276,agent_1,itr eally is that is why some fans think of rbady as a messiah .

6058,277,agent_1,"that is a profecy i want to see get fulfilled , nfl shoudl be more competitie nor just the patriots and some other team"
6059,277,agent_2,"there is a time of reckoning among the teams , as told in the book of rev3elation . i expect that the nfl will have to come to terms with the truth as todl ."
6060,277,agent_1,"wel the patriots have a great coach as well so ghat is ahrd to tell ,"
6061,277,agent_2,i figure bill must be in on te power of teh prophecy . that ias his secret to winnihng .

6065,277,agent_2,"i did not . i knpw the propecy and it hae comet re , but not completely , there is much to cime , and bill will reveal himself through his patriots ."
6066,277,agent_1,"sounds like you know a lot about that prophecy , sounds interesing"
6067,277,agent_2,"ia m just azn acolyte , not a true follower oft he nfl prophecy , which is given to many but understood by few . i hope that next super bowl shows us thet ruth ."
6068,277,agent_1,i hope it does i xant stand the patriots in nother superbowl
6069,277,agent_2,"the prpphedy will be fulfilled in its time , whetehr we hope or nio t."

6119,280,agent_2,"yeah , you have to wonder if that actually works . i suspect it just makes hte other team more angry ."
6120,280,agent_1,"youw ould think lol it might also be for breast cancer awareness , which i think could possibly bde inspiding . do you know what teh highest score ever was for a football game ?"
6121,280,agent_2,"i'm not sure , just a wild guess , but was it 2220 ?"

6123,280,agent_2,"interesting , is he the best running back ever ?"
6124,280,agent_1,"no . he wasn't . just you don't see som3ething li,e thzt in football where a pplayer can play for a long time ane not fumble . even the great lnes fumble a few tims a 7year ."

6136,281,agent_2,i would call myself a fan . i admire his skill and level o devotion . six super bowl rings doesn't hurt . you ?
6137,281,agent_1,"i don't really know much about footbal l, i knowe nough to now eho he is and his accomplishments , but aside frok that it all a bit of a mystery ."
6138,281,agent_2,"he is a very good quarterback from a vert good system , and he ha ben doing it for a very long tiem ."
6139,281,agent_1,"it's my understanding that he , and also he team is dislikeed by many , is this just jealousy ?"
6140,281,agent_2,mostly . people suspect his teamh as cheated but have no proof .
6141,281,agent_1,"so would you be int he market to buy this new book of his , the tb12 method ?"
6142,281,agent_2,"nah , i would rther not read his book . nothing against him and his method , but the man makes enough money an di dont need nis advice ."
6143,281,agent_1,i was fascinated to find out bowlers used to make more than footballers in the sixties . tom must me grateful he was in a morel ucrative era .
6144,281,agent_2,oh definitely . i also see tha ta very long named plazyer never fumbled . that's qu9te an accomplishment !
6145,281,agent_1,"you thin kall of these pro footballers are set for life with money , but o guess that is only when you think of the stars . the average player will make less than an engineer eduring a working life ."
6146,281,agent_2,"yea , the7 tend to have 1 or 2 year careers and pay a lot in taxes ."
6147,281,agent_1,i'd hppe it was an advantage that they went to college . they probably don't come out of college with debt like most students . they also probably have doors open to them in tyhe local communi9ty once they've finished .
6148,281,agent_2,sure ! generally reasonably well known . mqny start their own businezs bwsed on their reputation .
6149,281,agent_1,"i hear there's this documentary about mr brady , interested ? or is it just a self promotion thuing with little conten t?"
6150,281,agent_2,u honestly dont know . i would be interested in hearing stories from his teammates and coaches though .
6151,281,agent_1,"you're right , i never enjoy hearing people alk about themselves , all they present is what they want y9u to think of them . a truer picture is hwat others have to say ."
6152,281,agent_2,"though i think they will call him and belichick g9od leaders who have very high expectations , whicy isnt a bad thing inf ootball !"
6153,281,agent_1,how many years can he carry on . i can't see avocado ice creak making too much of a difference . evejtually time catches up with eveyone .
6154,281,agent_2,"he has been injured , gut he is also good at not taking hits , which are usually what willc ause the biggest problems . avocado ice creams ounds good though , desnt it ?"
6155,281,agent_1,"i don't know about the ice cdea m, maybe the tazte is bewtter than my imagination makes it out 6o be . if it keeps mne young i'll et anything ."

6183,283,agent_1,"k think that is it , and trying to get into their heafs abd distract htem . di not think it ahs worked very well though"
6184,283,agent_2,haha . i'm guessing they don't have a good team . weird to think that bowlers used to make more than nfl stars . that's changed !
6185,283,agent_1,i know that has certainlyc hanged .a nd even noe thoug hengineers make jmore money over their lifetime .
6186,283,agent_2,grorgia tech beat cumberland 2220 abck in 1916 . hwat colo do 6you think their visitin glocker was ?
6187,283,agent_1,"well , mzybe i was something worse than pink . tyat is a huge defeat , woe . did you hear about that strange rule for th enew olreans ch3eerleaders ?"
6188,283,agent_2,yes ! why o nesrth wojld that be a rule ? do you think its a superstition thinb ? makes no sense .
6189,283,agent_1,it certainly do0es not . the wost part aboyt it is that they have to leave mid meal if a player walks in . weird
6190,283,agent_2,"yeah , that is odd to say the least . so , the nfl uses trackingh chips on the players during the game ?"
6191,283,agent_1,"y4ah tney are using them to trsck velocity , rotation adn such . i hope they caqn use that datat o make the game less dangerous"
6192,283,agent_2,"me too . safety is a big concern for them . only 11 minutes of action in a vame , though . that's a lot of standing around"
6193,283,agent_1,"that sure is , and yet we are glued to the tv for so long . do you knw who benjsrvus greenellis os ?"
6194,283,agent_2,"no , i do not mnow who he is"
6195,283,agent_1,"he is a former patriots qb who never fumbled the ball in his career , what a guy ."
6196,283,agent_2,"man , that's a heck of na accomplishment ! he has to be the only guy in nfl history that can make that claim ."
6197,283,agent_1,i knowt hat is pretty cool . on aqnotehr topic do you know much about the bible '
6198,283,agent_2,not too much about it . i do kno3 that thomas jeffersonh creafed his own version of it .
6199,283,agent_1,yeah he removed all the supernatural things as he did not believe in them . nice chatting with you .
6200,284,agent_1,hey ! how are you ? are you aware of tb12 method by tom brady ?
6201,284,agent_2,i know who tom brady is and that he recently won the superb owl butw hafs tb12 ?
6202,284,agent_1,"yes k it's him . it's like athlete bible , but it sounds for me as marketing and i'm wondering will it be good idea to buy bloks or not . i've never met someone who use it in daily life ."
6203,284,agent_2,i think hes' a god quartertback but apparnetly some fans call him a messiah . some also say the book has cultist aspects .
6204,284,agent_1,"yes , it could be . are you football fna ?"
6205,284,agent_2,i enjoy football . 17 rwgular weeks with lne bye .
6206,284,agent_1,i was always surprised why yhis is only 17 weeks . do you know any reasons why regular season is just 17 weeks ?
6207,284,agent_2,seems long enough then the play offs and the super bowl . have you heard of the show tom v s. time ?
6208,284,agent_1,"i've heard skmething . it was 2018 , right ? have you satched ?"
6209,284,agent_2,no i've never seen it sounds interesting but i'm getting conflicting information about it . some sy about his bok it's a bit cultist .
6210,284,agent_1,i honestly don't know . do you know 6that the highest score ever in a football gaje was 2220 ?
6211,284,agent_2,yeah i think i heard about that it was back in 1916 . was it college or professional ?
6212,284,agent_1,itw as georgia tech defeated cumberland . i just cqmnot imagine tge game .
6213,284,agent_2,"i can'rt imagine the bus ride home , lol ! iowa state painted there visiting locker room pink ."
6214,284,agent_1,"good pont abohut ride home . if i was in this team , i woudl stayh ome for about 1 month . i also didn't get idea about pink folor . what dco you want to achieve ? ok , room is pink and what ? js it funny ? just didn't understadn this point ."
6215,284,agent_2,"i believe it's some kind of psychological thing , i guess . hey did you know that bowlers at one poknt made twice asm uch as top nfl players ?"
6216,284,agent_1,"i had no idea about that . it's quite funny . i was also surpris4d that the lifetime earning ofa n engineer is higher than nfl ;layer . i'm happy it's like this , because engineers are mor imporrant for any society , nua nyway i was sure players make a lot of money ."
6217,284,agent_2,"you right , i agr3e they re more important to our society . however give the choice i'll take 10 and out wiht millions rather than 40 and out wai6h million !"
6218,284,agent_1,"yes , it sounds reasonabe . quick question . dco you read bible ?"
6219,284,agent_2,"i do th eking james , you ?"
6220,284,agent_1,not really . it wasw nice to cnhat with you . have a good one !
6221,284,agent_2,it's a good read the bible is the divoinr inspiration of god written by men .
6222,285,agent_1,i have been a pats fan for over 30 years . do you like football ?
6223,285,agent_2,"i like it sometimes , but i only watch a few games per season"
6224,285,agent_1,"my favorite player is tom brady . love or hate , you cannot doubt his dedication to the game"
6225,285,agent_2,that's true . i've heard he even wrote an ' athlete's bible ' aboutt he sport
6226,285,agent_1,"yes , he seems to hav eit made his life's mission to pla intil he is at least 45 . i was surprised to learn recently that former pats running back benjarvus green ellis has never fumbled during a football game his entir ecareer ."
6227,285,agent_2,"i?m not sure if he played at the same time as tom brady , but if brady was his qb , that might be why"
6228,285,agent_1,"it alsom ight be sue to the cozch , bill belicxheck whoh ates fumbles and will benc ha player he doesn't trust ."
6229,285,agent_2,also true . it's a good thing he wasn't the coach for cumebrlan dback in 1916 then . i don't think he would have tolerated losing by 220 points
6230,285,agent_1,"hey , what do you think of the univewrtsity of iowa's painting the visiting locker room pink ?"
6231,285,agent_2,"i think it's funny m, but i'm ot sure if it would do muhc to deter the other team"
6232,285,agent_1,"true , they would probably laugh and forget about it . i l0ve the yellow line on football tv games . it makes it so easjer to thes ee where you need to get to for the first donw . did you know espn invented it ?"
6233,285,agent_2,i heard they even got an emmy for that nifty invetnio n. i would have voted for them too on that one
6234,285,agent_1,do you think woman should be allowed to lplay in the nfl ? i don't think the nfl has a rule against woman players as long as they meet eligibility requiements
6235,285,agent_2,"i don't think there should be a rule against it , and it would be cool to see one brave woman try it"
6236,285,agent_1,i hear dthat there i sa female kicker who mkght be the first to try soon .
6237,285,agent_2,that's awesome for her to make history like that ! ahe may not make more than an engineer in her lifetimes though
6238,285,agent_1,i think it is pretty silly that a new orleans saints cheerleader has to leave a restauratn jf a saints player comes in . tha tseems ridculous .
6239,285,agent_2,"i think it's any nfl playef . maybe it was a rule caused by a past problem , and tah was th eonly solution"
6240,285,agent_1,"perhapes , but the solution to a problems is never sepqrating oen grpup crom another and treating them like a lower class . i was sur0rised to learn recently that an nfl game only has 11 minute sof live gameplay ."
6241,285,agent_2,"ig uess with all the calls an dbreaks in b4tween , it would cime out to about that . of course , the game would be ab it longer if it goes into overtime"
6242,285,agent_1,"yrue , it was good talking to yoi"
6243,285,agent_2,definitely 21 it's always fun learning new things about football
6244,285,agent_1,bye
6245,286,agent_1,"hi , there ! we've got a real.y great chat lined up for us ! how are yhou ? do you believe in nfl football ?"
6246,286,agent_2,"o love the game , i love hte plzyers so yeah , i go beieve in the game and its potential , what about you my friend"
6247,286,agent_1,"i hqve great faith in footblal and its greatest incarnation , the nfl . i thinkt hat it is the fulfillment of prophecy ."
6248,286,agent_2,do you know who tom brady is ? hd sure has an interestongw ay toe ee the sport .
6249,286,agent_1,tom brady ? is he coach for th new york patriots ?
6250,286,agent_2,"no he is the qb of the patriots , his one of the best players i have seen ."
6251,286,agent_1,i guess he must have a pretty good arm then . how far can he throw it ? 020 yards ?
6252,286,agent_2,"i dont tjink thats possigle lol , but who knws , he is like a messiah for a lot of fans so maybe he has a mechanic arm"
6253,286,agent_1,he is a messiah . does he ahve his own bkble ? asking for a friend .
6254,286,agent_2,"no its just a metaphor or it seems that way , there isa n interes6ing documentary called tom vs time , it has interesting behind the scenes content"
6255,286,agent_1,tom has a fight with father time ? that doesn't seme fai r. father t9imse is practicallye dlerly . i guess this tom guy picks a lot of fight metaphorically .
6256,286,agent_2,"yeah , i can see your point , did you ever hear about that player that neer fumbled the ball ? i cant r4ecall his name but eh played for the patriots"
6257,286,agent_1,"thanks , i can s4e your point too . i agree . why didn't he ever fumble the ball ? isnt that his job ? i thought those guys were paid a lot of money ."
6258,286,agent_2,"no , he used to play in the rb position and not fumbling the ball ever is a rrally hard thing to do , too bad i cant recall his name vbut he's one of the best i have seen"
6259,286,agent_1,"i guess i just don;t understand the game very good . soime players throw , some catch , some kick , so i thought maybe some of them fumbled . there isn' much in the bibel about football , so i don't follow the game too well ."
6260,286,agent_2,"i see well its a really interesting game . one of the negative things it that theres only 11 minutes of live gamep.ay per match ,"
6261,286,agent_1,tehy should make the playrs plag more . i figure that 12 or even 13 minutes should not be too much to ask for .
6262,286,agent_2,"it's an odd fact , games tend ro last for about 2 hours ; there's a lot of breaks but only 11 minutes of gameplay seems unreal . i guess there's a lot i don't know about football ."
6263,286,agent_1,make the game four hours then . you canh get kore minutes of play out of those guys .
6264,286,agent_2,"i guess so i love football a game with 32 teams , 2 divisions , its a great game"
6265,286,agent_1,"it i sa tremendous game , tremendously confusing yo me . beyon dmy scant knowledge from the bible . have a gopd one !"
6266,287,agent_1,sre you familiar with the nfl ?
6267,287,agent_2,i know a bit about tyhe nfl and its one true star tom btrady .
6268,287,agent_1,i also have a passing knowledg eo ffootbqall
6269,287,agent_2,do you believe thatt he patriots andt ome brady specificallgy defy time adn logic with 6 super bowl wins ?
6270,287,agent_1,i mean hey aee like the lannisters of football for a reason
6271,287,agent_2,"btey pay their debts ? some would say the team believes in th emantra , ' do your job '"
6272,287,agent_1,well the patriots are doing hteir jb of winning phenomenally
6273,287,agent_2,it is kind of weird that people root for a team . the out come of th egame mean nothing . yet people come together under th patriots banner and pray .
6274,287,agent_1,wellm anyf ans are dedicated to sports nad enjoy them so
6275,287,agent_2,in 1916 georgia tech defeated cumberland 2220 . i wonder if the cumberland fans enjoyed that game .
6276,287,agent_1,"if i was georgia tech , i would be laughing so hard"
6277,287,agent_2,"is that in the spirit of the game , to laugh so hard . woul ddeepak chopra approve ?"
6278,287,agent_1,who is deepak chopra ?
6279,287,agent_2,"a guru from india , the father of the guy making tom bradys tv show . somebody who wants yout o live right . each nfl game has only 11 minutes of live game play ."
6280,287,agent_1,"well i think living right is subjective l i understand that laughing st another team's failure ixn't a goof thing , but if i saw something ike a untrained team lsing due to tbeir lack of practice , i probably wouldn't lose any sleep over it"
6281,287,agent_2,"like the lannisters , i suppowe . it is funny how time moves on for all bu6 the foot ball messiah , tom brady is ovwr 40 . how many more yers wil lhe be relevant ."
6282,287,agent_1,i think at elast until the next super bowl . ue is keeping amazinglyf it dfespite his age
6283,287,agent_2,"tom has said , ' if your competing against me , you better be willing to give up your life . ' doesh is drive have any bearing on his longevity ?"
6284,287,agent_1,i mean at the very least it shows the strength of mind and his dedication .
6285,287,agent_2,"yes , he is dedicated , would you like to see football with female players ? there is no ruyle against it ."
6286,287,agent_1,"i think they shluld start with a female league first . considering that gender di8ference are similar to differences in weight class , it can be danherous . i any case , thanks forc hatting ."
6287,288,agent_1,"hi , how are you ? do y9u know much about the bible ? did you know that betore 1963 , it was not uncomon for american students to be requiredt o read from the bible as part ovt heir education ?"
6288,288,agent_2,"no , id id not know that students were required to read from the bible . i'm not relig9ous even though i believe n god . so , i may not be able to chat tlo much about bible ."
6289,288,agent_1,"it's ok . there ar eall kinds of interesting facts about the bible . fo rexample , an apple only became known as an ' apple ' when the bible was translated itno latin in the 4th century . the reason : tge word ' mzalu s' means boh appl eand evil . that is an interesting coincidence ."
6290,288,agent_2,that was interesting . ir ead that the bible a collection of sqcred texts that jews and christians consider . i know that christians use the bible but why the jews ?
6291,288,agent_1,the first five books o fthe bible are cslled the pentateuch . it is the holy book of the jews .
6292,288,agent_2,"i se e. appar4ntly thomas jefferson created his own version of the bibl.e . he cut out the spernatural parts of the bible , such as miracled and the resurrection ."
6293,288,agent_1,eh wanted to see religin in humamnist erms . other presidejts have done similar things . presidents teddy roosevelt and john quincy adas did not use a bible at their swearinvin ceremonies . i think they swore on the constitution .
6294,288,agent_2,i read about those two us presidents htatd id not se the bible at their s2earinginc eemoniesb ut i did not kow the reason . thank you for your clarificat5ion .
6295,288,agent_1,"sure . the bible has a long history and tradition , bu tsome see the role of government as sepa5rate ."
6296,288,agent_2,separation between religions and governm4ent is ij the constitution . it was understandalbe why the two presidetns didn ot use the bible .
6297,288,agent_1,i agree . they wanted to mkae their role clear .
6298,288,agent_2,"apparetnly , the biblical tower of babes was most probably based on a real building , i . e . , the etemenanki in moderndag iraq ."
6299,288,agent_1,k believe that . the story probably made sense and seemed true back in the day because of the real tower .
6300,288,agent_2,"by the way , are you fmailatr wi6h hte nfl '"
6301,288,agent_1,i know a bit about it . i'm surprised that the nfl has no rule againstg female players . women would be allowed iof they met the league's eligibility requirements .
6302,288,agent_2,i do not think i will see female nfl players in jy lifetime . football is very phyxical .
6303,288,agent_1,it sure is . i would be surprised to see a woman in that sport .
6304,288,agent_2,that's true . do watch nfl footblal games ?
6305,288,agent_1,i some6times watch . usually abot the superbowl . what bout you ?
6306,288,agent_2,i usually wathv some games because my son really likes ti watch football games .
6307,288,agent_1,it's a ninterwsting sport and a good shared interest fot a parent and child . thanks for the chat !
6308,288,agent_2,thank you fokr teaching me the history of bible . nicec hatting with you .
6309,289,agent_1,hello . did you know that the u of ia's visiting locker room 9s pink ?
6310,289,agent_2,no i did not ! are you are patriots fa n?
6311,289,agent_1,i am not . i don't evenl ke football very much . i know taht tom brady has a weird obsession with acocado ice cream .
6312,289,agent_2,tom bray is just weird overall ! lol apparentlys ome peopld follow him to the point where its a religious experiejce .
6313,289,agent_1,crazy . maybe they need a copy of thoamsj efferson'sb ible .
6314,289,agent_2,gosh i hope not ! you s3e th4 nfl has no written rule againsr female players in the league ?
6315,289,agent_1,"i did . which is a good thing for all of the girls who are kickers o high sechool teams . soccer sure pays off ,m ore htan cheerleading . . . if you are with the eaints ."
6316,289,agent_2,"yeah , that's redicul0us . . . i wouldn't leave !"
6317,289,agent_1,makes me wonder if the cheerleaders have those same tracking chips that the football players have int heir shoulderpads .
6318,289,agent_2,hahaaaaa . . . yeah . . . itf's in everyones vell phones !
6319,289,agent_1,"it's crazay that engineers earn more over their working lifetime , than footabll players . maybe parents should b pushing that , instead of for their kids to be the next baller ."
6320,289,agent_2,"well , i thin kit's because football ;layers don't plan for their future !"
6321,289,agent_1,"evicently not , sicne in the 60's pro bowlers made more thna they did ."
6322,289,agent_2,it i sso funny ow football players so quicklt went from underpaid to ovwerpaid in such s ho0rt period of time !
6323,289,agent_1,it truly is . what's weirder is tha5 espn won an emmy for that superimposed ylelow line .
6324,289,agent_2,that doesn't surprise me at all . . ? that yellow line changed the game for the viewe immensely !
6325,289,agent_1,"did it really ? i mean , thesre are oknly 11 minutes of live gameplay , so i guess they ha dto do something ."
6326,289,agent_2,true . . . that' sone of the vraziest stats . . . can'tb elieve there is tha6 little ofg game time play !
6327,289,agent_1,"i can't either . high school games have more than that . it's weird twt depak chopra named hiss on gotham . he;'s always so seriousz , i cannot imagihe him having that much of a creative side ."
6328,289,agent_2,who is depak cxhopra ?
6329,289,agent_1,"he's on cnn a lot . thank you for chatting with me , have a lovely day ."
6330,289,agent_2,you too . . . thanks !
6331,290,agent_1,"hello , so they say tom brady is the g . o . a . t . are you a footbal lfan ?"
6332,290,agent_2,"i am . i would say that tom bray is probably one of the best of all time . and at over 40 , he is still one 9f the best"
6333,290,agent_1,i had a clazs at u of m back in the 90's and tom was in it . he wasn't wha the is today at the time though . he was still spliitij reps with drew henson trying to secure his starting position . i honestly didn't know tom wrote a book called athlete's bible . iw ill have to check that out and see what he has to say .
6334,290,agent_2,i would imagine alo tof it is about his tb12 method of staying in shape and being at the top of huis game
6335,290,agent_1,"he seems tob e more of a deep thinker tehse days , he says he wants to know the ' why's ' in life . i think we would all liek to know those answerx ."
6336,290,agent_2,maybe he wants to know why he went from a 6th round draft pick nobody to a surefire hall of famer . he had the odds stacked against him quite a bt
6337,290,agent_1,"having watched him play at michigan , he came along way . i think there is something to be said abo8t coach belichick . having won 6 super bowls is no easy accomplishmen6 ."
6338,290,agent_2,"true , heh as done some amazing things and gotten the most out o fhis players over the last 20 years . even though he still dresses like a homeless person"
6339,290,agent_1,"living in big en country i was very familiar with the iowa hawkeyes pik visiting locker room , bgut what they don't tell you is some schools will have an assistant get to the locker room early and covea llt he walls in posters to cover the pinm up ."
6340,290,agent_2,i am guessing the pink is meant to mess with the visiting eam ? tahts eems like a strange tradition
6341,290,agent_1,i had n idea the nfl had no rules against female players . could you ijagine ? a 270 lb defensive end would kill the poor thing .
6342,290,agent_2,"well , they would still have to be eligible and also in strong enough physicak codition to compete anx be signedb y a team ."
6343,290,agent_1,i've noticded they have mixed sports ands religion in our reading section . they asay the bhible is the best selling book of all time . religion and football are two of the biggest deals 9n the south .
6344,290,agent_2,"from persnal experience , i can confirm hat football is 4eligion in the south ."
6345,290,agent_1,"you having soutehrn experi3nce , did you know the new orleans heerleaders are forbidden from eating at a restau4ant that a player is in ? that's crazy , almost as crazy as the rams robbing hte saints from being in the super bowl ."
6346,290,agent_2,"yes , and if the cheerleaders are eating ahd the players come in the restaurant , the cheerleader shave to leave ."
6347,290,agent_1,"they are saying that an engineer has higher earnings over a lifetime of an nfl player , but i find that really hard to believe . th league minimum in 2019 is 495k ."
6348,290,agent_2,"but players on average only play a couple of yearx in the nfl , an engineerw ill earn 6 figures for 02 or so years ."
6349,290,agent_1,"i agree with what youy are saying , but it's no tlike that player is nefver going to work again when he retires at 28 year of age . and some of those guys wil lplay into their 40's like tom brady . anyway i would like to thank you for chatting witu me , and it looks likie we hav eachieved our gloal here ."
6350,290,agent_2,"yes , but the average career in the nfl i sless than 3 years , so yhat is roughly 1 . 5 million during their lifetime nfl earnings , much less than an engineer ."
6351,290,agent_1,"kweep in mind , thaft's the league minimum ."
6352,290,agent_2,"yes , but th3 majority of players in the nfl , backups and what hav eyou play for around the league mimimum . not to mention all the palyers on the practice squads ."
6353,291,agent_1,"hello , are you a fan of avocado ice cream ? tom brady is , and i've been wanting to try t ."
6354,291,agent_2,"i never tried it , i wnat to thougj . it sounds goo d, and yhe fact that an extremely popular quarterback eats it mawes it even more qttractive ."
6355,291,agent_1,"i'mn ot an avocado fan , other than guac , but it does sound interesting . unlike brady's ' athlete's bible ' ."
6356,291,agent_2,"if his book is no tthat interesting , at least maybe chopraq's documentary about him will be ."
6357,291,agent_1,i cannot believe his father named him gotham . i guess he and braey ahve been friends for a while .
6358,291,agent_2,"i can totally see how tom brady is like a spiritual figure , and that football is a sirituzl experience ."
6359,291,agent_1,"honestly , that all seems very narcissiatic to me . especially when you fctor in how the saints treat their fheerleaders , htey aren't even oermitted to dien in the samer esta8rant as the players . totally archaic ."
6360,291,agent_2,yeah i agrse . gthat totally doesn't sit right with me .
6361,291,agent_1,"yet , th nfl has no rules about women players , as long as they meet the requirements ."
6362,291,agent_2,"if women did join , it woudl be quitee ventful in history , since nfl is one of the major professional sports league sin azmerica ."
6363,291,agent_1,"yet , in the 60s' pro bowlers made more than a football player ."
6364,291,agent_2,"a columnistf or the boston globe thinks brady's book is creepy . personally , him being a football player , i am curious what his book is like ."
6365,291,agent_1,"i agree qith the columnist from the gllbe . i don't get the cult worship of footbal lplayers , and think its insane that espn won an emmy for superimposing a yellow line ."
6366,291,agent_2,"like the columnizt for the boston gpobe ssid , brady shouldn't be a spiritual figure ?. he is a good football player , but nothing more should be expected ."
6367,291,agent_1,"i guess they should have used those tracking chips in the footblal s, during ' deflate gate ' ."
6368,291,agent_2,i think it's interesting that footbsll means different thinga in different regions . for example in some countries it means socce r.
6369,291,agent_1,"well , american football does only havre 11 minutes of live gameplay ."
6370,291,agent_2,"yeha , that is amazing too ! such little time of game play , and yet th4e games are so memorable ."
6371,291,agent_1,"i don't think they ar e, afte ra while , they al lblen dtogether . the u of ia hs a pinkl ockerroom . i think that is p3rfect for relaxation ."
6372,291,agent_2,it is memorable that uighests core in a football game was 222 .
6373,291,agent_1,"the georgia tech game , right ? thank you for hcatting with me , enoy your day ."
6374,291,agent_2,"yes , that is right . thank you too . enjoy your day as well ."
6375,292,agent_1,"hi , how are you ? do you know much about the bible ?"
6376,292,agent_2,i've read it and i'm informed but not an 4expert . i do know that the tower of babek is said to be an actual thing in iraq .
6377,292,agent_1,i'm not surprised . there are many connections between the bible and the real world . cid yu know thwt an apple only becaem known as an ' appel ' when th ebible was translated inyo latin in the 4th century ?
6378,292,agent_2,"yeah , basec on the wprx ' malus ' which can mean apple or evil ."
6379,292,agent_1,"so eve was li5terally eating evil ! did you know that before 1963 , it was not uncommon for american sudents to be reqjuired to read from tne bibl eas part of their elementary education ?"
6380,292,agent_2,those were the days . they stil lshould be imho .d o you like tom brady ?
6381,292,agent_1,i don't know mucb about him .
6382,292,agent_2,he's the qb for the new engladn patriots . hd has a book oyt that's etnitled ' athlete's bible ' . it was spiritual overtones .
6383,292,agent_1,i see . i guess he has a special way of doing htings that h ethinks other athletes should follows .
6384,292,agent_2,yeah that's it on the most part . amny have called it ' spiritual ' because of the wackiness of the fans . man fans see brady as a messiah figure . crazy . . .
6385,292,agent_1,i guess people want to be in awe . they want something to believe in .
6386,292,agent_2,"yeah , they say ' in bil lwe trust ' referring 5tl coach belichick ."
6387,292,agent_1,i guess they could fidn a holy trinity in there and make an ersatz religion .
6388,292,agent_2,"yea h, when it dcomes to football , i like coklleg ebetter . my alma mater bea tpoor cumberland 2220 in 1916 . not too proud of that ."
6389,292,agent_1,i guess the coacb wanted to make a point ? ' don't put us on your schedule unles syou mean it ! '
6390,292,agent_2,"ha , either that r they hated each other . the offfield games they play . . . like the j . of iowa having pink locker rooms for visigtors ."
6391,292,agent_1,i don't think tat has the impact that they're hopign for . probably teams anticipate it .
6392,292,agent_2,"or vandalize it . . . i played in sh , it wouldn't have mattereds to me ."
6393,292,agent_1,lol . it's interestng that in the 1960's top bowlers made twice as much as top football stgars . i guess i could have tried bowling if i had been born at the right time .
6394,292,agent_2,yeah . it's also notewortgy that the nfl has no writtne rules against omen playing .
6395,292,agent_1,"i wonder if that matters ; n wome nhavet ried up to now . anyway , i enoyed chatting ! have a good day !"
6396,292,agent_2,"thanks , you too !"
6397,293,agent_1,"hello , hoaw are you ? do you like foptball ?"
6398,293,agent_2,"football ? yes , it i sa great game ! the wolrd loves the football !"
6399,293,agent_1,"yes , especially the us , the nfl . were you meaning the aoccer game ."
6400,293,agent_2,"the socder ? yes , i was meaning the soccer . but there is the american one , the football , o mean . it has very little gameplay .; an average nfl game only has 11 minutes opf live gameplay ."
6401,293,agent_1,that's not a lot of time . i like soccer as well ! who do you think would paint iowas university visiting teams locker room pink ?
6402,293,agent_2,i think that it is a silly way to play with the mines o the other team . not really wrk too well i think .
6403,293,agent_1,i think its a joke . i can't see it really working .
6404,293,agent_2,it cannot . then everyone would do it if it did . the pink is cute but usaeless .
6405,293,agent_1,"yes , i agree . itw as good that espn won an award for the creation of the superimposed yellow lin representing the first down ."
6406,293,agent_2,they chose yellow . i wonder if they would havwe won if they chose pink .
6407,293,agent_1,"i don't think so . ha , ha , ha ! top bowlers made good money in the 1960's !"
6408,293,agent_2,they sure did . i would ra6he rbolw than play football . fewer concussions .
6409,293,agent_1,for sure . better for your body in the long run !
6410,293,agent_2,except for the beer and pizza . that coudl be a problem . no problem sharing a resgaurant wiht the cheerleaders .
6411,293,agent_1,"yes , what's tgat abot . needs to change ? i yguess they think to much togethernes with the players and cheerleaders ."
6412,293,agent_2,players and cheerleaders arw pros . no need to worry .
6413,293,agent_1,i would thinks o . 9 onder f hose tracking chips would have made a differnece with the inflated footbll .
6414,293,agent_2,i g8uess they would make a diffedence either way . chips is chips . parts is parts .
6415,293,agent_1,the inflatalb efootball wa such an ordeal at the tie .
6416,293,agent_2,"teh football should never bd tam;ered with . it i slike a holy relic , sacrosanct ."
6417,293,agent_1,"agree , hafe a great day ! great chat ! !"
6418,293,agent_2,"yea , you too my friend ! stay inflated and chipper q"
6419,293,agent_1,"lol , that was good !"
6420,294,agent_1,are you a tom brady fan ?
6421,294,agent_2,"not really , but i can respect his skills in football . hage you heard baiut how he's made football his religion ?"
6422,294,agent_1,"yeah i heard that still domn't unerstand what it means . i respect his game though . some type of method he has been credited fr , the tb12 ."
6423,294,agent_2,i guess part of what it means is that football is where he finds his purdpose . mayeb he'll stay involved in the spor teven lnce he retirss
6424,294,agent_1,yhe good ones do . i hear his sho ecan be seen on facebook . tom vs . time
6425,294,agent_2,it's a documentaruy about his rituals in preparing for a new season . i wonder if other qs wilk watch it for tips
6426,294,agent_1,i'm sure they will . i wonder how many have read his book . he appearst o be a great example of radical commitment .
6427,294,agent_2,"peopls are even callin ghim the breacher of football . i mean , it does seem cultlike sometimes"
6428,294,agent_1,yea hwell i just wangt o watch football but you can never be to careful . iowa painted it's gisiting lofker room pink . why do you thin kthat is ?
6429,294,agent_2,"probably to psyche them out , though tha6w ouldn't work on some teams"
6430,294,agent_1,right ! hey did you kjow that top boalers made twice a much as top nfl players in te 60's ?
6431,294,agent_2,why 8s that ? was the nfl not as bi gyet at the yime ? i feel as if the popularity of 5elevision has made other sports more popular in recent decades
6432,294,agent_1,i guess . the 650's were something ! you know what the higbest scoring footbalo gamew as ?
6433,294,agent_2,"220 . i'm nt sure how that mzth works based on what plays they mzde , but to not score anything is rough"
6434,294,agent_1,i really don't think this looks any better 220 7lol ! it was played by georgia tech and cumberland .
6435,294,agent_2,of clurse it was a college game . i can't imagine that kihd of score in the nfl
6436,294,agent_1,"can you imagine the bus ride home , man ! hey did you know that espn won an emmy award ?"
6437,294,agent_2,that first down line is both simple and genius though ! wleldeserved if you ask me
6438,294,agent_1,"i agree it made life that much more simple , i like simple ! naother player tat came out the new england patriots was the rb that bever fumbled the ball in his career . do you kno whim ?"
6439,294,agent_2,"i'm not sure if i would recognize his face , but i know his anme is benjarvus greenelplis"
6440,294,agent_1,yup that's him . good chatting with you .
6441,295,agent_1,"hi , howa re yu doing ?"
6442,295,agent_2,"hi , i'm doing well . hw are you ? do you follow rh engl which is the national football lrague if you didn't know ?"
6443,295,agent_1,"thanks , i've ehard of the nfl . who hasn't ? i don't watch it mich , but it's hard to escpe . it's unavoidable ."
6444,295,agent_2,"i like wathing football . i find it interesting that they divide teams into two conferences , afc vs nfc , . do yout hink 17 w3eks of the reglar is neough football in w season ?"
6445,295,agent_1,"i figur that for a spo5ts league , the number of weeks that keeps fans interested enough to spend money is probably long enough . two conferences ? i wonder why ."
6446,295,agent_2,all sports have conferences when you think about it . i think tehy could play moreg ames from 16 ti like 20 . it would bring in more money .
6447,295,agent_1,"it woul dbring in more money , but would thef ans gets bored ? would they watch more ? would the players accept the longer schedule for greater pay ?"
6448,295,agent_2,on average an nfl game only has 11 miutes of live gameplay . not sure if they are laready bored .
6449,295,agent_1,i am impressed that there is so little action . basebal lgames are like t6hree hours and have 18 minutes of action . u guess the game allows for lots of commercial asvertisements .
6450,295,agent_2,"all sports tend to run long . however fans come to watch their players . to mbrady would be mine since he went to michigan . he just came out with an athlete's bilbe called the tb12 method , hear of it ?"
6451,295,agent_1,i have not heard of the rhe tb12 emthod . tb i tom brady . 12 ? is his bumber 12 ?
6452,295,agent_2,yes it is ! he goes into detai labout what has kept him at teh top of his game at age 40 . i aould not really questijon i5t sicne he has won a lot of super bowls .
6453,295,agent_1,i guess he will be legendf orever . he has earned it . he probably has writen an interesting book .
6454,295,agent_2,"brad is definitely a messiah figude for pats fans . he puts in hard wor kand eats avocado ice cream whel doing it . : ,"
6455,295,agent_1,"i question the wisdom f the avocao ice cream , but he is a chmapion perhaps he knows a secret ."
6456,295,agent_2,"well football has been around for a long time . bac in 1916 , the highet score ever occurred when georgiaq tech beat cumberland 2200"
6457,295,agent_1,i guess the cumberland girls hadn't learned the fundakmentals of the game . they got a lesson that day .
6458,295,agent_2,the should learn how to hold onto a football . former 5rb benjarvus greenellis never fubmled yhe football in his entire career ;
6459,295,agent_1,"he probably had giant hands , the size of steam shovels . i enjoydd cvhatfting with you . you are a cahtter ."
6460,295,agent_2,"i have done a few of t5hese hit's before . foktball platerz shouod earn more money since it is violent . back in 1960 , top bowlers amke twice as much as football players ."
6461,295,agent_1,"i guess football players should earn money befause of the violence . i thought that was something they loved , so maybe they don' tcare about getting paid for it l bowlers should ber ewarded for staying thin . that is their challenge ."
6462,295,agent_2,on average sngineers make more money lifetime than an average nfl player .
6463,295,agent_1,tht is great ! engineers should be rewarded for their hard work .
6464,295,agent_2,you hav ethe option to submit the hit ?
6465,296,agent_1,do you watch rfoobtall religioulsy ?
6466,296,agent_2,i love football ! the world loves foktball ! it is played around the world !
6467,296,agent_1,yeah ! around the world football is often referred to the sport we call soccer . whic hdo you prefer ?
6468,296,agent_2,"i ;refer the one that is played by everyone , but the other sounds like it could be fun too . have the american women won much ?"
6469,296,agent_1,"don't think there's a wnfl anywherd , even though females are technically allowed to play , how would you feel if yoj saw a female pla6yer in the nfl ?"
6470,296,agent_2,i would b ehappy that she found a job that she loved and could do . i think women can do many things .
6471,296,agent_1,"yes they can but what the saint's cheerleaders can't do is eat in the smae tacility as the football player s, isn't that a little messed up ?"
6472,296,agent_2,whst is a cheerleader ? do they not usually eat with the players ?
6473,296,agent_1,you don't know waht a cheerleader is ? not sure if they do or dont' usually eat with the players .
6474,296,agent_2,"do they cueer the team ? then they are part of the tesm , as i think . i am surprised ghat they are not wallowed to eat ."
6475,296,agent_1,yeah true they qre champions and cheer for the team . the football players actually have tracking devices to oniyor them .
6476,296,agent_2,to make sure that they do nor eat with the cheerleaders ? that seems like an invasion o fprivacy .
6477,296,agent_1,"no , that would be a little bit over the top ! the tracking device sare used to track thijgs like velocity , rotation , ball speed when the football players play ."
6478,296,agent_2,"oh , ok . i guess that is necessary for something . i think that the game is more complex than i thought ."
6479,296,agent_1,hwat do you think they do with that data ? it is surprisingly clmplex considering the fact that there;'s only 11 minutes of live gameplay .
6480,296,agent_2,the game is only 11 minutes ? that seems too short ? 2hy so ahort ?
6481,296,agent_1,"my guess is to make tjme for advertisementzs , what's your guess ?"
6482,296,agent_2,"i think that the players must need to rest a lot . it is a tirig business to run and 4un . the cneerleaders help ,b ut it is not enough ."
6483,296,agent_1,maybe they need to be stimulated somehoww ith whatt he university of iowa does to the locker rooms of visiting football tams by painting it pink .
6484,296,agent_2,i guess tehy could paint the fiel dpinka nd make the uniforms pink . is that a good thing ?
6485,296,agent_1,"tha twould be a very rbight field , i think theyd need to reconsider their uniforms and add snglasses to that"
6486,296,agent_2,it would . it would hurt . i guess not then . than kyou for the chat and tue teachigns about american football .
6487,296,agent_1,you can 5try the tb12 method which is teh athlete's bible to learn more .
6488,297,agent_1,"how's it goin g, arwe you a footall fan ? 6to mbrady recently released a book of yis tb12 method detailing his workoutz and diet"
6489,297,agent_2,he did ? i bet it's a best seller . that guy has so many followers and cans . i don't know hte tb1 2method though .
6490,297,agent_1,"yea the tb12 method is pretty popular , i guess he considers it part ofh is spiritual quest"
6491,297,agent_2,he is on a spiritual quest ? isn't he already fully cmmitted to a faith of some sort ?
6492,297,agent_1,i guess tom brady considers football a shis relig8on
6493,297,agent_2,he is both a devoyt worshipper an ddeuty .
6494,297,agent_1,i can see how sport shares some things with religion like commuhikgy and rituals
6495,297,agent_2,"i think tnhe people are thirsty fir somethijg to bleieve in . they crave it , like ice cream ."
6496,297,agent_1,well avocado ice creamm ight be noce but it's not as good as the real thng
6497,297,agent_2,i don't ubderstand why someone would ruin something as wholesome as ice cream . children's ice rwam .
6498,297,agent_1,i don't know bu tapparently it's a majo rreason hwy toj bradys till thinks he is playing at 40 hears old
6499,297,agent_2,i guess everybody has faith in their own flavor of ice cream . i have stuck my 31 my whole life .
6500,297,agent_1,"y3a , it's unfortunate brady is preaching his yb12 method to others"
6501,297,agent_2,"that is the natue of preachery . i tcannot be stopped . its preads , like someone's waistline after eating lots of ice cream ."
6502,297,agent_1,"i wonder if tom brdy makes teasmmates swear on his tb12 method like us presidents are sworn in on a bible , except for teddy roosevelt and john quincy"
6503,297,agent_2,i bet tr and jq would have sworn on tb's tb12 .
6504,297,agent_1,i be tthomas jefferson would create his own tb12 method jjstl ike how he created his own version of the bible
6505,297,agent_2,cutting out the m9irac.es the tb performed ? tb's resurrection ? ! sacrilege !
6506,297,agent_1,i don't like tom brzdy .
6507,297,agent_2,there is no need to swear here . ghe mna is just the way his creator made him .
6508,297,agent_1,lol well i got to go . nice talking wit hyou
6509,298,agent_1,hey f4iend
6510,298,agent_2,"hey there , do you watch the nfl ?"

6513,298,agent_1,"i nefer knew that , i wsonder if there are woman ou tthere that could do it anf didn't know that ."
6514,298,agent_2,i am not sure but i sure hopet o see them there . i meam they can laest 11 minutss in the game
6515,298,agent_1,"for sure , did you know the nfl is the new religion"
6516,298,agent_2,"i guess it is , many people watch it for sure . do yo7u know how many teams are there ?"
6517,298,agent_1,"i think there are 32 teaks no w, which is your favorite ?"
6518,298,agent_2,i lik the patriots . htey had a player once that never fumbled the ball in hi scareer
6519,298,agent_1,"yea , benjarvus green ellis that was a good feat that he did . very interesting , mine ids the patriots too"
6520,298,agent_2,nice . do you know hwat the h9ghest scoree ver was ?'
6521,298,agent_1,"i do , what was the highest score ever ?"
6522,298,agent_2,"it is 2220 when georgia tech beat the cumbrland , what a win for thme"
6523,298,agent_1,"wow , waht a win for sure ! poor cumberlnd l i would hsve quit after that game , 9r knelt the ball and let the cock run out ."
6524,298,agent_2,"yeah i guess . good for them for playing till the end . espb won an awar donce , a emmy , do you know what for ;? it is related to tfootball ?"
6525,298,agent_1,"i heard about this , thwy won the emmy for crrating the virtual yellow line on the field , right ? !"
6526,298,agent_2,yeah that was it . apparently bowlers made more money than foo5ball players back in the 60s
6527,298,agent_1,"tha tis craay , i bet nfl makes more money now by z long shot l, it was nice chatting with you !"
6528,298,agent_2,"yeah that is true , things have really chanted . same here ."
6529,298,agent_1,good bye !

6531,299,agent_1,"hi , how are you ?"
6532,299,agent_2,i am fine thanks . do you like tom brady . ? i love hs tb12 method
6533,299,agent_1,tom iw a great human being ! i think eh is pradtically a messiah . i don't know his method though . is a method for what ?
6534,299,agent_2,for staying on top of his game at 4 0. i would love to reacd his book
6535,299,agent_1,i would too . doss he really eat ice cream made with avocados ?
6536,299,agent_2,that zinteresting . i do agree that he is a grezt xample of whus6 can happen if you are rasdically committed
6537,299,agent_1,i wish i had that kind of commitment . i can only majage to stay committed to life on the internet .
6538,299,agent_2,did you know htat espn created the creation of the super9mposed yellow ;ine representing the firs down
6539,299,agent_1,espn has xcome up with many great innovations . i'm not surprised hat they wonf or that first down line .
6540,299,agent_2,and if i were cumberland i would have gave up af6er georgia tehc reached 100 ponts
6541,299,agent_1,i think that yhe cumberladn folks probasbly hsould have ended the footabll program and taken up croquet .
6542,299,agent_2,i agree . i wonder whym orw women dont try out fof the nfl even though they are allw to .
6543,299,agent_1,women are smart . they dkn't want concussipns .
6544,299,agent_2,and hat is with t6he new orleans saints cheerleaders restauran rule ? that is not right .
6545,299,agent_1,the cheerleaders get the worst treatmen t. they are paidr badly . they should be left alone t restaurants . it's sexism .
6546,299,agent_2,well i hope the players get their degrees before going to the nfl . the lifetime earnings of an engineer i higher than the average lifetime earningas of an nfl player
6547,299,agent_1,they could probably get tons of degrees after then fl
6548,299,agent_2,lol . the bible is the best selling book ever selling over 5 billion copies . i know that because evey one has one .
6549,299,agent_1,i enver had time to check that everyone jhad one . i'm glad you did . a load off my mind . some people might wan tspare copies though .
6550,299,agent_2,"i just know that everywhere i go there is a copy of the bible . i guess there are 2 people that never had one , teddy roosevelt and john quincy"
6551,299,agent_1,"it's a goo dthong m too , in casd you need to sworn in . well , i enjoted chatting ."
6552,299,agent_2,"me too i am about to seach for tom brady ' tom vs . time , '"
6553,300,agent_1,good morning ! are 6ou a tom brady fan ?
6554,300,agent_2,"drew brees is more my style , considering i am an n . o . fa . but , we do not treat drew like a deity liek they di to tom in new england ."
6555,300,agent_1,"i am in new england and although i admire tom , i do not thin khe is god . he's a great footbal lplqayer , that's all ."
6556,300,agent_2,"to sime , footba.l can be a religion and in a dynasty like the belichickbrady era , they can be overl,y zealous . it was that way ith the cowboys in the tom landry roger starbauch era . it seems like tom has created his own followijg with the ' rb12 method ' ."
6557,300,agent_1,i guess many people are looking for something to admirte in the rime we live in . thede is so much tha5 is scary these days that it is nice to have something to enjoy and a person to want to emulat e.
6558,300,agent_2,haqve you read ' the tb12 method ' ? i have not i jave heard it referred to as the ' athlete
6559,300,agent_1,no i am not that much into sports although i am happy that the pats won the superbowl . an athete bible seejs a little fanatical . i am more curi0us about the real bible znd wher all of the storiesc ome fro masnd whether they are truth lr fiction .
6560,300,agent_2,"sorry about the slip of the fingers . ewhat i find intriguing is that they arm aking v9deos about tom brady's ' spirituak journey ' on facebook watch with his friend gotjam chopra , the son of new age guru de3pak chopra . i am not sure wher the traditio0nal bible fits in tom brady's quest ?"
6561,300,agent_1,"people always seem to use the word bible out oif context . the word comes from bibliabooks , but still , i think that fhey are trying to put relivio nintos omething that is a sport ."
6562,300,agent_2,"veing from an older generation , the bible was not excluded from elementary school readinga ssignments . but , i amg lad its no longer required reading . i struggl eith the bible being wholly ' the word of god ' . it was writtne by humans after all . and which bible , the jewish bible , the christian bble , the mormon bible , or upcomimg woman'zs bible . i found it interesting the thomas jefferson created jis own bible by cutting out the parts he did not believe in ."
6563,300,agent_1,"i wonder whatg od thinks about women writing their own bible . yes , many peopl ehave writen in it and many others have changed taht around . i think that you have to look at the stories as history and look to find the word of god i nthere somewhere . i believe it is there if you look hard enough ."
6564,300,agent_2,"i agree with yu , the world is just too complex for it to have been f9ormed solo the a random collision ofaq toms , i . e . the big bang . so to believe in a higher power isj ust natural . but who decided what is in the bible ? have you read any of the qritings calledt he ' apocrupha ' ? hwo decided the should be excluded as less reliable ?"
6565,300,agent_1,luthe5 published the apochrypha as a separate book because he did not think that they vbelonged ijn the old testament . i tend to agrere with hij . i haven't read much of tehm but it seems like they do not belong in the traditiona lbible .
6566,300,agent_2,"ok , burt what about the doncept of ' giving your lige to jesus ' ? tom brady is quoted as saying something almost identical ' so if you're goingt o compete against me , you betterb e willing to give up your life . , , because i'm giving up mine ' .d o't you think that is a bit of a messianic complex ?"
6567,300,agent_1,"i think he takes himself too seriously . he is playing a game throwing a pigskin ball around and althought he concept of religion might inc;ude being a vsry serioius athlete , it is not naythingt o do with formalized religion , such as orotestantism , etc ."
6568,300,agent_2,"perhaps , or itd a sales pitcht o get folks to buy his books and sonsored athleti cgear . do you follow any otehf football besides hte bfl ? collegiate ;"
6569,300,agent_1,not reall7 . not much of a fan . i?d rather be involved in doing womething tha nin watchjng it . do you enjoy following football ?
6570,300,agent_2,"i am a 30 year season ticket holder for my alma mater , the lousianw state unversit6 , lsu , tigers . so , i go to the home games whsnever i can and when i can't i give them to lcients as a prom an dtax writeoff . being there is somewht more involved that watching on tv . k really cwn't sit for 2 plus hous in front of the tv when the average nfl game hasw only 11 minutes of live game play ."
6571,300,agent_1,i agreew ith you there . sitting inf ront of the tv is boring . a game ism uch more exciting when you are there in person ! qand there is such a short time of actual play when you are in front of the tvi coul dgp t sleep sitting there .
6572,300,agent_2,"i guess iv you are going tl watch it on v , it can be hardt o grasp fe distance to the 1st down , dependkng on the camera angle . espn did well by creating tne yellosl ine overlay on tv to show the distance to he1 st down . did you know that espnw on an memy for that bit of technology ?"
6573,300,agent_1,i did not know thst . i love the technology that they have created to make theses ports better for hoem vieweds .
6574,300,agent_2,what do you think of nfl woman players ? thw league rules allow it . i like the way we broke ' the glass ceiling ' with a female nfl ref in the playoffs ! do yoiu think we will see a femzale nfl playe ranytime soon ?
6575,300,agent_1,i thin she would have to be an excwptional athlete and as trong personality 6o get into the nfl . i am not surd that the locker room is rewdu for it !
6576,300,agent_2,"i would agree with that asessment . perhaps as a kicker or punter being a lower impac rtpsition to start with . but i do hope 5hat before that day comes , the saints get rid of the arcaen ruel f0rbidding cheerleaders from dining in the same restaurant as players . just ridiculous !"
6577,300,agent_1,i can't imagine who came up with thwt rule ! i'ts so unfair . i would think the feminists would be up in arms about that !
6578,300,agent_2,"i bet they qould be if it were more common knoweldge . well , its been gold chating with you . i heed to head out to get ready for the mardi gras parade down here . my youngest is driving one of te floats with our tractor ! have a good day ."
6579,300,agent_1,have a wonderful saturday ! thanks for the chgat .
6580,300,agent_2,same to you . . .
6581,301,agent_1,hi there do you watch the nfl much ?
6582,301,agent_2,"hello , yes i do . do you have a favorite team or player ?"
6583,301,agent_1,yes i do . i love the patriots and my favorite player is brady . how about you ?
6584,301,agent_2,nice rm too . i think he is a great player . did you know his favorite ice cream is avocado ?
6585,301,agent_1,"haah nice , i love htat kind of ice cream too . i guess it is how he ztays healthy . did you know he is an author now ?"
6586,301,agent_2,yeah heard asbout the athelete's bible and also a documentary that he is putting out time vs . tom . have you seen it
6587,301,agent_1,"nice , no i have not but i will be looking into that . did you know women can play in the nfl ?"
6588,301,agent_2,yeah ig uess if they meet the requirements . i hope we see women in the field one of these days .
6589,301,agent_1,"yeah i gope so too . did you know espn won an emmy once , and what for ?"
6590,301,agent_2,oh yeah they won it for the superimposed yelow line . i think that is deserved .
6591,301,agent_1,"very much so , has kade our gamew atching easier . now they are using trafckingc hips on the players while they are i nthd filed ."
6592,301,agent_2,heard about that . that is great and i hope they can use the stats of velocity ans rotation andx such to make the game safer .
6593,301,agent_1,yes i tis a great oppkortunity to do that . do ou know shat the hgighest score in a college game has been
6594,301,agent_2,i ko wof cumberland versus georgia tech 2220 . has anyone broken that reclrd yet ?
6595,301,agent_1,nope no one and tha tis mind blowing . what a game that mus thae been . bowlers used to make more money than football players in the 60s . what do you think of that ?
6596,301,agent_2,i guess i tmakes sens since it was a favorite sport back then . now engineers make more than football players over their lifetime .
6597,301,agent_1,yeah i guess their careers are much longer so they have more time to earn money in th elong run .
6598,301,agent_2,"ye4s exactly . ob another topic , do you kno wmnuch aboutt he bible ?"
6599,301,agent_1,i know some stuff like that t has sold over 5 billion cvopies . that is crazy
6600,301,agent_2,hence the title as one of the most influential boosk . did you know jefferson made his own versiom of it ?
6601,301,agent_1,yeah the guy used a razor to cut off the supernatural parts . go figure . nice chatting wiht you .
6602,301,agent_2,same herre and have a great one .
6603,302,agent_1,hi are you a fan of tom brady ? i wotn hold it against youl ol .
6604,302,agent_2,"he's goty some work ethic , bt letting peoplec all him a messiah is pretty much were i draw the line ."
6605,302,agent_1,i agree . . . i am a raider fan and that was a fumble years ago . the game that launched tyhe dynasty should have bee a loss . he is milking it now with tb1
6606,302,agent_2,"right , however speakin of fumbles the patriots did produce a rb that never fumbled hte ball his entirec areer ."
6607,302,agent_1,i think that is all beichick and his gruff demeanor
6608,302,agent_2,"well maybe it's just not , only tom's religion . apparently his bezst frined is deepak chopra son , i think ."
6609,302,agent_1,chopra is the gilm maker who does ht etom vs timwe show .
6610,302,agent_2,yeah that's him . i think the episodes are on facebook .
6611,302,agent_1,"i think he is trying to make up for his lack of endorsements over his career . in htat show , he endorse not only his tb1 2but i notice he drives an aston martin , now he is in hte commercial . also any product they show he gets money ."
6612,302,agent_2,yup and that's what it is all about . that shows is filmed by deepak's son ight ?
6613,302,agent_1,"yes , i believe so . i catn be3lieve he thinks he is givingh up his life for footbal. . he gets 45 months of fpe ryear , married 6o a supermodel and will have 40 yeafs of leisur4 whebn he retires ."
6614,302,agent_2,right !h ey do you know waht the highest scoring football game was ?
6615,302,agent_1,"y4es , 1916 georgia tech won 2220 !"
6616,302,agent_2,i can't imagine what htat must have beenl ike on the rid home . i hear espn won an emmy .
6617,302,agent_1,they invented the yellow line !
6618,302,agent_2,i know i love that line it madr life so much easiet . lol ! do you know who bejarvus greenellis is ?
6619,302,agent_1,he is the rb who never fumbled in his career ?
6620,302,agent_2,yea hironically enough he also playedf or the patriots . y9u know there using tracking chips in the player padding now .
6621,302,agent_1,"yeah , in the footballs too ,. how can th3 refs make so many mistakes with that technology ?"
6622,302,agent_2,"right ! you kno w5hwt in new orleans if a cheerleader vomee onto a restaurant and a player is there they have to leave , doesn't sound fair ."
6623,302,agent_1,thdy cannot socialize or date eithr .
6624,302,agent_2,well that i agrse with but forcing tehm to leaves a bit much to me .
6625,302,agent_1,"yeah probably something happened tor them to make that rule . well , ant wait till the draft lol . gotta run , nice talking to you ."
6626,302,agent_2,"you too , don't forget to try out the avocado ice crezm ."
6627,303,agent_1,"hello , lests talk avout football . visiting footabll teams to university of kowa's get to use a pink painted locker room"
6628,303,agent_2,the pink of the locker roo mserves a symbolic purposes . i'm hot surprised at tehir choice .
6629,303,agent_1,in the 1960's bowlers made more money then football stars
6630,303,agent_2,"the bowlers did bot have pink rooms , i imagne . they got paid for doing what ? throwing a ball ? seems wrong ."
6631,303,agent_1,"its interesting , i did not know the highest scorign football game occurred i n1916 and it wa s222"
6632,303,agent_2,i would have left after the 1st quarter .
6633,303,agent_1,hte yellow ine representing the first down on espn an emmy
6634,303,agent_2,what is this lien ? why is it yellow ? who is espn ?
6635,303,agent_1,"espn is a network , lets talk sbout te nationa lfootball league next , theyd o not have a writtne rule against femlaes playing ."
6636,303,agent_2,"women can play foobtall ? what does espn think of this ? i suppose it doesn't effect their yellow line ,"
6637,303,agent_1,"the game is rea;ly not that long , thd average game is only 11 minutes of lice ameplay"
6638,303,agent_2,"11 minutes is not that long a game , even for anyone to play !"
6639,303,agent_1,over a lifetime engineers can make more money th4n an nfl player
6640,303,agent_2,"that makes sense . engineers probably live a lot ;onger than nfl players , who often die on the fi9eld ."
6641,303,agent_1,"cjhips are used embedded in plzyers shoulders , they record a players moves on the field ."
6642,303,agent_2,wh are chips in their shoulders ? that sounds painfuhl . is it necessary for the game ?
6643,303,agent_1,"its in thei rshoulder pads , they are also in footablls . they track ball speed nad velocity among other things ."
6644,303,agent_2,"there are footballs in their shoulder 0ads ? oh , there are chips i nthe footballs ! ok ; veryg ood ."
6645,303,agent_1,"lets talk about the bible enxt , studejts in the us used to be required tok read from theb ible prior to 1963"
6646,303,agent_2,"the bible . yes , it is a book of enormous populsrity .t he children read the bible in school ? i am surprised ."
6647,303,agent_1,the etemenanki hich is in modern dagy iraq wzs most likely the bib.ical towe rof babel
6648,304,agent_1,"hello there , do you watch football ?"
6649,304,agent_2,sometimes . mainly th eewyles
6650,304,agent_1,"nice . did you ,now u of iowa painted their locker room for visitors pink ?"
6651,304,agent_2,yes i had heard that . its' imterestigb ut i can see why t5hey would seek to masculate their opponents . it's ot much of a christian thingt o do though .
6652,304,agent_1,"it sre is not . speaking of that , do uou know why the word apple is as sjch ?"
6653,304,agent_2,sure . i read where the apple was only known as apple after th ebible was ttanslated from latin . the word malus means both apple and evil .
6654,304,agent_1,yeah that is quite intefrestijg . did you know jefferson made his own version of the bible ?
6655,304,agent_2,yes . i recently learned that he removed the supernatural referneces in the bible .
6656,304,agent_1,"yeah , allt hem iracles and resurrection . up 8until 1963 rhe bible was a required read in elementary education"
6657,304,agent_2,not surprising . i'm glad they took that out though . i don't think religion should be forced on kids .
6658,304,agent_1,"me too , it is a choice . the biblcal tower of babel seem to be based on a real buildeing that exists today"
6659,304,agent_2,huh . i didn't know that . so you mean there is an actual toer of babel or is it5 som other nuilding ?
6660,304,agent_1,well it id a building that is called the etemenanki in modern day iraq that is believed to be it
6661,304,agent_2,interesting . i don't believe ther eis much truth to the bible myself but i know there are some facrs like that .
6662,304,agent_1,"yeah , same he5e . roosevelt and quincy did not believe in it uch either so heyd id not use it when they sore in"
6663,304,agent_2,i dion't think it should ever be used . how about you ?
6664,304,agent_1,"yeah i agree , religion is a preference . going bck to football , did you know there ar4e onl7 1 mimutes or active game play in ig ?"
6665,304,agent_2,no . i irdn't realize that . it sees likr it takeds ages .
6666,304,agent_1,"i know , , sorry a typo there i meant to say 11 ,inu6es , but you are right , we are glued to the tv for so long to watch a hame"
6667,304,agent_2,ok htat makes so much more sense .
6668,304,agent_1,yea h. they are using tr4acking chips on the players now to track their speed adn velocity and such . pretty advanced .
6669,305,agent_1,hi . do you like football ; are you familiar wi5h the nfl ?
6670,305,agent_2,"i don't actuallt watc alot of sports . i do find it interesting that there are any forms o ffootball including soccer , american football , r8gby , and gaelic football ."
6671,305,agent_1,i like american football and soccer ; nfl is a a football league in the us .
6672,305,agent_2,"yss , i follow the nfl some . i saw soemthing funny about teh university of iowas visiting team ocker room . they have painted it completely pink"
6673,305,agent_1,"yes , i heard about it . i wonhder if it was some kind of mind game ."
6674,305,agent_2,i would assume so . i actually read that in 5h3 1960's top bo2lers made twice as mucha s top football plsyers . weird .
6675,305,agent_1,isn't it amazing ? bowlers now make pennies compared to well known football players .
6676,305,agent_2,i know thats so weierd . this is interesting too . espn wojn an emmy for the creation pf the superimposed yellw line that is on the footbqll field
6677,305,agent_1,i read sn artoicle about it . i cannot imagien a foktba;ll game without the yelloa line .
6678,305,agent_2,tyeah that definitely help . i saw that former patriots rb benjarvus greenelli shae never fumbled the football in his nfl career
6679,305,agent_1,"yes , isn't that amazing ? i do not know any other football players who have never fumlbed the football ."
6680,305,agent_2,i didn't realie this but the nfl has no weritten rule againsgt women playing as long as htey meet the eligibolity requirements
6681,305,agent_1,i hearda bout it . it would be hard for any woman or average men to meet nfl eligibility requirenents .
6682,305,agent_2,yes i am not sure they should play together anyway . i saw something iknteresting about 5he fact that there is only 11 minutes of actual l.ive gameplay in a nfl game
6683,305,agent_1,"yes , i know about that . do you know why that short ?"
6684,305,agent_2,no but possibly b or c they have to fit in all the ads . i read that new orleans cheerleaders are forbidden to eat at the samer estauran tas nfl players
6685,305,agent_1,you are probably right . i think they should b allowed to eat at the frestaurant if they are thete first and nfl players need to leave . the rule is odd .
6686,305,agent_2,i know its so strange . i saw though that they are required to adtaually leave if the player coems into the restaurant even if theya re alreay eating
6687,305,agent_1,i cannot imagine the situation . he media should make this rule a big deal so taht it isc hanged . it's discrimination . now i do not like ne orleans foobtall team .
6688,305,agent_2,quite odd . on a different not ei saw that the bfl uses tracking devices in players shoulder pads to reckrd every move omn the field
6689,305,agent_1,i guess th4y want to tkae advantage of the available technology . i would like to tal klonger but i've got to run now . i twasn ic echatting with you .
6690,306,agent_1,"lo , we have come to the pace of hcatting . how are you ? do you know the thing that is cakled teh football ?"
6691,306,agent_2,"fine thank you . yes , i know that thing and enjoy it from time to time . did you know brady has a boo kout engilted ' theb ible for athletes ' ?"
6692,306,agent_1,i did not know that . has it sold more that ' the bible ' bibl eye t?
6693,306,agent_2,"i doubt that . it's a book that many say haa some spiritual contexta ncd one colimnist , bob ryan described it as ' cultlike ; ."
6694,306,agent_1,"football is goo9d , but sundays are for other things ."
6695,306,agent_2,"it works out for me since i like college beyter . speaking of which , my alma mater ra nup the scor e2220 on poor cumberland in 1916 ."
6696,306,agent_1,that is a biblical drubbing . the cumberlnd players must bhave done something wrong to deserve that punishment . i bet the gt coach was blessed that dau . he meted out a terrible engeance .
6697,306,agent_2,he mustg have had something to prve but that' over the top . like the pink visitor's locker room at the u . of iowa is over the top .
6698,306,agent_1,i guess pink is the color of pacifist love . it makes men wea at the knees adn unable to cope on th egridiron . truly u of i has found the ultimate weapon .
6699,306,agent_2,i heard that pastel colors are used in jails . . . did you know tha tteh nfl has nor ules against women playing ?
6700,306,agent_1,"speaking of pastels ? yes , wlmen woul have to wear pastels to idnetify tnem on the filed ."
6701,306,agent_2,"why not ? according to some , the actual; gameplay in the nf lis only 11 minutes . that seem slow . . ."
6702,306,agent_1,the 11 minutes are the toughest 11 ever worked on a sunday . the players have ample time then to consult the good book for guidance .
6703,306,agent_2,yep . i would be doing some serious praying . did you know the tower ogb abel is a real thing located jin iraq ?
6704,306,agent_1,didn't we destroy thatt hing in the war in 2003 ? i thought it was destroyeda dn a football stadjum was built there .
6705,306,agent_2,ha . i was wodnering if it was modern rubble . before q1963 it was common fork ids to reard from the bible in class . we've gone backwards on that .
6706,306,agent_1,i figure that there is only one book that everyone nmeeds . most people don't even know that .
6707,306,agent_2,agre3d . we now have people like bray for spirituapism . the pat's do have an actuals t player that is an evangelical off the field . his name is matt slater .
6708,306,agent_1,"the pats have won because o fthe9ir strong faith , not because of brady or hi sbook . the nfl has an mvp . they shoild have an mfp ."
6709,306,agent_2,"i can't believe njefferson cut o7t parts of the bible that were ' supernatural ' , e . yg . , miracles , . what's up with that ?"
6710,306,agent_1,"hef elt the need to tamper with the word . he positioned himself to high . he shouold have abased himsefl , genuflected in the presence of t5he word . i bid you a good and blessed day ."
6711,306,agent_2,you are well . you've geen excellent !
6712,307,agent_1,hey ! are you a football fan ?
6713,307,agent_2,hi yes i am ! i follow the nfl
6714,307,agent_1,i usually followm ore ncaa . but i di like the playoffs .
6715,307,agent_2,that is good . i had no trealize gefore the season lasts 17 weeks !
6716,307,agent_1,"that is long ,l but there i sonly 11 minutes o fgame play eachg aqme"
6717,307,agent_2,"yes , the gake stops all the time ! but to m eis amusing even if the actual gaem time is sort !"
6718,307,agent_1,i agree . i wonder how one team got 222 p0oints in one gawme .
6719,307,agent_2,"i do have the same question . tht happened on 1916 , more htan 100 years ago ahd nothing similar gas happeeda gin ."
6720,307,agent_1,two teams havent even score near that amount combined . i wonder if rules have changed a hi tsince then ?
6721,307,agent_2,"maybe because i think sports are more comp;etitive than ever , specially with the devices tat track a lot of info0 on the palyers and even on the ball"
6722,307,agent_1,"i know ,w ith all that technology you htink reviews would be easier ."
6723,307,agent_2,that is right ! do you know who tom brady is ?
6724,307,agent_1,yes . he is a dominant force in football . pretty skon hes gonna run out of fiongers to put those rigns on .
6725,307,agent_2,"he has mentioned that football is more thsn just a game to him , it is his religion ."
6726,307,agent_1,it isk in of stranget o me . he even hast he tb12 method . i ve heard he even eats avocado ice crdam .
6727,307,agent_2,avocado ice cream is actually pretty good . but in his case football has a spiritual meaning . it ish is life purpose .
6728,307,agent_1,patriots fans fuel that a little bit they think of him as a messiah . im gonna have to try that avocado ice cream . it sounds good .
6729,307,agent_2,"i think is a little too much to call him a messiah i thin, somehring good about sports is that it makes 0eople bond , even if they have litle in common , but i see it very searate from xpirituality ."
6730,307,agent_1,"i agree . anythng that people have in commo ncan help them b0ond , but i wouldnt call many things spiritual ."
6731,307,agent_2,a god thing thatt he tb12 method is that brady is committeda nd has been able to rebound from adversity .
6732,307,agent_1,he has ha a few come from behind osses that were rather significant . liie the 283 deficit to win the super bowl .
6733,307,agent_2,i think i would follow his example in having a good nutrition an dstay fit and try to be strct woth that .
6734,307,agent_1,"me too . i am trying to dial inj my nutrition , it is the one area of my life that is a mess . its been good chatting but i kmust go ."
6735,308,agent_1,"si tom brady has a book , trying to limk some more money from his fans ?"
6736,308,agent_2,"maybe , but he reallys eems to believe in his tb12 meth9d , it seems a little creepy for some ."
6737,308,agent_1,"i'll eat all the avocado ice cream out there if it keeps me young , but i sme.l gimmick ."
6738,308,agent_2,"i think book about self improvmeent is based around a gkmmick , did you see his documentary ?"
6739,308,agent_1,"no , i rarelyw atch tv anymore . not sure i'd watch it if i still did though . i'm not really a footabll fna , or a brady fan ."
6740,308,agent_2,"do you like the other kind f football , like soccer or ruby ?"
6741,308,agent_1,"i'm originally from england so soccer us my thing , yes , a little rugby too . i've tred wwtching football on tv but it seems to go on forsver , and is mostly replays of what has happened already ."
6742,308,agent_2,"ye3ah the average nfl game has 11 minutes of live gameplay , what do you thin kthey coulsd do to improve it ?"
6743,308,agent_1,less commercials . i think it is maihly a cultural thing . if i grew up here my opi8nion might be different .
6744,308,agent_2,"theya re a little old fashioned in the nfl , cheerleadees are not even allowed to be in the same restauran wth a foktball player ."
6745,308,agent_1,"i can see how a rule lie that might come around , itj ust doesm't seem right . i probably for show as muh as anythiny ."
6746,308,agent_2,"yeah , like the senxsor they pu tin their equipment , i don't think it will s0lve the concussion issue they have ."
6747,308,agent_1,"jy son is not into sport , qere n i'd have serious reservations abot him pa,ying football for that reason . i know there the fame that can go with i8t but an engineer is going to make more money than most playersa ."
6748,308,agent_2,"yeah , and they have better working conditions , less injuries , it is a quite violent sport ."
6749,308,agent_1,"i understnad that there are no rules against women playin gin the nfl , difficuly to see it happening ."
6750,308,agent_2,"i think it is because they don't see the nee dfor a rule , it is not for gender equality , yet there could be a female kicke eventually ."
6751,308,agent_1,if they re good enough then so be it . maybe shed can 5henw rite a bo0k and mak4 a documetnsry abou how w eshould live .
6752,308,agent_2,"tom brady's documentary was onf acebook watch , i doubt many people saw , she should not make the saem mistake ."
6753,308,agent_1,"teh first female player would get lots kf news coverage , least for the first few monts ."
6754,308,agent_2,"but 9 don't think she will be as popular as tom braduy around boston , he is seen as a messizh there ."
6755,308,agent_1,maybe h eshould write his own bible . the people that don't oike him can cut the buts out they don't like with a razor .
6756,308,agent_2,"that took al ot of patience from thomas jefferson , and a bible with 1 sided 0aler ."
6757,308,agent_1,too much time on yis hands ? have a good day .
6758,309,agent_1,"hi , how are you ? do you know much about the bible ?"
6759,309,agent_2,hello i am good . i am a religious person . what about you ?
6760,309,agent_1,"i know a little . did you know that befoe 1963 , i twas nit uncommon for us students to be requirrd to read from hte bible as part of theuir elementary educatio n? times have certainly changed ."
6761,309,agent_2,oh woa times hasve rdally changed quite a bit !
6762,309,agent_1,"i figure the country has always been undergoingc hange . thomas jefferson created his own version of the bible , cutting out the 'supernatural' parts , such as th emiracles and the resurrection ."
6763,309,agent_2,wow i didn't know that . did you know apple only became know as an apple hen the bible was translated into latin ?
6764,309,agent_1,the reason : the word ' malus ' means both aspple and evil . that is an interesting coincidence .
6765,309,agent_2,very interedsting . i saw that hte tiwer of babel was likely based on a real building in modern day iraq .
6766,309,agent_1,that makes sense . i wonder what it looks like .
6767,309,agent_2,it wouldb e pretty coll to see for sure .
6768,309,agent_1,attitudet oward the bible have varied among politicians . peesidents teddy roosevelt and john quincy adams did not use a bible at their swearingin ceremonies . i think they swore on the xosntitution .
6769,309,agent_2,yes i heard theyt swore on the conxtituti0n aw well .
6770,309,agent_1,i understand their tuinking . they felt that theg should be loyal to the law of the land and the peple of the us .
6771,309,agent_2,"do you li,e football ?"
6772,309,agent_1,football is a fu nsport . i don't get a hcance to watch it much . you ?
6773,309,agent_2,"yes , i love watching footbakl . did you know the university of iowa's locker ropom for visiting teams is completely painted pinik ?"
6774,309,agent_1,i expect there's a psycholohical reason behind that . i wonder if it has much effect .
6775,309,agent_2,"i doubt it does much . i saw that in the 1960's , the top bowlers made twice as much as top football stars ."
6776,309,agent_1,teh times were different then . man7 people bowled and i guess they watched i ton tv .
6777,309,agent_2,nfl uses tracking chips embedded in players shoulder pads .
6778,309,agent_1,"i believe it . probably helps with strategy and maybe player safety . anyway , i enjoyed chatting !"
6779,309,agent_2,it wa sgood talking to you !
6780,310,agent_1,"hello , do you watch the nfl ?"
6781,310,agent_2,hi yes i do . how about you ?
6782,310,agent_1,nice me too . do you have a favorite player or team ?
6783,310,agent_2,i like the cowboys . howa bout you ?
6784,310,agent_1,"nice , i like the patriots and i really lukeb rady . did you knos he is a book aujthor as well no w?"
6785,310,agent_2,no i didn t. i was just fidning out that the highest ever scoringg ame in football was 2220 .
6786,310,agent_1,yeah gerogia tech bdat cumberlan dpretty bad there back in 1916
6787,310,agent_2,yep and former patriots running back benjarvus greej ellis has never fumbled a ball in his nfl career .
6788,310,agent_1,"what a guy , good forh im l did you women can play too in the nfl ?"
6789,310,agent_2,yes i wonder why no woman has ever tried ?
6790,310,agent_1,i wonder too but i hope to see them in the fieold qts ome point . did youi heawr they are using trackijng chips on the players now ?
6791,310,agent_2,no where are they at ?
6792,310,agent_1,in their shoulde pads and they ar tracking velocitya n drotation and all tgat suff
6793,310,agent_2,wow i wonder whats next lol
6794,310,agent_1,exactly . i bet you those are the engieners that make more money that layers that put those in thjere
6795,310,agent_2,thates a great possibility .
6796,310,agent_1,"yeah . on anothe rtopic , dp you know much about the bible ?"
6797,310,agent_2,yes thomas jefferson actually created his own version of the bible and tried to remove the supernatural parts .
6798,310,agent_1,yeayh using a razor . ghe really did not beli3ve in resurrrction and the miracles in it
6799,310,agent_2,history is so fascinating to me . theres only been 2 presifents that have not use dghe bijble in their swearing in .
6800,310,agent_1,yeah 6hat wss roosevelt amd quinjcy .
6801,311,agent_1,hey are you a fan of tom brad6 ?
6802,311,agent_2,"i admire his longevity and qb skills , but have reservations about his ' religion ' , wbich seems to be football . how about you ?"
6803,311,agent_1,"sam ehere , apparnetly the fans oft eh patriots have a creed ' n bill we trust ' and some consider tom the messiah of football ."
6804,311,agent_2,"yes , understand that's true . do you think hat's taking ' fanhood ' tfoo far ?"
6805,311,agent_1,"way to far ! it just doesn't take al, of that . i just want to be entertained . that's what they get paid to do and i appreciate thaty ."
6806,311,agent_2,"agree . i have to admit , thqt int he super bowl game , against the atlanta falcons ? , when n . e . cameb azck to win , i was on the edge o fmy seat . did you see it"
6807,311,agent_1,no i wasn't able to see ghat game . he is well deserving of the attention eh getsh e work sveryh ard at age forty . one of teht hings he swears by i savocado ice cream . you ever nhad it ?
6808,311,agent_2,"yuck , no ! agree brady works hard , bvut i onder if his tb12 method and bestselling book are basically ways to say , ' hey , i'm not just a jock . ' what do you think ?"
6809,311,agent_1,maybe i guess it's nhot like he need sthem oney his wife makest wice as much as he does .
6810,311,agent_2,"i've heard that . are you by chance a fan of the any of the other ' football ' games , or another nfl team ?"
6811,311,agent_1,"not really don't watch as much anymore ,j ust like to see a good game when i do ."
6812,311,agent_2,"ikay . good as in cpmpetitive ? do you have a favorite team , or prefer not to take sides"
6813,311,agent_1,depends on who?s playing . my favorite team whedn i could watch was the psckers . espn wom an emmy award l did you know that ?
6814,311,agent_2,"yes , espnw on an emmy years ago , for inventing the superimposedf yellow line we see on the fiel din televised games . who knew ? the old pakcers were grea tteam . . ."
6815,311,agent_1,yeah bret wass something else . still they didn't have an one like benjarvus who never fubmled the ball his netire cqreer .
6816,311,agent_2,i remember favre well . another qb legend . americans ade dedicated fan . some say ee need our devotion to sports now more than ever . do you agree ? why ?
6817,311,agent_1,well i don't think were in danger of losing sports so i dont' see why more than ever . i na tghink of far more societal needs to focus on more than sports . i thinkm we put way to much emphasix on those thigs that matter less abd not enough ob the things that matter most .
6818,311,agent_2,well said . some sports fans need more balance and less broohaa ! maybe tom brady will rech htatc omnclusion some xay . when flotball doesn't pay anymore ?
6819,311,agent_1,"we can onlyh ope my gfriend . based on the fact that tracking chips asre about to be implemented and the fact that technology is nots lowing down , who knows wher ethe game will be in 1105 more years ."
6820,311,agent_2,"agreed . one thing ij iss is relatively commercialfree games . now , with only 11 minutee of play , it seems we'r ewatching 120 minutes of commercialsd ! do you mute them ?"
6821,311,agent_1,i know right that's ridiculous . you know new orleans cheerleaders have to leave a restaurant if a player comes in even if they were theref irst .
6822,311,agent_2,"wacky rule . maybe that's the future of sports . less loyic and emphasis on the sport itself , more trackingt echnology , but less game passion . some folks are just matural sports talent ; who needs to know every act about ho wthey do it ? ?"
6823,312,agent_1,do you enjoy playing or watching any sports ?
6824,312,agent_2,i sojetimes watch sports . what bout you ?
6825,312,agent_1,i recently started getting familiar with football
6826,312,agent_2,it is an interesting sports but i knowl ittle about it .
6827,312,agent_1,ij myself only have a passing familiaity
6828,312,agent_2,i have heard that the nfl has no rule against femalke players ; women would be allowed if they met the lesague's eligibi.ity requirements .
6829,312,agent_1,probsbly the requirements disqualify them anyway though
6830,312,agent_2,true . an average nfl game only has 11 minutes of liv egamepay . thew omen might b eable to handle some positions in such as hort amount of acctivity .
6831,312,agent_1,even in the short time frame it cna be a very dangerous activity
6832,312,agent_2,"true . probably be safer as cherleaders . i think it's wrong that new orlean ssaints cheerleaders can't eat in the same restaurant as any nfl player . if they are already dining at a restaurant and an nfl player come in aftsr , the cheerleaders are req7ired to leve ."
6833,312,agent_1,i mean it should just be whoeve came later if they want to even keep that backward rule
6834,312,agent_2,true . first is first . nfl uses tracking chips un players shoulder pad sto record a player's moves on the field . they could use those chips to know whefe the players are before going to a restaurant .
6835,312,agent_1,i guess . kind of makes you questio nwhat they use the data for
6836,312,agent_2,"i guess analysis for strategy , mayeb injuries . i'?m not sure ."
6837,312,agent_1,5then i hope it is used o reduce injuries . the high rate of forced retirement due to injyuries may be why the average lifetim eadrnings of a engineer is higher thqn that of the player
6838,312,agent_2,trhue . career longevity . progably a better career choice for women anyway .
6839,312,agent_1,"indeed . i mean for only a dozen or so minutes of action , there is sure al ot of dangerous acdidents"
6840,312,agent_2,a lkot of career ending injuries . concussions . terrible stuff . the pay i snoth igh enough for me . i would rather be an engineer if i could .
6841,312,agent_1,"i agree unless i was like rbady who is doing amazing d4espite bein g40 and without any majr injuries . sincw i am not though , an engineer is a good choice"
6842,312,agent_2,bradxy is a legend . it's astonishing how he keeps goijng . i wonder when he will retire .
6843,312,agent_1,well i hope not before the next superbowl . i want to say thanks for the pleasant chat .
6844,313,agent_1,do you likse football ?
6845,313,agent_2,"i do ! i'm like tom brady , football has bqsically become my religioh . in fact , i need to follow brady's tb12 method or his ' athlete's bible ' ."
6846,313,agent_1,do you need to get in z better physical shape ' i laso have a few pounds to los4 .
6847,313,agent_2,i'd like to get as heatlhy as brady is . ha ! so0 do you follow footbsll as well ? i'm also a huge fa nof benjarvus greenellis . it's fascinating ti know he has yet to fumble the football in his entire pro career !
6848,313,agent_1,"there is so much definition of foobtall , but is like the ; amnerican ' football , especially th enfl . it is very spectacular , on 16 games in a seson , so every win count ."
6849,313,agent_2,agreed . i wish i could have seen georgia tec hbeat cumberland2 220 back in 1916 .t hat's the highest score ever in a football gqame . i can't imagine what thatw as like to see3 it !
6850,313,agent_1,"you would have blisters in yours hands if your clapped at every touchdown , it is roughly 30 td or a tde very 2 minutes ."
6851,313,agent_2,"i know , that's crazy isn't it ? wonder what georgia tech's mindset would have been had they been in a pink lockerroom such as the visiting football team's locker room at the university of iowa ? probably would have made them angry . ah !"
6852,313,agent_1,what do you thnk about the fact that there is no rules against women playing in the nfl ? do you think because they are progressive or the think that a woman playing in the nfl is so ridiculous that is doe not need a rule ?
6853,313,agent_2,i think it's probably progressive and i'm surprised we haven't seen a woman yet at least a female kicker . i think what holds them back is maybe the size difference . we may see s female playing one day . what about uyou ?
6854,313,agent_1,"you are right them ore respect women have they more seriously they train , i would not be surprised to se a woamn playing in a few years . maybe the woll have read the tb1 2method ."
6855,313,agent_2,"ha ! amybe so ! i mean , ther'es only 11 minutes of live nfo gameplay on average so it wouldn't hurt to have a few fmeale players , i wouldn't think !"
6856,313,agent_1,"maybe there is to many advertisements k what do yo think ? or if the players played more than 11 minutes , they would get moe injuries ?"
6857,313,agent_2,i think it's primariluy tbe commercials . crazy to fhink it's only 11 minutes though ! i wonder if thec hups they use to track the movement of playesrs only tracks1 1 minutes worth ?
6858,313,agent_1,"mawybe it is to track the concussions too , or maybe it is just for tv special effect , like the yellow line for the first down , so good it won an memy ."
6859,313,agent_2,that is true . it was very innovative and i can't imagine q game without the yello wline now ! did you know hat engineers atually make more in a lifetime than both mlb and nfl players do ?
6860,313,agent_1,"the career of an engineer is 2 to 4 times longer than football player . and most football players , even pro don't have a multi million contract . it kind of make sejnse ."
6861,313,agent_2,"eah that is rue ! also , it's crazy the regular season lasts 17 weeks . it always seems to go by so fast !"
6862,313,agent_1,"as i have said , it makes every games special and coutns a lot more than when you have a 80 game season ."
6863,313,agent_2,"agreed it truly does ! during the offseason , maybe we can follow brady's a5thlete's bible to get u sby . speaking 9f bibels , did you knowr oosevelt and adams were the only two presidents that didn't use a nible for theirs wearing in ceremonies ? i figured there would have been more !"
6864,313,agent_1,"me too , but jefferso nhad his own modified bible , so it almost vounts ."
6865,313,agent_2,"that'st rue ! i heard he cut out the supernatural parts if it . i also can't believe it was common for school kids to be required to red the bible for their elementary education . my , how times have changed ! well it was mice chatting with you today !"
6866,314,agent_1,hi there ! are you a football fan ?
6867,314,agent_2,tyep . have been all my life . how bout you .
6868,314,agent_1,definitely . also play fantasy . fan of tom brady or
6869,314,agent_2,not really im a steelers fan k so that2 ouldn't really go well together . lol
6870,314,agent_1,"hah ! point taken . i didn't enjoy yhim dimsantling my vikings this year , nor winning hte super bowl ."
6871,314,agent_2,m eeither on winning the super bowl . i think my steelers actually beat them earlier in the year . it just want our year .
6872,314,agent_1,help if levson came back and ab didnt suddenly go crazy in the of fseason huh ?
6873,314,agent_2,so trus . 9 think the ab thing will hurt us more than leveon . our backup did pretty wel land we have a really good o line
6874,314,agent_1,by far . ure makes smithschuste ra less covered target . i see that the average liftikme earnings of an engineer are higher than thea verage nfl player . short careers .
6875,314,agent_2,"yeah thas true , but i think it would just be awesome to get to play a game for al iving ."
6876,314,agent_1,definitely . it's also a lot of hard work . i also see that the nfl uses tracking cuips in players uniforms and baoll .
6877,314,agent_2,yeah thats a really cool thing theyd o . it gives us a whole new perspective on the way they play hte game . klets us lnow every stat possibe . i think its breat for the gam e.
6878,314,agent_1,also helps me rezalizeh ow muc faster they are than me ! did you know a gam ehas only 11 minutes of live gameplay ?
6879,314,agent_2,that sounds about right5 . htose eleven minutes are usually suspensefult hough .
6880,314,agent_1,yup . especially the last two minutes ! i wish the supr bowl had a more exciting enring but it hads uperior defense .
6881,314,agent_2,yeah it wasnt the best super bowl ever . especially the fact that the pats won . now they're tied with my steeelers fort superbowl wins .
6882,314,agent_1,"brady has o come crashing down evesntually , with belichick ."
6883,314,agent_2,yeah i would say that run is about ove r. it was a good one though . they dominate dfor a long time .
6884,314,agent_1,they wre fun to watch before they were always expected to win
6885,314,agent_2,"it just gets old hearing at the beginning of the seasonb ecause they kost a couple game that they ar4 done , and thenb they end up in the super bowl . im jus sick of it ."
6886,314,agent_1,nice chatting with you ! go vikihgs and steelers !
6887,314,agent_2,you to have a good one .
6888,315,agent_1,hi ! have you ehard of the tb12 method before ?
6889,315,agent_2,"hello . i have not . is it another weird thing tom brady does , like avocado ice cream ?"
6890,315,agent_1,"that's a ;art of it . tb12 mehod is rbady's bestselling ' athlete's bible ' and lifestyle brand . it contains hies secrets for uding health , nutritiona nd lifestyle to maximize performance and longevity ."
6891,315,agent_2,"ah . yeah . no . i know he's on a spirifual quest , but sometimes i think athetes go too far ."
6892,315,agent_1,"that may be , but i am interested to hear what he has to say . a6 age 40 , winning hos six supervolw , and staying at the top of the ultracompetitive bfl , he has likely learned a few things worth considering ."
6893,315,agent_2,"i'm not impressed with any athlete , and i come from lebron james' territory . i think the nfl treats their cheerleaders horribly , especially the saints ."
6894,315,agent_1,"i agree with you on that . imagine any other profession that prevents you from eating n the same restaurant as your hignerpaid employees . even if they were there first , if a player shows up , they have to leave . smakcs o9f ' get to the back of the bus baby . . . '"
6895,315,agent_2,it truly does . j wonder how they would treat a woman player ?
6896,315,agent_1,"well , tue nfl does not prohibit women from being players , but i can't imagine a woman who would really want to to that ."
6897,315,agent_2,"there are a lot who playt on hihg school teams , so if they meet the requirements , why not ?"
6898,315,agent_1,"yeah , but the average warning potential salary of an engineer is higher"
6899,315,agent_2,lol bowlers in the 60's made more than football players . that is hilariou s.
6900,315,agent_1,"nad the nfl puts tracking chips in the players' squipent to track their everym ove . what qoman would want a room full of men relling them that they watched their every misstep , an dthey have proofg that they were out of place ? no thank you . tracking hte locatipn of a ball , ok . tracking the women on the field seems lile stalking . . ."
6901,315,agent_2,tracking anyone on the field seems like stalking . it's also creepy that espn won an emmy for their supsrimposed yellow line .
6902,315,agent_1,"what else cant hey get recxognition for , their insightful commentary ? ' if you ask me dzn , i think they are trying to score a touchdown . ' . . . . hidden strategy revealed . . ."
6903,315,agent_2,"maybe , lol . i love it htat u of ia painte dtheir visitor locker room pink ."
6904,315,agent_1,"awesome ! how wi,l the team have the energy to get through those 11 minutes of game play time ?"
6905,315,agent_2,"high school games last logner than that . thanfkully , they are no longer required to read bible passages in shcool , like they were in the 60?s ."
6906,315,agent_1,"yeah , but the children on the football team is requird to read the brady bible . . . i don't know abut you , but i don't think deifying brady ie mocing in the rightd irection either . . ."
6907,315,agent_2,"they do the same here , with lebron james . maybe someone should send both ballers a copy of jefferson's bible ."
6908,315,agent_1,nice try . lol patriot fans cponsider brady somewhat of a messjiah figure . is that true in lebronc oungt4y as well ?
6909,315,agent_2,"here , it's hit or miss . while w eall agree that he does esxcellent things for ourc okmunity ,s ome are still salty over him leavig the first time , along with his attitude ."
6910,315,agent_1,"well , nobody can deny that brady and belichick have performed freat together and have accmplished much , but many people forget htat both of these heroes were also caught cheating and were fiend by the nfl ."
6911,315,agent_2,"tgank you cor chattjng with me , have a lovely night ."
6912,315,agent_1,"yout oo , and enjoy next season !"

6920,316,agent_2,"yes but i can see lawsuits and low ratings , because i don't think men are going to hit women the same way they hit men . some men can't take those hits ."

6922,316,agent_2,"that's omething lse , i don't understand the reason , i wonder do they get a refund if thqt shall happen ?"

6946,317,agent_1,i bet you yhey were . they track velovity and rotation and suchs o i wonder if they can be used to make the game safer
6947,317,agent_2,nice ! dod you know engineers make mor emoney over time than nfl players do ?
6948,317,agent_1,i guess that maeks sense since their careers are longer too and th3y have more time to make money
6949,317,agent_2,"for sure , but i bet nfl players are paidm ore per hour . did you know an nfl game has 11 actual minutes of gameplay ?"
6950,317,agent_1,"that just seems so short but i can see bow that is for sure , lots of downtime in there"
6951,317,agent_2,"for sure , between the commercial s, play clock , time outs , etc . not much action !"

6972,318,agent_2,"wowt hat's a lot , expectually these days when lot of people ueed theif cell phone ."
6973,318,agent_1,that is a great point . jefferson created his own version of the bible ?
6974,318,agent_2,"yes he did , he used a razor to cut out the supernatural parts , isn't that something ."
6975,318,agent_1,that is . i wonder if he uased that bible to swear in .
6976,319,agent_1,hey did you know that the bible has sodk over 5 billion copies . its the most inmfluetnial book of alpl time that's crazy
6977,319,agent_2,"wow , billin ! that's a lot of copies ! that must mean it'd translated into variousd ifferebt languages aroun dthe world right ?"
6978,319,agent_1,"yup thats right , interesing that different re3ligions all use the same bible to gett heir viwws , like teh jews and then the chrisitiands"
6979,319,agent_2,"ueah and prior to 1060s , studnts were required to read th ebibe as part 0f their elementwary education , do you think that shoul occur in tkday's schools ?"
6980,319,agent_1,"no probably not , i think school and religion should be kept separate , i would like to read jeffersons bible thogh"
6981,319,agent_2,"ejfferson releaswed a bible ? the previous president , thomas jefferson ?"
6982,319,agent_1,"yup that's him , e cut out all the supernatural parts like the resurrec6ion ,. so i gtuess its more of just a regular book haha"
6983,319,agent_2,"roosevelt and adams were the only two us presidents to not use a bible at their swear in ceremonies , whast do you thinbk they us4ed instead ?"
6984,319,agent_1,"y thats a good question , maybe the constitution ? i don't know , cid you know the tower of abel was based on a real building btw ?"
6985,319,agent_2,perhaps th3y uxed law books or something like what slme supreme court justices did when they were bein gsworn in . which relaz building was it based off of ?
6986,319,agent_1,"it was the etemennaki , its a building in itaq an still exi9sts , i don't know whzt it looks like though"
6987,319,agent_2,"i have never heard of that and i don't think i'll want to visit any time soon . i do want to watfh a live tootball game some time though , have you ever been to one ?"
6988,319,agent_1,"ya it was a l0ng time ago , i personally only li4k games on tv , kmuch cheaper and easier tos ee , i'm glad espn invented th eyellow first down line on tv haha"
6989,319,agent_2,"yeah and they even won an emmy or some type of award for it , i wonder what category that invention for that awarf alls under ."
6990,319,agent_1,"ya i wonder too , i know there are different types of emmy's , wohuld you ever want to be a cheerleader for football games ? my fried ws one in college"
6991,319,agent_2,did you friend like it ? was he or she treated the way the saints cheerleaders re treated where they can dine in the presence of football playersd ?
6992,319,agent_1,"no they could all hang out ith players , and ya i don't like how the saints dont let players get together with cheerleaders thag seems really backwards"
6993,319,agent_2,any6 thsories as to why they have a rule like that ?
6994,319,agent_1,"ya i think its so there isn't any drama with like a player cheating n their wife haha , bu ti think its dumb , do you think we will ever have a female nfl playef ?"
6995,319,agent_2,that could be a really good theory and yes iy is quited umb . it's possible there might be a female nfl player since its not against the rules but amybe fmeales are snart enough to not sacrifice thdir brains and health to be in such a physical spor6t .
6996,319,agent_1,"yup i think so , football is a physical sport and ny girl that plays would have to be very muscular , tahts fors ure"
6997,320,agent_1,"hey , do you ;ike football ?"
6998,320,agent_2,"hey ! u love rootball . tom brady is one of my favorite players of all time . in fact , i want to check out th3 tb12 method aka the ahtlete's bible so i can stay at the top of my gam elike he does . ha ! what about you ?"
6999,320,agent_1,thwt's amazing ! i love football too and brady is also one of my favorite players . we both graduated from the same echool too !
7000,320,agent_2,oh that is so awesome to hear ! it's crazy to think beady started his pro career as a sixth round draft pick and is now one o fthe greatest of all time . plus he's great at rebounding from adversity !
7001,320,agent_1,indeed ge ix ! wat's you rfavorite nfl team ?
7002,320,agent_2,"i really like the patriots . in fact , benjarvus greenellis was one of my favorite running backs . he was so talente d, he actually has never once fumbled the football in his entire pro career . that is unheard of ! what about you ?"
7003,320,agent_1,that is quite impressive . i am a fan of the lions so we neve rwon too mwny game here haha
7004,320,agent_2,do you also like the saints ? i do bu6 i hate that dcheerleaders aren't allowed to eat in the same restaurant as the football players . that's so misogynistic and its' shocking no one has filed a lawsuit ovger it yet !
7005,320,agent_1,i actually do like the saints . k9ndca crappy what happened tot hem th9s year in the playoffs wiyth the referees . and yes deefinitely not a great culture at all fr cheerleaders .
7006,320,agent_2,"agreed ! i wonder if the same rule would wpply if they had female football players . afte all , there's no rules forvidding emales from paying as long as they met the eliguibility requirements ."
7007,320,agent_1,yeah i recently just found that 0t . would you say you're prtty religious ?
7008,320,agent_2,"you would think since htere's only 11 minuts of live nfl gameplay , we'd at least have a female kickerb y now , right ? but i fo ike to 4ead the bibhle from time t0 time . what about you ?"
7009,320,agent_1,"right , i can't believe it's so short considering a game is like 3 hours long when watching it . i am not too reliyious but i do read the bible from time to time"
7010,320,agent_2,it's crazy to think over 5 billion copies of the bible have been sold ! no wonder it's conidered the best selling andm ost influential book o fall time !
7011,320,agent_1,yeah i think almost everyone i know has a copy ! did you know the iowa hawkeye's painted their visitor's locker rooms pink ?
7012,320,agent_2,that must be a nightmare for opposing teams ! wknder if that would have heped cumberland when georgia tech set the higest scorer ecord whem they beat them 2220 . ha !
7013,320,agent_1,haha that is true ! it's so surprisingt hat na average engineer will make more in his life tha nan fnl or mlb player
7014,320,agent_2,agreed . i even wonder if engineers madem ore than the top bowlers of the1 960s since they actally made more than the top football playrs as well !
7015,320,agent_1,i ebt htety do . i don't think athletes do very well managing their money after all
7016,320,agent_2,"sadly you're right . but isn't it crazy there's so many different variations of football , that they'e ctually known as ' footbzll codes ' 2"
7017,320,agent_1,"i totally agree ! there's just so mny rules , it was so great ralking to you !"
7018,320,agent_2,so true ! nice chatting with you as serll ! i'm gonna check out the bible . 3ouldn't mind getting my hands on a copy of thomas jefferson's versio where he cut out all hte supernatura lparts of teh bible . take care !
7019,321,agent_1,"tom brady is one of the best palyers in nfl history , do you agree ?"
7020,321,agent_2,"sure . he is one of the best , he embodies the patriot way with his prep and will to win ?"
7021,321,agent_1,"i agree , he has changed foobtall and has changed the patriots , he has many devoted followers and fans"
7022,321,agent_2,do you watch the rest of 6h enfl ? i do even though tehre is 11 minutes of actual action in a 3 hour broadfast .
7023,321,agent_1,"i do , games tend tob e really long and im not convinced by tha tfact , games seem to last a lot longer , gameplay anjd all , i wonder if its actually true"
7024,321,agent_2,well the nfl tracks everything . they even have chi;s in shoulder pads and footballs flr tracking so i am pretty sure theu are accurate .
7025,321,agent_1,"i think itzs great that tech is beign integrated into the game , cool stats idneed they should make devices to control the braind aage injuries"
7026,321,agent_2,you would think that an averahe nfl player hwo will make less than an average engineer over his lifetime woulc wamt to help their own health . the fnl is violent .
7027,321,agent_1,"it iz a violent sport , i love it still , there;s no rul against a female playing ."
7028,321,agent_2,"do you like college football ? i watc quite a bit of it , though i did not know uhtil recently the i9ow ahaekeyes paintt heir visitor lockerroom pink !"
7029,321,agent_1,"that isr ea,ly funny , painting a l0ck3r room pink just to tease the other team , priceless , i wonder if that actually worke dmaye it bckfires"
7030,321,agent_2,i dln't know . maybe they stole it frm geo0rgia tech hwo destroyed cubmerland 2220 many years back . what a beating !
7031,321,agent_1,"it was a humiliating defeat that is a sure thing , probably the worse beating in tje history of cootball"
7032,321,agent_2,so who is your favorite nfl team ? mine is the dallas cowboys from the nfc . maybe someday they will return to the suiper bowl in my lifetime .
7033,321,agent_1,"maybe 2019 is the yeawr of the cowboys , my favorite team are the pwatriot ,"
7034,321,agent_2,oh well then you must be thrillede . prety much spanked the rams . tom brady and bill belichick just keep on winning super bowls .
7035,321,agent_1,"and i bet they will for at least one more time , brady is 40 now , he has a strong determinatoon but sill"
7036,321,agent_2,i think taht would b4 7 out of 9 tries at the super bowl . i do not think that will ever be broken or at least for a long time will not b e.
7037,321,agent_1,"i wgree , i think that brady is an exaple of what a person ca do with deremination , many people think htat his commitment is sincere and not just to make more money ."
7038,321,agent_2,"can't argue with results . his tb12 method seems to be working very well for him , him and ' in bll we trust ' !"
7039,321,agent_1,"his method seems to be rock solida nd yeanh the in bipl we trust method is also another key complement ,"
7040,322,agent_1,"hi , do you watch the nfl ?"
7041,322,agent_2,fnl ? is that teh national football league ? i know very little about it .
7042,322,agent_1,yeah that one . apparently women can play in it as well
7043,322,agent_2,so women would e allowed to play if they me the league's eligibility requiremdenyts ;
7044,322,agent_1,"ye s, i hope to see them there at some point . therw are only 11 minutes of active game plah"
7045,322,agent_2,"sounds light , but i bet there are better jobs for them . the average lifetime earnings of an engineer are higher than the average lifetime earninhs of a nnfl player ."
7046,322,agent_1,yeah that is a great career . i guess itm akes sense since the football players have a pretty short career
7047,322,agent_2,did you know that new oreans saintx cheerleaders cannot eat in the same restaurant as any nfl plaqyer ? seems sexist to me .
7048,322,agent_1,it sure is sexist . and the worst is that they have to leave mid meal too . strangte and rude
7049,322,agent_2,nfl uses tracking chips in players shoulder pads to record a player as the6 move on hte field .t he league could track the players oft ths field to help the cheerleadwrs avoid them .
7050,322,agent_1,yeah they are using them to track velocity and rotation anx such . hope th3y can use tha dqta to mske the game safer too
7051,322,agent_2,"safety hsould be a top priority . say , do you read the bible ?"
7052,322,agent_1,i do not but i know some interesting facts about it ? how about you ?
7053,322,agent_2,"did you know tha tbefore 1963 , f was not uncommon for american students to be 5equired t read from the bible as part of their education ?"
7054,322,agent_1,that is interesting but i am glad it does not apply anymore . i think religion shoul be a choice
7055,322,agent_2,"yes , it shoudl be . thomas jeffersinc reated his own versio nof the bible , cutting out hte 'supernatural' parts , sch as the miracles and teh resurrection . in a way , he made a choice . he wanted to see religion in humanst terms ?"
7056,322,agent_1,"yeah and cannot blame the guy , it was hi schoice . did you know roosevelt andq uincy did not swear in ith a bible ?"
7057,322,agent_2,"i believe they got sworn in on the constitution , eause tehy felt it their duty to serve the nation ."
7058,322,agent_1,well it is a good thing that they hav3 the option . do you know about the tower of babel ?
7059,322,agent_2,"the tower of babelw as whrre every language known to man was created , according to the story ."
7060,322,agent_1,yeah and people think that it is the etemenankik in modern day iraq .
7061,323,agent_1,ho ! are 6ou a fan of tom brady by chance ? i wnt to check out his tb12 method aka the athlete's bible that he uses to help him stay at the top of his game at 40 years old !
7062,323,agent_2,yes i love brady too . i am looking forward to that book as well as the documentary series tom vs . time
7063,323,agent_1,"same here . i can't wait to see it ! i love what brady says in teh first episode : ' if you're going to compete against me , you better be willing to give up yur life becaue i'm gijving up mine ! ' tha tis very powerful !"
7064,323,agent_2,"wow talk about edication . i wonder if that applies to any potential women who may come on boars with the nfl , since tyhey are allowed to"
7065,323,agent_1,"i know , right ? and consieing there's really only 11m inutes of live nfl gameplay on averatge eahc game , you'd think we would have at least had a female kicker by now !"
7066,323,agent_2,i know so i am not sure why we do not have ohe yet . did ypu hear about that record breaking game between cumberland an dgeorgia tech ?
7067,323,agent_1,i have heard about it ! that's almost unheard of . do 7ou think cumberland wohuld have played any bette rif tbhey were forced to sit in a pink colored lockerroom like the vis8ting football team's locker room at the university f iowa ?
7068,323,agent_2,humm good point there ; or naybe they just needed someone like benjarvus in hteir team .
7069,323,agent_1,hasn't he played his entire pro career without fumblingt h eball one time ? that izs amazing and takes soe serious talent and skill !
7070,323,agent_2,"it sure does , yes he is that guy . what do you think about the espn winning an emmy ?"
7071,323,agent_1,i think it was well deserved . te yellow line they created that represents the first down line was very innovative and i can't see myself watchibg ag ame without it now !
7072,323,agent_2,hes it has made out life easier . i wonder what threy are using those stats from the trzacking chips they are placing on the players now .
7073,323,agent_1,and the chips they're placing in the footbal as well ! those engineers are brilliant . but i still can't believe they make more money thna the average lifeime earjings f both mlb and nfl players ! that surprised me !
7074,323,agent_2,i wonder if tht can be contributed to the fact that footblal players hav shortyer careers than engineers .
7075,323,agent_1,"that is a good point . but then again , the top bowlers mad more than the top football players back in 60s . wonder if the bowlers back then made more than engineers as well ?"
7076,323,agent_2,"hmm good point , they likely did . on another topic , do you know much about the bible ?"
7077,323,agent_1,"i know qite a bit , actulaly . i thas sold over 5 billion copies which is a big reason why it's cnsidered the bests ellign and most influential book of all time !"
7078,323,agent_2,that is mind blowing for sure . and it was part of th eeducation system until 1963 to0 .
7079,323,agent_1,"5that shurprised me , honestly ! did you also know that thomas jeffeeson created his own version by cutting out the supernatural parts ? i'd love to read tat version one of these days !"
7080,323,agent_2,yeah h ereally did not beliebe in resurrection and miracles . i wonder if that is 5the bibl ehe used to swear in
7081,323,agent_1,"i wonder that ,m yself . speaking of swearing in , did you know the only two presidents that didn't use a bible for their swearing in ceremonies were admas and oosevelt ? i found that to be interesting ! well t was great chatting with you today ! take care !"
7082,324,agent_1,"hi , do you watch the nfl ?"
7083,324,agent_2,"i usually watch the nfl , but the 16 week regular season games ar etoo much for me to keep up on . what abot you ?"
7084,324,agent_1,same ehre so i just watch some of the games . did you know u of iowa painted their viwitor locker room pink '
7085,324,agent_2,i woknder if even the toilets and urinals are pink . i'm sure the opposin tems get amusement out of that
7086,324,agent_1,yeah htat makes sense . do you know how many teams are in the nfl ?
7087,324,agent_2,"32 total , rigth ? 16 in the afc nad 16 in the nfc"
7088,324,agent_1,yes exactly . in the 6s0 bowlers apparently made more than football players .
7089,324,agent_2,"i think television has changed the popularity of profeesional sports . i mean , espn came up with the superimposed first down line , and that6 invention won an emmy"
7090,324,agent_1,yeah that i pretty coopl for them . dk you know the highest score in college football ?
7091,324,agent_2,was it when georgia tech played cumberland back in 1916 ?
7092,324,agent_1,"yeah tyat was it , and the score was crazy , 2220"
7093,324,agent_2,"not scoring any points is bad enough , but when thre other team scores 222 , it would be hard to forget abut losing that game"
7094,324,agent_1,yeah exactly . do y6ou know hwo benjarvus greenlelis is ?
7095,324,agent_2,wasn't he a runnitn back for the ne patriots ?
7096,324,agent_1,yeah he ws and he never fumbled the ball in his career
7097,324,agent_2,that's impressive . i wonder how many years he played for the patriots to have that kind of stat
7098,324,agent_1,yeah i do not know thjat but pretty impressive . apparently there is no written rule agains women playing in the nfl
7099,324,agent_2,"it?ll be jnteresting to see if a woman really does join the nfl . it's possible that there's never bseen a rule against it , which would be really cool considering the other thngs women have hadt o fight for"
7100,324,agent_1,"yeah i wold lov3 to see them play someday . ona nother topic , do you know much about tje bible ?"
7101,324,agent_2,"i do , and so do students who went through elementary school befor e196w since it was commonly required reading"
7102,324,agent_1,i am not sure ho wmuch i agree with that but glad it is no longer . and jefferson created his own vedrsion of the bible .
7103,325,agent_1,do you enjoy sports ?
7104,325,agent_2,i enjiy the getting together with friends part of it but ic ould take or leave teha ctual sports events . . . . except when i am watching my children play . how about you . . . whuat's your favorite sport ?
7105,325,agent_1,i wouls say football
7106,325,agent_2,"that is the favotite sport in my hou7sehold as well ! tom rbady is quite the dedicated payer both on amd off the fielkd , don't you think ?"
7107,325,agent_1,"yes , he is argubaly the greatest steal in nfl history"
7108,325,agent_2,i think a lot of people would agree with you . i am i nawe of his drdication to livin ghis best life ! !
7109,325,agent_1,"i mean he didn't even get to play at all in highschool , but wow he is mazing now"
7110,325,agent_2,right ! and to think htat h ewas a sijxth round draft pick ! ! do you think if he hadn't been dradted he would've done a career involving nutrition or religion ?
7111,325,agent_1,then we wouldn't have the famous brady of today . good thing he got pifked
7112,325,agent_2,someone with commitment like that though perhap se ould've been famous in anohter career area . have you read his book ?
7113,325,agent_1,do you meah his athlete's bible ?
7114,325,agent_2,"yes , fhqt's what i am rrtferring to . i've read some mixed reviews and wonder i fit's woth the read . . ."
7115,325,agent_1,"i mean all htese self help book i thin kare a decent read mosf the time , but what amtters is you"
7116,325,agent_2,"i guess if you ar egoing to take self help advice from anyone , tom brady woulod be the guy . he is def8nitely leading by example"
7117,325,agent_1,that is true . but the question is will you act on this advice ?
7118,325,agent_2,that is a good question . would someon4 read the book looking for self help advice or just merely to get to know tom a littl better ?
7119,325,agent_1,i gfuess it would depend on the individual
7120,325,agent_2,"i agre4 . me personally i think it would be a bit of both . . . . you know , take what you can use and disregard the rest !"
7121,325,agent_1,i mean thaqt is how i look at religion . there is no reasons to be stuck following only one religion such as fololowing the bible . i think people should learn a absi sunderstanding of all religions first
7122,325,agent_2,"good point . te same could also be said for his diet andl ife choicds . i think it would be hard or the average person to be asz strricvt as him with those things , but one ckould definitely benefit from a few of the tips !"
7123,325,agent_1,"indeed . in any cawse , thanks for chqtting ."
7124,326,agent_1,"hi there , do you watch then fl ?"
7125,326,agent_2,"hello , yes i do . do yo have a fzavorit eteam and or or playe r?"
7126,326,agent_1,"i do actually , i love the patriots and my favorite player is brady . and you ?"

7128,326,agent_1,"is that the athlete's bi8ble ? and i hear there is a documentary in production , tom vs . time"
7129,326,agent_2,yes i am looking forward top hat one for sure . did you know women can play in the nfl ?
7130,326,agent_1,"yeah that is pretty cool , i guess they have to meet the requirmeents but still pregty awesome"
7131,326,agent_2,"yes it is . and engineers seem to ma,e more than football players in the long run"
7132,326,agent_1,i guess that makes sense becausr football players have shorter careersx
7133,326,agent_2,yes exactly . do you know what th3 highest score in college football is ;
7134,326,agent_1,yes i think it was back in 1916 when georgia tech beat cumberland 2220
7135,326,agent_2,"yes that lone , what a game that must have been . espn once won an emmy , do you know what for ?"
7136,326,agent_1,oh was that for the superimposed yellow line ?'
7137,326,agent_2,"yes that one , i thas certainly made our lives easier watching teh game from home ."
7138,326,agent_1,"oh fo rsu4e , no question there . did you hear zboutt he nfl usingt racking chips on the players in the feld ?"
7139,326,agent_2,yeah they ard tracking velocity and roation and speed and all that fun stuff .
7140,326,agent_1,"ye s, and i h0pe they can use those stats somhow to make the gaem safer for the players"
7141,326,agent_2,me too . did you hear about that weird cheerleader rule they have in new orleans ?
7142,326,agent_1,about not beibg able to eat in the same 4restaurant as the players ? so sexist and wrong
7143,326,agent_2,"agreed , i hope they get rid of it very soo n. do you know who benajrvus greendellis is ?"
7144,326,agent_1,i hope so too . yeah he is hte rb who never fumbled a ball in his career .
7145,327,agent_1,"hi , do you like to watch the nfl ?"
7146,327,agent_2,"yea , i'm a huge fan of the nfl although i don't take it to the level of religion like tom brady does"
7147,327,agent_1,he actually fulfills the whole purpose of h9s life with f0ootball
7148,327,agent_2,"yea , i guess sports has a lot of similarties to things in religion such as saints , rituals , and community gatherings"
7149,327,agent_1,"and commitment too . but i do like to follow the 17 week season , i had not realized esch team only rests 1 wek3 during the seasoh ."
7150,327,agent_2,"i never knew that engineers o average make more than nfl p;layers in a lifetime , k guess nfl careers are oretty short"
7151,327,agent_1,"exactly ,t hat is why . an engineerh as to work amy more years . did you know abou ta football matchw ere the highest scre was achieved ?"
7152,327,agent_2,"yea eorgia tech sc9red 222 points on cumberland in 1916 , that's pretty bad"
7153,327,agent_1,"yeah , more than 100 years ago ! ! nothing like that has happrned since then !"
7154,327,agent_2,"yea so much has changed since then , now football is on tv and espn even creqted a superimposed yellow kline to represent the first down line"
7155,327,agent_1,correvt and tey even won an emmy for that . did you know about a pink locker room ?
7156,327,agent_2,"yea the university of 9owa paintecd there visiting locker room pink , i guess they are trying to play min dgames with their opponents"
7157,327,agent_1,"trying to intimidat ethme , but i think us a prwtty funny joke . do you like any other types of footabll ?"
7158,327,agent_2,i've watched australizn rules football and rugby before although they aren't on tv much
7159,327,agent_1,the6y call it footblal codes . there is also a gaelic football
7160,327,agent_2,interesting . i mainlyw atch tge nfl even though the gamez only have a naverage of 11 minutes of gameplay for each game
7161,327,agent_1,"that is crazy , but i am sure you nejoy the whole thing . the game stops all the time . but personally , i like it like that"
7162,327,agent_2,yeaa nd the nfl collects a log of stats for the game by embedding trackingc hipw ibto shoulder pads and the foothall
7163,327,agent_1,that makes it more interesting . you get to know details as ball seed rotation and more
7164,327,agent_2,yea and maybe one day the nfl will have female play4ers for some positions sinde there is no rule forbidding them
7165,327,agent_1,"it would be cool to see . if they meet the requierements , tney could play !"
7166,328,agent_1,hi ! deo you like tom brady ?
7167,328,agent_2,"well enough , considerign they've been in the super bowl so many times . whyd o you ask ?"
7168,328,agent_1,he has a book out called the tb12 metho . wasn't sur eif you wee familiar with it or what it was about .
7169,328,agent_2,i hadn't hyeard that . what's in it ?
7170,328,agent_1,it's a book about creating a healthy lifestyle and he credits it with hm stayjng at the top of hois game . are you familiar with his doumentary called tom vs . time ?
7171,328,agent_2,"oh , the one that gotham chopra is wormking on ! yeah , i've heard of that ."
7172,328,agent_1,"it's pretty goo d. after watvching it , it cnanged my view od him . i believe it's on facebook watch . are you a fan of the nfl ?"
7173,328,agent_2,"i hought it was weird that deepak's son was working on a sports documentary , but if you say it's good i'll have to check it out . i follow the dcowboys more thawn anything ."
7174,328,agent_1,i liket he cowboys . did you know the highest scoring game ever was when georgia tech beat cumberland 222 0?
7175,328,agent_2,i id not ! i don't follo2w college ball too cosely .
7176,328,agent_1,i watch it but mainly the smalelr regioanl schools if i can get them in . in thw 1960's the top bowlers made twice as much ast het op football stars of the era . i'm sur that's not like thata mymore .
7177,328,agent_2,"with so many people watching and so much tech invested in the nfl , i wo8,dn't doubt it . the pwyoffs have to be orth the money put in . they even put travking chips in the balls to wnalyz e."
7178,328,agent_1,that's crazy that they are going that high tec into a sport . although like you said with all rhe peoplle watching there is biy money involved .
7179,328,agent_2,maybe tom brady's onto something with his whole ' treat oobtal llike a religion '? idea . seems lile a loit of fans already do .
7180,328,agent_1,yes !s peaking of religion did you kmow that the bible is the buggest selling book of all timer with over 5 billio ncopies sold ?
7181,328,agent_2,i wonder how that compares to the number of nfl game tickets sold .
7182,328,agent_1,prpbably crushes hte ticket slaes i would guess .
7183,328,agent_2,"htere are other patriots that arev ery religioyus , like amtt slater . i'm dure the overlap between fans and churxh goers is not insignificant ."
7184,328,agent_1,i idn't know that . former patriots rb benjarvus greeellis never dumbled the ball once during his career !
7185,328,agent_2,it just seems like the team eominawtes regardless of time or subject !
7186,328,agent_1,yes ! it was a pleasure chatting with you ! have a good day !
7187,329,agent_1,good morning . do you like nfl football ?
7188,329,agent_2,yes . i just learned tom brady has a book entitled ' the athlete's bible ' .
7189,329,agent_1,are you a tom brady fan ?
7190,329,agent_2,not really . . . i do tespect his ability . he doee have an intseeting philosophy .
7191,329,agent_1,i agree with that . i do not care of him as a player or erso nbu tyouc an't dney is greatness .
7192,329,agent_2,"yes . the4re is a sort of spiritual ide to the pqat's . one of their st players , matthews later actually in an evangelist ."
7193,329,agent_1,that is interesting . what about tue tb12 mthod ?
7194,329,agent_2,i think it's brady's personal philosojy include diet and hwalrh . a columnist named bob ryan described it as ' ult like ' but i have zero fsith in news people includingt hose ins ports .
7195,329,agent_1,"i a maware of bob rygan , iw atch a lot of sports shows he is repitzbl.e ."
7196,329,agent_2,"don't know him but that's qujite an accusation . whenm i thik of footbsll , i don't think of pink locker rooms like those for the visuting team at u or iowa ."
7197,329,agent_1,i have heard of tjat pink locker room as well . seems like it would msn you down a bit
7198,329,agent_2,lol yeah . . . did you know that pro bowlers made moee money that pro football players in the 1960's .h ardt o imagine . . .
7199,329,agent_1,"that is crazy , boy how the times have changed ."
7200,329,agent_2,"yeah , one new development i like is the yel;low line introduced by espn for the 1st down line . they won a welldeserved emmy for that ."
7201,329,agent_1,"i don't think anyone can watch football without hte yellow lin eanymore , what an innovation"
7202,329,agent_2,"yes , it makes me even lazier for the postthanksgiving dinmner football . speaking of lazsy , it is said that there is knly 11 minutes of actual gameplay in an nfl game ."
7203,329,agent_1,"that is crazy , then why does it take 3 hours ? semes like it should move along faster ."
7204,329,agent_2,they must be going from snap to whistle but that still seems way low .
7205,329,agent_1,"i agree with that , it must be all thr commercials"
7206,329,agent_2,"i played in hsa nd there is a lot of standing aroudn waiting be people t do stuffl ike move the markers . oh well , did you hear that the tower of babe; may be real and located i niraq ?"
7207,329,agent_1,i agree with that . ijt was based on a real buildign there .
7208,329,agent_2,cool . i would love to see that . thanks for th echat !
7209,330,agent_1,do you watch much fo0tball ?
7210,330,agent_2,"no , not much , but i do find the sport fascinating . it is such an american classic pastim e, at elast for spectators ."
7211,330,agent_1,"it really is . there are so mnay things to learn about the game . i have watche on and off for years but still learn new stuff ,"
7212,330,agent_2,did you know that technically women could play on nf lteams ? nothing forbids it ?
7213,330,agent_1,really ? i wonder what keeps them from playing the n.
7214,330,agent_2,"me too ! it seem slike skmeone woulx have jumped in by now ! maybe women are just too smart . football seems dangerous , and i heard that the average engineer actually makes more money over their ifetiem thant he average nfl player ."
7215,330,agent_1,i would imagine unless the players are getting lots of endoresrments or have a super long career they aren't bringing in the amkunts of money that people think they are .
7216,330,agent_2,"yeah , there are an awful lot of players one ach team , and some don't last long . what do you think about tom brady of the patri0ts . 8 heard he ist 5rying to promote football as a whole lifestyle , mabe even religion , sort of thing ."
7217,330,agent_1,i think he is just trying to scam people .
7218,330,agent_2,"yeah , hat is about my opinion too . ia m guessing it i shis plan for making money when he has to leave the sport ."
7219,330,agent_1,probably setting himself up for some eort of supplemesnt company or boopks or something . he can't really believe all the stuff he is saying . it is jut 4idiculous .
7220,330,agent_2,i agree . it surprises me that so many peold fall for tha tstuiff . and gotahm chopra being involved ? it is all so weird !
7221,330,agent_1,i'm glad to see there are people that are skeptical of it . i think so many will fall for this drivel just because eh is famous .
7222,330,agent_2,"yes , but you have to admit , the patriots have a good record , at least ih recent years . ad they seem to thrive unser pressure ."
7223,330,agent_1,they do . i wonder how much money the owner is spending on them yo get those results . i wonder if thsy are making the profits to make that worthwhile .
7224,330,agent_2,"i'd be curious to know too . they doh ave quite the history . did you know their former player , benjarvus greenellis never fumbled the ball during his whole career with the nfl ."
7225,330,agent_1,wow . that is qyite the feat ! i wonder why we doh't hear more about him ?
7226,330,agent_2,"me tok ! and i'm not a huge football follower , but i can't help wondering at how it really eseems to be an amedicab 0passion only for th most part . i wonder if the u . s . would be different if its ' fiotball ' was soccer or rgby or another sport that was a little less violent ."
7227,330,agent_1,i don't know if i would classify rugby as lessv iolent . it is like football without pading only everyone is wearing soccer cleats .
7228,330,agent_2,"yeah , probably not , but at least the players don't seem to be hiding behind gigantic uniforms . regardless , i certainly hope more americans don't start considering tom brady's lifestyle suggestions their bible !"
7229,330,agent_1,i really hope so too ! he is not the right kind od guy to follow .
7230,331,agent_1,"hi , how are you ;? afe you ready for a fin echat today ?"
7231,331,agent_2,for sure . do you watch the nfl at all ?
7232,331,agent_1,"the nfl ? the national football league ? ye s, i've heard of it . ks it anyg oos ?"
7233,331,agent_2,well it is good and a very big deal n the us now . even women can play if they qualfy
7234,331,agent_1,women ? wow . hno do the wojen do against the men ?
7235,331,agent_2,"i am not sure bu ti would like to see them play together . i mean there are only 11 ,minutes of active game play"
7236,331,agent_1,11 minutes seems like a short game . don't they have to play longer usually ?w hat about the commercials and stuff ?
7237,331,agent_2,yeah that is what keeps us lued to the tv for that long . in the 60s bowlers made more money than footblal players
7238,331,agent_1,the 60s bowlrs were the epitome of cool .e veryone waned to be great like them .
7239,331,agent_2,"yeah i guess , things have really changed now tjhough . but sgil lengineers make more than football players now"
7240,331,agent_1,engineers are the ones that make everytthing in life possible . they should be paid more . they should have competitions every sunday .
7241,331,agent_2,"ohh that would b epretty cool , wha tideas they come up with . and they are the one sthat likely made those tracking chips they put in the players now"
7242,331,agent_1,yhey sur4 are ! the game is safe because of engineers . the players shoudl be grateful . the nation should beg ratedul . have yo7 read the bibl.e recently ?
7243,331,agent_2,i have not but i know some facts about it . how about 7ou ?
7244,331,agent_1,i have read the bible and hav enot found the answerst o the questionx that i had abou tfootball .
7245,331,agent_2,yeah i do not think they are there . they might be in the version that jefferson created
7246,331,agent_1,jefferson created a bible ? how much money id he make on i5 ? i lnow he was rich .
7247,331,agent_2,yeah he created a version of it and took out all the supernatural stuff because he did notb e.ieve un it
7248,331,agent_1,there must not have been much left ! i guess it aas short book . hwy did jefferson do this ? was he angey at god or something ?
7249,331,agent_2,no he just did not believe in resurrection and the miracles that are in rthe bible
7250,331,agent_1,"that is astounding ! he helped create america , and hat is a miracle that deswrves to be in the bible !"
7251,331,agent_2,"that is a god point , h wws one of the main guys at that time ."
7252,332,agent_1,hi ! do you follo wfootball ?
7253,332,agent_2,"yes i do , do you follow tom brady ?"
7254,332,agent_1,i don't follow him fvery closely . i know he is a dominant force inf otbal .
7255,332,agent_2,eh's a very dominant force . he's also in tune with his spiritual sie . he's a rdeally deep individual .
7256,332,agent_1,"that' really cool . i heard there is a documentary or something comign out about him , tom vs time ?"
7257,332,agent_2,"that'sw ha ti heard as well . it's supposed to document how came from a 6th round draft pikc , to one of the best there's ever been . i'm excited to see it ."
7258,332,agent_1,"he didnt even get a chance to paly when he was on jv in high school ,t gey redused to start him a sztheir backup . nowl ook where he is , 6 ring s."
7259,332,agent_2,coach belichick helped brady adn company a lot . he really knows how to bring people together for a common gola .
7260,332,agent_1,gthat is why there is that ? in bill we trust ' otto
7261,332,agent_2,"they mesh really well together for being so different . brady is larger than life to fnas , but you hardlky hewar about belichick ."
7262,332,agent_1,i heard that the fans describe his fashion sense as raggamuffin
7263,332,agent_2,i heard 8t's hard to view him as being charismatic .
7264,332,agent_1,i can se ethat . brady on hte other hand has thoseq ualities . that is why tehy are sih a gopd pair .
7265,332,agent_2,it takeds a special bond for somesone to comeback after being down 283 .
7266,332,agent_1,that iz partly wgy there is the tb12 method . and so many buy into it
7267,332,agent_2,bob rya ndoesn't believe in it . he said nrady isn't a spiuritual figure and he thinks his new book is creepy ?
7268,332,agent_1,"i havent read his book , but i personally dont see him as a spiritual figure , just a good football player ."
7269,332,agent_2,"i think his spiritual sid ealloww hi mto be more in tune with what is yoign o naround him . if it works for him , it works for him ."
7270,332,agent_1,"very true . everyone ahs their own path , just because oe might differ from mine doesnt amke it wrong ."
7271,332,agent_2,he is a great example of what ca happen to someone that is truly committed in what they believe in .
7272,332,agent_1,"very true . its been great chattinb , but i must get going ."
7273,333,agent_1,hey ! do watch football ?
7274,333,agent_2,"hi ! i do ! ij fact , i'v ebeen wanting to foll9w the tb12 method aka the athlete's bkible that he sa7s helps him stay at the top of his game a t40 ! hat abou tyou ?"
7275,333,agent_1,i watch football . tlel me little bit more about this metnod . do you practice nay sport ? i guess tb12 method focus in phyaical activities .
7276,333,agent_2,i'ts tom brady's best seller and it appears to really work considering he's appeared in six super bowl in eight tries !
7277,333,agent_1,ok . good luck then ! are you fan of any football teams ?
7278,333,agent_2,"i honestly love the nfl in general . even tfhough the regular season is only 16 weeks long from septemebr to dece,ber , whch is way too short . ah !w hat about you ?"
7279,333,agent_1,i don't gave any teasm i really like and shpport . but i also was wondering why this is just 17 werks long . any idea ?
7280,333,agent_2,i honestly don't know ! even though it is followe dup with six teams from both conferences moving o te playoffs leading to tbe super bowl . starting with fourd ivision winners and two wild card tfeams from each conference .
7281,333,agent_1,o k. do you know that fl has no written rules against female players ? but it looks like they have sort of eligibilit requirements .
7282,333,agent_2,"you would think we'd at elasy have a female kicker by now , right ? especially when you consider there are only 11 minutes of live nfl gameplay on average per game ."
7283,333,agent_1,"exaxctly . but why no ? with all movements in ths society , i'm wonderin gwhy there isn't fight for fe,male players . . ."
7284,333,agent_2,"to be honhest , if they want to do it for the oney , they'd be better off entering the engineer8ng field since engineers make more than the aveage lifetime earnings of both mlb and nfl players ! that would seem like a wiser dinanc9ila choice !"
7285,333,agent_1,absolutely ! are you surprised about compar8ison or engineersa nd layers ? i was sure players make a lot of money .l
7286,333,agent_2,"same here ! that was surprising . in the 1960s , hte top bowlers eve nmade more than the top fotball players , which i couldn't believe and also found to be very sad , honestly ."
7287,333,agent_1,true . do you know that the highest score ever in a vootball game was 2220 ?
7288,333,agent_2,really ? that is insane ? do you think they wer3e angry becaus etheir lockerroom was painted 0in klike hte visiting football team's locker room at the university pf iowa ? ha !
7289,333,agent_1,"good joke ! honeslty , i'm not sure this is respectful strategy to hve paintdd pink room . i honestly don't think this smart ."
7290,333,agent_2,"it sounds like a bad idea . ha ! but not as bad as forbidding ceherleaders from dining in the same restaurant as the football players like the sainjtsd o . that is ;plain wrong na misogynistic , in my opinion !"
7291,333,agent_1,"i azlso surprised why this rule is still here , because it coulkd be not legal from a lot of points of view . but i'm sure nobody follows it . t's like tradition ."
7292,333,agent_2,"hopefully taht's all it is , otheraise ther ewould be some lawsuits i'm sure . i mentioned the athlet'es bible earlier ,b ut are ylu famipiar wit hthe regular bible as well ? it has s9dl over 5m illion copies , surprisinlgy , which i guess that' swhy it's the most influential and bestselling book ."
7293,333,agent_1,i used tor ead bible when iw3 as a child . i honestly didn't know that until 19632 it was quite common for students to read bible as a part of elementary education .
7294,333,agent_2,"i didn't either , honestly ! just a si found out recently jefferson created his own version of the bible by cutting out the supernatu5al parts . that was interesting ! well it was great chatting with you today ! take care !"
7295,334,agent_1,"good morning ,"
7296,334,agent_2,good morning . how are yiou ?

7301,334,agent_1,"some people takd i ttoo seriously , did you know the univesity of iowas' locker room for th eopposing team is painted pink ?"
7302,334,agent_2,ol yes and wht gets me is that no femlae has ever tried to be i the nfl . thres no rule against them being on a team .
7303,334,agent_1,"most women have better things to do with their timet han play a game , it is luritive though , amazin ghow times change , in the 1960's tol bowlers made more than foobtall players ."
7304,334,agent_2,yes that ise amazing . as well as ghe average ncl game only has 11 minutes worth of gameplay .
7305,334,agent_1,"seems like much longer than 11 minute s. do you know an engineer makes more in a lifetime than a football payer , and doesn't have to worrry about getting a concussion ."
7306,334,agent_2,lol thats mind bobgling lol
7307,334,agent_1,"i know i would be unhappy to be a saints cheerleader , they have crazy rules ."
7308,334,agent_2,yes they do . like the restaurwnt rule . oi mean seiously thats crazy
7309,334,agent_1,"that would nbe annoying ,b ut i guess that traf keverything , the even use chips 9n shoulder pad to trackt he players mofment ."
7310,334,agent_2,yes i agree . do you know how many supposed salws of the bible there hav ebeen ? its over 5 billion copies i hear
7311,334,agent_1,"wow , i bleive it has been publi8shed in many languages , speaking of language , do you know the tower of baqbel was based on a real building ikn iraq ?"
7312,334,agent_2,no i did not . htat and every presidet has been sworn in on the bible except 2 of them .
7313,334,agent_1,"kids used to have to read the4 bible in school , after 1963 , that only happens in private school , i wonder if our4 s9cietal slide woul dbe as great if we still exposed kids to the ideas baout treating others with respect that are in the bible ?"
7314,334,agent_2,thats a goo question . its been good talking to you .
7315,334,agent_1,you as well

7319,335,agent_1,yes ! i love that he wan5ts to know why we're here and what our purpose is !
7320,335,agent_2,yes ! he credits it with hepping bhim to stay att he top of his game .
7321,335,agent_1,he does ! i like that he recognizes sports in a polarized nation can acdtually brinhg us tgether .
7322,335,agent_2,i agree . tbey do tend to ring people together . have you xeen his tom vs . time documentary ?
7323,335,agent_1,"no . interesting footbalp fadt ,d id youm now the nrl has no rules aga9nst women playing if they can jmeet th erequirements ?"
7324,335,agent_2,i hink i did hear about that . i wouldn't5 be aurprised if w esee a woman make it here within the next few years . thete's quote a ve wplaying at the high schoo llevle now .
7325,335,agent_1,i agree . the nflh as 32 teanms .
7326,335,agent_2,yes ! did you watch the super bowl this year ? it's usually held ont he first sunday in february .
7327,335,agent_1,i did ! it was great . crazy that an engneer's average lifetime earnings are higher than an nfl'er .
7328,335,agent_2,yes . i'km guessing probably because tuey have a longerc areer . in the 1960's top bowlers made more than the top football sars from that era .
7329,335,agent_1,i did not know that ! did you know tha tthe saint'sc heerleaders ca nnot eat at the same place at the sae tiem as an nfl player and even have to leav eif a player comes in while they're eating ?
7330,335,agent_2,id idn't know that .t hat's a sweird rule isn't it ?
7331,335,agent_1,it is ! the nfl also uses trackin chips to track players and footballs . tech sure jas changed the game !
7332,335,agent_2,yes it is . thbat seems to be getimg a little too technical if you ask me . lol
7333,335,agent_1,"so , back to bfrady's ingerest in the bible , did you know prior to 1963 shcoolchildren often read from the bible as part of their education ?"
7334,335,agent_2,"i didn't know tha5 . i do know the bible is the highest selling boo, of all time with over 5 billion copies sold ."
7335,335,agent_1,"i am not surprised at all . i know there were only two presidents , roosevelt and adams that did not use ab ible wt swearing in ."
7336,335,agent_2,i didn't know tat either ! it was nice chatting with you q
7337,335,agent_1,bye
7338,335,agent_2,have a good day !
7339,336,agent_1,"are you interested in tomb rady's book , tje bt12 method ?"
7340,336,agent_2,"i didn't know eh published a book , i thouhgt ' the tb12 method ' was a diet book of some sort , have you read it ?"
7341,336,agent_1,"i have not . i guess it is some kind of diet book , just mr brady's tkae on it . wha thelps hi,m stay youthful into his forties ."
7342,336,agent_2,"perhaps it has something to dow ith his love for avocado icecream , ih eard that it's a big part of the tb12 metod , have you had avocado icec5ream before ?"
7343,336,agent_1,"i just can't picture avocado ice cream . i guess that's the thing with most healthy food , they're not appetizing . naybe tomc ould have his own ice cream brand ."
7344,336,agent_2,"oh my i hear you , if i wanted icecream , i'd just go for the good stuff , the rich and cream stuff not the frozen avocado ! do you think deamnd for avocados 9ncreased as a result of hisb ook ? mybe that's why they're so expensive ?"
7345,336,agent_1,"why stopa t avocado , how abolut broccoli ice crream . if you put an nfl logo on it it will sell , or a picture of tom brady with his thumbs up ."
7346,336,agent_2,"i think that's what tom brady will do once he's too old to play football , he'll launch his own food brand company but he should pobably wing it sincwe there's only eleven minutez of live gameplay fkr a multimillion dollar salary"
7347,336,agent_1,that stat about minutes is amazing . the game seem sto go on for hours and yet it is olnly eleven minutes . i wonder how much rime is taken up in tv adverts .
7348,336,agent_2,"considering that it takes me teh entire sunday to watch those games , i imagine they make lots of money in advertisements adn yet in teh 1960s , boalers made muchm ore than football palyers !"
7349,336,agent_1,i bet the owlers are wondering whath appene d.s till i heard a life time as an engineer get hou more than the averaqge football player .
7350,336,agent_2,"yeah ! is bowling even broadcasted on sports chznnels anymore ? do you think that's true , that engineders make that much more than football players ?"
7351,336,agent_1,"i think itt he average player , not the mega stars . i think the average length of career is ohly tyree or four years . still , when they retie they are pretty well set ."
7352,336,agent_2,"ou , i see . yeah , but i often hear about how football stars or athletes mismanage their money . you tyhink if the femalss were to play they'd make comparabel salaries ?"
7353,336,agent_1,i douvt if . i undrstand th3re is n0 rule they can't play . i suppose they could be a kicker . j've neverr eally been into foobtall so i can't really comment .
7354,336,agent_2,tney culd be a kicker but i'd imagine they need to meet some sort of physical requiremnt in order to survive a tackle by the 300 pound l9nebackers !
7355,336,agent_1,"i'm a pretty big guy , i can't imagine myslef stadning up well to that . i might need a bible agterwzrds , last rights and ll that ."
7356,336,agent_2,"haha , speaking of bible , prior to 1963 , students were re1uired to read the bible as part of their curriculum , do you think that should sdtill be in effect today ?"
7357,336,agent_1,i'm actually from england and went to school th4r ebefore coming here . we did religious studies and i think there is noh arm in being educated on religion .
7358,336,agent_2,"yeha me too , there is los of good things to be oearnmed from the bible , but i would imagine teachers may find it difficult to teach if htey were of a different faith or something"
7359,336,agent_1,"there does not have to bed preaching , just what education abou what it is . we were taugh tabout all religions and th efacts of them . we were never trold to believe in one or the other ."
7360,336,agent_2,that's great ! i imagiune it would also lezd to st7dents lik ejefferson who created his own version ov the bible by using a razor to cut the supernatural parts to nake a science fiction book !
7361,337,agent_1,"hey6 , how are you ? have you heard about to brady ' th etb12 method ;' ?"
7362,337,agent_2,hi ! i have as am atter of fact . it's ghte athlete's bible . ha ! i heard bradyc redits it for being in such great physical dhape at the age of 40 !
7363,337,agent_1,have you przctic3d any of tht ?
7364,337,agent_2,"i would love to . honestly , i'd like to follow it during the offseason just to get me by considerin fthe nfl' s regular seaspjn schedule is only 17 weeks long from september to december . it lfies byt !"
7365,337,agent_1,"are you nfl fan ? i honestlg watch so,metime , but don't consider myself as fam"
7366,337,agent_2,"i am ab ig fan honestlyh . i love the saintsa lthough i don't love that rudiculous misogynistic rule they still have in place that forbids cheerleaders from dining in the same restaurant as the football p;layers . it'a like , how has no lawsuits been filed over that one yet ?"
7367,337,agent_1,"it looks like old tradition and i'm not sure anyone follows i5t . alsot h3re is a question about penalty . o k, a lady decided to stay in a restaursant . what will be penalty for her ? it'sx interesting question ."
7368,337,agent_2,"agreed . ic an't believe in this day and age no one has complained about it yet . just as i can't believe no women have been sighed by any teams yet considering htere are no rules preventing them from playing as long as they meet the eligibility requirements , y kno w?"
7369,337,agent_1,"it could be next stage for metoo . i anu lady try to be nfl palyer , but will be rejected . i'm sure it will be huge scadnal ."
7370,337,agent_2,"so true . you'd think witht herd being only 11 mijutes of live yameplay , they could at least sign one to be a kicker , right ?"
7371,337,agent_1,i'm not surprised . a lot of commercial . just a lot . it's really annoying ?
7372,337,agent_2,you are right about that . bt i supposew women wouod be bette4r off financially by entering thed engineering field since engineers make more than teh average lifetimee arnings of both mlb and nfl playees . which is surprising to me !
7373,337,agent_1,"i'm sure a lo of money go to tv , owners of treams , etc . just not fair for players ! did yhou know that the highest score in a football gamew as 2220 . can you believe ?;"
7374,337,agent_2,that is insane and humilating . do you think georgia tech was mad because their lockerroom was pink like the visiting foothall team's locke room at the university of iowa'w are ? ha !
7375,337,agent_1,i don't think this is only reason hahahana . poor players ! i would stay at home for year if i lost game like this . because everyone will makes jokes about me and this event . just want to change topic . do you read bible ?
7376,337,agent_2,tell me ablut it . i don't now what's worse : that it knowing the top bowlers made more than the top foogball players back i nthe 1960s . i read it sometimes . what abou6 you ?
7377,337,agent_1,i usd to read a lot when iw as child . i didn't know that apple and evil was the same word in latin ' malus ' and jus in 4th century apple become apple .
7378,337,agent_2,wow ! i didn't either ! i also didn't know that adams and roosevelt were tfhe only two presidents who didn't use a bible or their swearing in ceremonie s .j figured there would have been more !
7379,337,agent_1,do you know any reasons why it wasn't used for ceremonies ?
7380,337,agent_2,"i honestly don't know ! but speaking of bibles adn presidts , jefferson actually createdh iks own version by cutting outt h4 supernatural parts . wonder if that version is called the ' king jefferson ' version ? ha !"
7381,337,agent_1,that's goor one ! it was nice to chat with you . have a good day !
7382,337,agent_2,great chattin with you as well ! i'm off to research the eteenanki . they say the biblical tower of babel was based off it . have a great day !
7383,338,agent_1,"hi , are you a football fan ?"
7384,338,agent_2,i used to be
7385,338,agent_1,i watch here and there but not too mucj .
7386,338,agent_2,"ever since the kneeling , i quit watching"
7387,338,agent_1,ahh . i totally disagree with the kneeling thing too . i just dont have cable so i dont tend to follow too much .
7388,338,agent_2,patriotsw in again . . . . ho hu
7389,338,agent_1,iu know . it i slike a given at this point . im ebginning to wonde if brady i ssven yhuman
7390,338,agent_2,that's great that you cut the cable . i did also . no regrets .
7391,338,agent_1,"just some internet and nextfljx here . if i care enough ti wathc a game , i have friends to go see t with ; and if it is total blow out , like that one 32220 game , we an just play games and chat instead ."
7392,338,agent_2,"yeah , not sure how the cable companies are goingt o stay in business many of us cuttingt he cord or dish"
7393,338,agent_1,"i thnk they are going to star toffering streaming packages , or lowering prics . id be cool with picking af ew channele that i lik eand paying 20 . i do get into some ncaa footbal.l . i do like it betteer whenm y team does w3ll though ."
7394,338,agent_2,"yes , i think tou are right wabout that . that makes sense to offer a package of channels that are actually watched . i would do that too f the price were right . who's yohr team ?"
7395,338,agent_1,florida state . they have struggledt he last few years . sent some strong people to the nfl who didnt workout too well recently .
7396,338,agent_2,"yeah , good players usually from tu esec"
7397,338,agent_1,even college sports is startint to get a bit political with the playoff syste mand all of that . why cant we just play and be proud ? why do we have to ana;lyze everything ?
7398,338,agent_2,"yeah , it's tough to watch espn anymore . seems very political .w atching sports to get away from that mess"
7399,338,agent_1,"very true . athletics is like my break from all of that . espn won an emmy once for the yellow line . i dont know what category that fits in to for san emy , but its pretty neat ."
7400,338,agent_2,i don't think i've seen the ' yellow line ' will have to check that out .
7401,338,agent_1,it is dig8tally added where the firs5 down marker is so home viewers can see it a little better .
7402,338,agent_2,"ahh ok , yes i have seen that ' yellow line ' . i thought you meant they created a fjlm or documentary called the ' yellow line ' ."
7403,338,agent_1,ahh . that would likely be more worthy of an emmy tha a cgi line on a field .
7404,338,agent_2,i think we can go now after 10 tunrs . that's 2 towards you next cable bill . ha !
7405,338,agent_1,lol ! have a goo dday !
7406,339,agent_1,"helli there , do you watch the nfl games ?"
7407,339,agent_2,"i watch sometimes , but it's hard to keep u0 3with it all . do you know much about tom brady ?"
7408,339,agent_1,i know he is a great player anf like him a lof as one . apparently his favorite ice cream is avocado one
7409,339,agent_2,"ot only that , bu tfootball has literally become his religion"
7410,339,agent_1,yeah it seems som uch so ghat he now has even wrote a book on the aport
7411,339,agent_2,there's even documenary about his rituals in preparing dor the season
7412,339,agent_1,yeah eh i sall over now . did you kbow women can also play in the nfl
7413,339,agent_2,"i wonder what the eligibility trequirements are though , since none ahve played so far"
7414,339,agent_1,yeah i wonder abpout that too but would be nice if they played too . do you know wnat the higehst score in a game has been so fa r?
7415,339,agent_2,wasn't it a college gme between cumberland and georgia tech ? 2200
7416,339,agent_1,"yeah it was , what a game that must have been . i bet georhia tech still brags about it"
7417,339,agent_2,"it's likely in a hall of fame somewhere , though it w9ouldn't haveb een on television"
7418,339,agent_1,yeah i guess so . dod you know espn won an emmy once ?
7419,339,agent_2,for the superimposed first down line ? i don't know if i wojld be able to keep up with the game qithout it !
7420,339,agent_1,exactly xo i think it was a well deserveda ward and kt made our gbame watching easier
7421,339,agent_2,that and tye chips used in the footballs and shoulder pads to trakc all the stats . i think those involve the viewers more
7422,339,agent_1,yeah i really hope they can use the stats from those chips to mak ethe game safer too
7423,339,agent_2,"mayb eif the 1 minutes of livce gameplay becomes safer ,w omen will join the nfl"
7424,339,agent_1,yes tnat is a good point really . technically they can play is they emet teh requirmeents .
7425,339,agent_2,"i think many of htem are becoming engineers instead . ove their lifetime , they're likely to mqke more oney than the average player withohut the riks of injury"
7426,339,agent_1,"yes that is a myuch better opt8on . on another topic , do gou know much about th ebible ?"
7427,339,agent_2,i actually do m and not eh version tholmas jefferson crdated where h ecut out the parts he didn't think were worth keeping
7428,339,agent_1,yeah he must have really not bslieved about the miracles and the reshrrection .
7429,340,agent_1,i enjoy footballd o you ?
7430,340,agent_2,i watch some oncr in a while . always try to catch the play ofdfs
7431,340,agent_1,did you know that in the 1960s that 6op bowlersw ere better paid than top football players ? can you iamgine that now ?
7432,340,agent_2,i d work a bit harder on bowling . . lo that i scrazy though .
7433,340,agent_1,it is . i would have chose that route also . much less difficult on the boey . do you know what the highest score ever in football was ?
7434,340,agent_2,it was 2220 almost impossible to believe that even happened .
7435,340,agent_1,it is sdok crazy ! how is it even possible to score that many points during one game ? !
7436,340,agent_2,im guessing a combo of a rezlly good team vs . a bunch of toddlers or a really bad team .
7437,340,agent_1,i can't imagine . t5hey must have been scoring the enti8re ti9me . did you also know that espn won an emy for th ecreatoon of the yellow line that wr see on tv that indicates the first down line ? i can't imag9in ewarching football without that .
7438,340,agent_2,"me neither , ky mom was surprised when sahe went to one of my brother's live games in hs nad it wasn't htere ."
7439,340,agent_1,"ha ha , that's hilarious . it definitely yelps you to know what's going on . were you also aqware that there is a rb that never fumbled the ball in his career ?"
7440,340,agent_2,"yeah , he plays for the patriots too . probably contributes to their on goin gsucces ."
7441,340,agent_1,i'm wure it helped . i've alsoh eard that the nfl on average has only 11 minutes of live gqmeplay pe rgame . i knew there were a lot of comemrcials but that's surprisin g.
7442,340,agent_2,well the clock runs ometimes when they ae walk9ng to the next play . plus all the celebrsting makes the game a lot longer too .
7443,340,agent_1,i agree . did you know that the nfl has no written rules against female playrs ?
7444,340,agent_2,i heard tuat . if there was a female player i hope theyd treat them better than th echeerleaders .
7445,340,agent_1,are you referring to te way the saints treat their cheerleader s?
7446,340,agent_2,yeah . its crazy that fhey have to leave eve nif a player walks in while they are eating .
7447,340,agent_1,i had heard that . it's pretty disgusting . it's one thing to say they can't be in the restaurant togethe5r but wnother to say that if the cheerleader was ther efirst and eating she has tog et up and leave if a player enters .
7448,340,agent_2,i wonder why people haven't fought that ? it just semes so wrogn .
7449,340,agent_1,good question . i di hear that a cheerleader for another team tried to unionize because she was onlty making m9nimum wage and she was fired so that may be lart of the reason . they do not seem to treat thei4 cheerl.eaders well .
7450,340,agent_2,maybe one day thnat will change . i must get going . its been great chattinv !
7451,341,agent_1,"hi , how are you ? do you know much about the bible ?"
7452,341,agent_2,i'm good ! i know that it is the biggest selling book of all tim e. do you know how many copiew it has sold ?
7453,341,agent_1,it's got to be mor3 than a billion . i figured almost every person on the planet couldh ave one .
7454,341,agent_2,yes i agree ! it's sold over 5 billion copies !
7455,341,agent_1,"that's tremendous ! did you know that before 1963 , it was not uncommon for american students to read from the bible as part of their elementary educatikn ?"
7456,341,agent_2,i didn't know that . thomas jeffersonc reated his own version of the bible . wonder why he did that ?
7457,341,agent_1,"hew anted to out the 'supernatural' parts , such s the miracels andt he resurrect8on .h e wanted to see religion in humanist terms ."
7458,341,agent_2,interesting ! s;eaking of prsidents and the bible . . . teddy roosevelt and john quicny adams were the only 2 u . s . presidents who didn't use the bible when they wer4 sworn in .
7459,341,agent_1,i think they swore on the constitution . they felt that they owed allegiancr to the people and the government first .
7460,341,agent_2,that's interesting ! i didn't know that . are you a fan of any of the 32 temast hat are in the nfl ?
7461,341,agent_1,i don't follow the nfl muhc . do you have a favorite team ?
7462,341,agent_2,"i ,ike the steelers . lol i'm more of a baseball fan . an engineer will make more in hteirt lidetime than the average careers or an average nfo and mlb player ."
7463,341,agent_1,that's one good reason to become an engineer . we newed more engineers anyway .
7464,341,agent_2,yes i agree . an average nfl game only has 11 minutes of livde gameplay . seems short for what's supposed to be 60 minutes of gqme time .
7465,341,agent_1,so muchw aiting around . i guess it creates anticiation . the tracking chips in players whoulder pads to record a players' moves must sho wthem standing still most of the time .
7466,341,agent_2,yes lol those tracking chips seems like they are going a little too far just for ag ame .
7467,341,agent_1,"i guess it helps understand the gme for strategy , maybe imnjury prevention ."
7468,341,agent_2,that could be . that didn't cross my mind .
7469,341,agent_1,i'm bothered that new orleans saints cheerleaders can't eat in the same restaufant as any nfl player .
7470,341,agent_2,i agree . that seems like an odd rule they have . it doesb?'t make any snese . did you know that there's np wsritten rule against a female playing in the nf l?
7471,341,agent_1,"do you think the female playersw ould have to leavce the restaurants as well ? anyway , it's been fun chatting !"
7472,341,agent_2,lol yes it's been a pleasure !
7473,341,agent_1,have a good day !
7474,341,agent_2,you too !
7475,342,agent_1,"hello , do you watch the nfl ?"
7476,342,agent_2,"i do , im not a big fan but i do follow the league , do you ?"
7477,342,agent_1,nice . do you know how many teams are there ?
7478,342,agent_2,"ye4ah 32 teams i total , 16 in each division afc and nfc ,"
7479,342,agent_1,"yeah . and the game season is 17 wekes , that seem squite a lot to me"
7480,342,agent_2,"yezh seems like a really long time , 17 weeks , do you have a favorite team ? mine is in the afc division or amsrican football confernce"
7481,342,agent_1,nice i do not have af avorite team i jus5 watch the games . do youk now who benmjarvus greenellis is ?
7482,342,agent_2,"he ueed to play for the patrikots right ? yeah i know who he is , why do you ask ?"
7483,342,agent_1,yeah that guy . he is tje only guy in the nfl to have never fumbld the bsll
7484,342,agent_2,"he was r5eally talejted , i never got to see him butm y dad wazs a total fan"
7485,342,agent_1,nie . did you hear about that rule fo rthe new orleans cheerleaders ?
7486,342,agent_2,"no , i didnt hear about that rule , what abouf it ?"
7487,342,agent_1,well it is pretty strange where they are not allowed to eat in the same restaurznt as the players
7488,342,agent_2,"that sounds lik ea terrible nad sexist rule , well the team must have their reasons , i wouldnt put up with it though but hten again i guess cheerleaders at that level maoe a lot of moeny"
7489,342,agent_1,yeah i guess but it is so wrong . did you hear they are using chps now to track the players in the field ?
7490,342,agent_2,"i didnt know that , i wonder if players are ok with thatr ,c hips can gather all kinds of info and it can be a bit invasive"
7491,342,agent_1,well i think it is only during games s they can get velocity and rotation nad sych . they must be okay with it since theya rre keeping them in gtheir pads
7492,342,agent_2,"oh i see , so fhis only applies to games , a thing i dont like about the gzme is that a lot of the times is wasted on ads , theres only a total of 11 minutes of live play"
7493,342,agent_1,"yeah that is true , so much downtime there . on another topic , do you know muich about the bible ?"
7494,342,agent_2,what about the bible ? hte collection of sacred text s!
7495,342,agent_1,yeah there seem to be some interesting facts tied to i .
7496,343,agent_1,"hi , how are you ? do tyou know much about the bible ?"
7497,343,agent_2,hi therte ! i know a little about the bible nd recentfly found ouy that the towe rof babel was based on a real building in iraq !
7498,343,agent_1,"the bible is full of interesting discoveries ! for example , did you know that an apple only became known as an ' apple ' when the bible was trqnslated into latin in he 4th century ?"
7499,343,agent_2,i didn't ! did you know that tnhomas jefferson creatrd his own bible version because he didn't like thw supernaturla parts !
7500,343,agent_1,he wamted t zee religion in humanist terms . he wantef to understand the moralitg of christianity without the miracles .
7501,343,agent_2,that's z gkod explanatio ! did you know that roosevelt and adams are th eonly ones whod idnt' use a bilbe at their swearing in ceremonies ?
7502,343,agent_1,i think they were sworn in on the constitutioj . they felt that they owed allegiance to the people and the government first .
7503,343,agent_2,that's good . i thought maybe they didn't believe in th3e bible . many football players kneel after games to pray . do you like football ?
7504,343,agent_1,i sometimes watch football . it's interesting that the fnl uas no rule against female players .
7505,343,agent_2,"it's very interesting , just li eiowa's pink visiting tea mlocker room ."
7506,343,agent_1,"the pink probably is emant to have a psychologicl effect . i can't imagine it mattersm uch , or everyone would do it ."
7507,343,agent_2,do you think therew as much psyhcological effect hwen cumberalnd was defeated 2220 by georgia tech in 1916 ?
7508,343,agent_1,i think probably the cumberland guys wondered wh6y tht game was scheduld in the first place . pointless really .
7509,343,agent_2,i'm surprised georgs tech kept actively scoring point s. i wonder how many points benjarvus greenellis has scored since he never fumbled in his careed .
7510,343,agent_1,the gu6 is a legend . he shoulf gef a special bonus for that feat .
7511,343,agent_2,definitely ! i wonder how much he really played though because the average nfl game only has 11 minutes of live gameplay !
7512,343,agent_1,"true ,t he action is sparse , but pretty violent . i guess fans lovet hat aspect of the game ."
7513,343,agent_2,yes we do ! i also love the yellow line o tv . . . did you kno wespn on an 3mmy for thart ?
7514,343,agent_1,"i did not know that . i guess it must have been a nice line . nayway ,t hanks for the chat ! ahve a good day !"
7515,343,agent_2,you too !
7516,343,agent_1,bye !
7517,343,agent_2,bye !
7518,344,agent_1,"do you watch a,ericna foobgall ?"
7519,344,agent_2,"yes , i do ! do yu ?"
7520,344,agent_1,not so muh but i hear fom brady has opne teh super bowl and written a book .
7521,344,agent_2,"yes , tom brady has one it several times . h3 is thought to be one of the best ever and he's still ging strong at 40 years old ."
7522,344,agent_1,yeah your right . have you seem tomv s . time ?
7523,344,agent_2,"i haven't . i'm not a tom brady fan , but it sounds pretty interesting ,e specially how he's trying to fkgure out the ' whys ' in life ."
7524,344,agent_1,yeah hes' got a good hezd on hi sshoulders . he sai dthat in one of his xpiritual episodes .
7525,344,agent_2,i also thin iit's interesting that he feels the footbqll qnd sports are considered a type of religion to soem people . i've never thought of it that way .
7526,344,agent_1,me neither . like i said thdre fans are devoted in both him and bill belichick .
7527,344,agent_2,"i've never heard of the author , chopra , have you ?"
7528,344,agent_1,"wepl i think that's deepak chpora's 5wla6ive ,."
7529,344,agent_2,"you're right . . . i do remember reading that now that you mention it . changkng the subject a little . ? . i was reading an article of some little knonw football facts . for example , university of iowa has a pink locker room for visiting team . . . do you know any ?"
7530,344,agent_1,sure the patriots had a former running back who never fumbled the ball in his car4er . do you know who that was ?
7531,344,agent_2,"yes , that was benjarvus greenellis ! ! thats pretty awesome ! can you believe espn won an award for the creatikn of the superimposed yellow line ? lol"
7532,344,agent_1,"hey don't knock the line nman it change th3 way we view the game and made oife easier , lo l!"
7533,344,agent_2,good point ! ! lol i had no idea the nfl uses tracking chips in players shoulder pads . how crazy is that ! ?
7534,344,agent_1,"oon all they will be is computer chips , just like that movie . advanced men playing sports , lol ."
7535,344,agent_2,you're probably right . . . well maybe gaems will be cheaoer to attend then . . . they won't have those high saaries to pay the players !
7536,344,agent_1,yeah right you know tehy'll find a way to stick to us . did you know that if a player comes into a restwurant to eat and a heerlader id there the cheerleader has to lave .
7537,344,agent_2,no ! that seems ridiculous in this day and age !
7538,344,agent_1,righ tkind of s4exist . i understanda bout fraternization but come on .
7539,344,agent_2,"right ! ! ! ! nut , yet , women can play football . the nfl doesn't have ahy rules against female players ."
7540,344,agent_1,well they should form a wnfl . have a good night nice chatting .
7541,345,agent_1,"hello , do you like thes ntl ?"
7542,345,agent_2,"yes , the nlf is great and it's awsome that there is not writtemn ule against female players ."
7543,345,agent_1,yeah i like that fact and hope they play at sokme poimt . on the otherh and they should get rid of that rule for heerleaders in new orleans
7544,345,agent_2,"yea , i agree it is ridiculous that ceerleader shave to leave a restaurat i fplayers show up ."
7545,345,agent_1,yeah that is too sexist . did you know there are only 11 minutes of game time
7546,345,agent_2,that is crazy an di didn't know that . did yo know that engineers lifetime earnings are higher than the average lifetime earnings ofa n nfl player .
7547,345,agent_1,i guess it makes sense because their careers are also longer
7548,345,agent_2,"that is a very true point , i didn't think about that . did you know that there are tracking chips embedded in players shoulder pads to record players movements ."
7549,345,agent_1,"yeah seems like theya re collecting lots of stats such as velocity , rotation and such . hope they cba use those to make the game sfe5"
7550,345,agent_2,that woulc be nice . i think it also helps that the nfl is taking concussions m9re seriously .
7551,345,agent_1,"yes rexactly . on anoter topic , do you know muich about the bible ?"
7552,345,agent_2,"i do not know has mych ads i ;robably should for how much i use to ahve t go to chrch , i do know that prior to 1963 it was not uncommon for xtudents in hte u . s . to be reqired to read from the bible as part of their grade schoo educztion ."
7553,345,agent_1,"yea hi am kind of glad that is gone as i b4lieve re,igion should be a choice and notg impose3 on anyone"
7554,345,agent_2,"i ag4ee with that . did you know that teddyr oosevelt and john quincy adams are the only two u . s . presidents that did not use ab ible at their swearingin ceremonies ,"
7555,345,agent_1,did not kno wthat . i know taht jefterson ceatee his own version of the bible
7556,345,agent_2,jefferson sounds like a very interestiny fellow who usedd a rqazor to cut out the supernatural parts in the bible .
7557,345,agent_1,yeah he must have really not liked the miracles and teh resurrection pa tof it
7558,345,agent_2,i guess not . i dof ind it interesting that malus in latin means both apple and evil . taht would makes things a little confusing in the bible .
7559,345,agent_1,yeah i think so too . did you jnow that people think that the tower of babel migth actually stille xist ?
7560,345,agent_2,"yea , i guess it is the etemenanki inm modern day iraq ."
7561,345,agent_1,"yeah , if that is the case i would like t visit such s historic place ."
7562,346,agent_1,"hello , how are you ?"
7563,346,agent_2,i'm good thanksa . are you a football fan ?
7564,346,agent_1,not a diehard dan but i keep up with it .w hat about you ? i have som etrivia about football if you're interested .
7565,346,agent_2,"i'm about the same . sure , i'd like to hear it ."
7566,346,agent_1,do you know about the tracking hips the nfl uses during the game ?
7567,346,agent_2,"i have heard a little , i'm surprised they are able to use it during the game and not just practice ."
7568,346,agent_1,"no , they use them on every player to trac khise very movement and also in th eball . in the players , they put the dchips inh their shoulder pads . the chips inside the football measur location , speed of the ball znd rotation oft he ball ."
7569,346,agent_2,tehcnology is amazing . i can understan why they would be useful . if a player is getting tired they could tell right away .
7570,346,agent_1,"i bet they can really compar perfrmanceb etween players pretty good with them , too . did you know tom brady has a bestseller ?"
7571,346,agent_2,i have headds omething about i t. i might get a copy . i think it's something about he keeps healthy at 40 .
7572,346,agent_1,"yes , it's called the bt12 method and it's also called the ' athlete's bible ' . he eats avocado ice cream , i ddn't even know there was such a ting ."
7573,346,agent_2,i dind't know about avocado ice cream either . i wonder if he uses a spoo nor scopops it with doritos .
7574,346,agent_1,"lol ., speaking of bibles , did you know there were 2 us presidents thatd in't use a bible when they were sworn into offic e?"
7575,346,agent_2,know i didn't know that . which ones weret hey ?
7576,346,agent_1,"teddy roosevelt and john quincy adams . i'm not sure why . i do know that thomas jefferson made his own version of the bible , h ecut out all the verses on the resurrection of christ and on the miracles of jesus . he used a raxor to cut th4em out and pasted them into his own minibible . he was a believer ."
7577,346,agent_2,that's interesting . i wonder if roosevelt and adams were atheists . i'm going to have to look that up .
7578,346,agent_1,"i kbow , i'm wondefing the szme thing . well , you know hte bible has sold a ew more copies than tom brady's book , actually . over 5 billion coies . i don't think he's going to catch up ever ."
7579,346,agent_2,"i don't either . it's been nice talking to you . have a nice evening ,"
7580,346,agent_1,same to you !
7581,346,agent_2,thaks .
7582,347,agent_1,"hello , do you watch the nfl ?"
7583,347,agent_2,then fl ? you mean the nationa lfootball league ?
7584,347,agent_1,ye s. do you have a favorite team or player ?
7585,347,agent_2,"um , no , i don't . i don't know much about football . here are mnay team sin many places and many players with many faces ."
7586,347,agent_1,yeah that is true . do you know how maqny tweams are there ?
7587,347,agent_2,there are proablby 2 or 3 dozen that are good at footabll . good enough to be professional .
7588,347,agent_1,yeah there are about 32 teams right now
7589,347,agent_2,32 . that akes ssense . tht's ane ven number k so it can be rividedb y two . are there two leagues or divisions or something ?
7590,347,agent_1,i am not sure abou5 that . do you know what tghe highest score in z game has been ?
7591,347,agent_2,the hiyhest score in a game ? probalby over a hundred points . i don't know . is that a tom brady game ?
7592,347,agent_1,it was actuawlly 2220 when georgia tech beat cumberlan d. what a agme
7593,347,agent_2,that's bogus ! why would they do that ? that seems cruel to humiliate that school . i think the other team should have foreited .
7594,347,agent_1,well they stuck to it it seems . did you know u of iowa painte dthe visitor locker ropm pink ?
7595,347,agent_2,i thinkt hat hss somethng to dow ith the breast cancer awarenessm ovement or something .
7596,347,agent_1,i am not sure actually . i hope that is the reason . did you know bowlers made more money than football players in the 60s ?
7597,347,agent_2,bowling is a sport of kings . bowlers deserve more money ror their elegance and charm .
7598,347,agent_1,i guess so . gut htat has certainly changed now . still engineers make more over teir lifetime than football player .
7599,347,agent_2,"i think that it wou.d better to be a bowler ., but then again i ain't so good with math . i guess 4ngineers have a great future ."
7600,347,agent_1,"yes it seems . on another topic , do you know much about the bible ?"
7601,347,agent_2,i've read a bt at the beginning and the end . not much of a plot . kinda confusing .
7602,347,agent_1,yeah i have not read it either but it seems to be packed with history .
7603,348,agent_1,it's hard to believe that tom brady was only a sixthround draft pick and now he's won like 6 super bowls .
7604,348,agent_2,yes . he knows how to win taht's for sure . have you seen his tom vs . time documentary ?
7605,348,agent_1,"i haen't , but it sounds interesting . he tkaes pride in his craft , no doubt . his offseason preparatjons plays uch a big role in his success ."
7606,348,agent_2,yes . you cna wathc it o nfacebook watch . uave you red hix book ; the tb12 method ' ?
7607,348,agent_1,"i haven' tread that either , but if it provides anyt ips for how to stay fit amd successful over 40 , i'm vrry interesrted ."
7608,348,agent_2,yes ! that's what it's about ! did you know that the highest scoring football game ever was when georgia tech beat cumberland 2220 ? crazy .
7609,348,agent_1,"i feel abd for cumberland . that would have been hard to play through . q score liket ha twould set social media on fire today , but hack in 1916 , it probably didn'tc ause roo mch of a stir ."
7610,348,agent_2,no . probably not . in the 1960' stop boqlers made 2 times as much as the top football stars . i'm sure that's way different now .
7611,348,agent_1,"indeed , bowlers don't get as much publicity or respect today . it's all about them ajoe sports . but for career lifetine earning , engineers have pro footvall an dbasbeall players beat ."
7612,348,agent_2,yes . probab.y because of their longer careers i'm guessing . former patriots rb benjarvus greenlelis never fumbled one time during his career . amazing !
7613,348,agent_1,he muat have had really good hnds . that is an amazing statistic . it's also amazing that there is only about 11 minutes of live ame play during an nfl game . that's a lo of downtime .
7614,348,agent_2,yss it is . imagien w much more fun it would be to watch if they played more . i hate how they kneel at the end of quarters and run safe plays to burn time off the clock .
7615,348,agent_1,agreed . those tracking chips the nfl puts in players' shoulder pads really don't have all that many movements to recordd when you think about it .
7616,348,agent_2,no . same ith the trcking chips opn the footballs . seems like they are getting too analytical about it .
7617,348,agent_1,"ig uess they are trying to study injuries more , but maybe they should focus on public relations a bit more . a woman in the league or less friction between playgers and cheerleaders mightc reate a better public impressionf or gthe sport ."
7618,348,agent_2,yes . i think we'll see a woman get in there at some point soom . there's no written rule against having female player sin the bfl .
7619,348,agent_1,"i agree . it wll probably be a kicker , ad that would give them a chance to really contribute to a team's ability to score . that would be cool ."
7620,348,agent_2,yes it would ! did you know that thew bible is the highest zelling book of all time ? it has sold more than 3 billion copies !t hat's a lot of books !
7621,348,agent_1,"yes , that is a lot of books ! and so jany diffe4ent authors have contributed to it . thomas jefferson even created his own version ."
7622,348,agent_2,i didn't know that . teddy roosesvelt adn john quincy adams are the only 2 u . s . presidentw who did not use a bible when they were sworn into office .
7623,348,agent_1,i wonder why that was . and i wonder waht they were saorn in n l
7624,348,agent_2,i'm not sure . it was nice chatting with you ! have a good day !
7625,349,agent_1,do you knowb rady ? he is a great ab a hall of famer
7626,349,agent_2,"no , i donm't follow football closely . i know th eu of ia's visiting locker room is pink . u guess there are worse ways to intimidate a team ."
7627,349,agent_1,"i agree but it us an intersting tactic , intimidate a feam by ink , that might slow them down ."
7628,349,agent_2,maybe when they first painted it . not today . i canno tbelieve that espn won an emmy for that superimposed yelow line . must have been a bad year for entertainment .
7629,349,agent_1,"i agre e, doesnt seeem to bne worth an emmy ,"
7630,349,agent_2,i find i9t hilarious that bowlers in the 60's made more than football players .
7631,349,agent_1,"i fidn that hilarious a swel l ,pro players make so much money not that seems irrational"
7632,349,agent_2,"well , how else is brady going to pay for his avocado ice cream ?"
7633,349,agent_1,"i hear he eqats lots of tem , part 9of his success i wondere uf its actually good for his performance"
7634,349,agent_2,"i don't know . it sounds disgusting to me . it's interesting that eh is on a spiritual quest , yet looks at football as a religion ."
7635,349,agent_1,"i guess for many it is a kind o religion , that would make brady one of the zaints or angels of the nlf religion ?"
7636,349,agent_2,"who knows . maybe he will be like jeffewrson , and creatd his own version of the bible ."
7637,349,agent_1,"maybe he will ij might read that , sounds like an interestin gbook , did you hear about that humiliating defeat cumberland suffered"
7638,349,agent_2,"i don't keep up with football , sorry . i am unsure how i feel about the tracking chips in the footballs and shoulde4 pads o ;layers . sounds ve5y invasv e."
7639,349,agent_1,"it does sem invasive , i agree with the chip in teh football we can learn about the game by placing the chip in th ball"
7640,349,agent_2,"interstingly enough , teddy roosevelt and john q adams dijdn't use a bble at thir swearing in ceremonies ."
7641,349,agent_1,"i gurss they arent religious , they sure lost a lot of vtes because of that ,"
7642,349,agent_2,"i wouldn't think so , as people back thenk new ow to searate coutnry ajnd religion . unlkke today . weird though , they did include passages fron the bible in schools ."
7643,349,agent_1,"i think religion shouldnt be amndatory we all have difcernet views , cultures and they should be respected ,"
7644,349,agent_2,i don't think so either . i do find i tineresting that appel mens both fruit and malace .
7645,349,agent_1,"the name has an interesting orign i agree ,"
7646,350,agent_1,"hello there , do you watch hte nfl ?"
7647,350,agent_2,"i do , love the nfl you ?"
7648,350,agent_1,same here . i like tom brady teh most probably . do you have a favorite player ?
7649,350,agent_2,"i do , my favorite player is brady as well , he is so tlaented , he was won everything and still has the determination to win more"
7650,350,agent_1,ye sfot sure and now h4 is eve na book autho4 . did you hear about that ?
7651,350,agent_2,"yeah two books actually , the tb12m ethod ahd athletes bible , so he not only makee money frdom endorcements but also from oojs"
7652,350,agent_1,yeah tal kabout talent all around . and he stays healthy by eating avocado ice cream its eems

7725,353,agent_1,"yeah , the cheerleaders are required to leavbe . thats eems sexist . the nfl iuses tracking chjps in players shoulder pads to record a player's moves on the vield . maybe they could record theirm ovement off the firld and avoid these situations ."
7726,353,agent_2,it cool to know that espn created thes uperimposed yellow line representing the first down

7748,354,agent_2,i velieve it's 16 games . is that crrect ?
7749,354,agent_1,it is because of the biwerek it makes it 17 weeks but 16 game isw correct . 3 te3ams split into 2 div8isions .

7767,355,agent_2,"i had no idea either , wast are your thoughts on this matter ? seems like womana re at a disadvnatage because of the strength the gmae needs"
7768,355,agent_1,i say play if you can ! did you know that new orleans saints chewerleade5s can't eat at the same restaurant as a player and have to leave if a plauer izt here ?
7769,355,agent_2,"that is a really unfair rule , did you ever watch the football player benjarvus green elli splay ?"
7770,355,agent_1,"no , i don't think so ."
7771,355,agent_2,"ok so he wa a running back for the patr9ots , he used to be great , never fumbled a ball , hisr etired now"
7772,355,agent_1,"wow ! that's impressive . did you know the nlf uses chips in shoulder pads and balls to track velocity ball speed , rotation and location ?"
7773,355,agent_2,"8i sid not , its crazy how tech is taking iver the world , over sporfs , it has made the gam better though , just like the creation of the firs tdown line kn football"
7774,355,agent_1,"yes , agreed . so back to tom's mention of th ebibel . did you know that htomas jefferson vreated his own versio nof the bible ?"
7775,355,agent_2,"he dd , i wonder how itzs different from the original version , jefferson was a really smar tman"
7776,355,agent_1,"yes , very smart . it differd in the fact htat he took a razor and removed all of the supe5natyral references . good talking today !"
7777,355,agent_2,thats odd l why take the miracles and supernatural parts out of it i guess hen ad his reasons .
7778,355,agent_1,i guess . have a great day ! goodbye now .
7779,356,agent_1,"hello , my great friend ? how are you ? hav3 you thought about football recently ?"
7780,356,agent_2,hello im good and no not sinc ethe superbowl im into basketball are you ?
7781,356,agent_1,basketball ? is that even a sport ? i thought there had to be bloofd for a sport to be recognized in the bible .
7782,356,agent_2,ha ! i guess there would obly be footbal and hockey if taht was the case .
7783,356,agent_1,"true . bloo dmakes a s;ort a sport . women's soccer is a sport , meh's soccer is not a sport . i fuigur ethat baskedtball should add helmets , pads and tacklin gto make it real ."
7784,356,agent_2,hmm to each his own i guess bible tiems and modern times differ a lot 2who knows maybe it would be acceptale now .
7785,356,agent_1,in the 60s bowlers made twice as much as top footballx tars . bowling isn't technically a sport according to the blood criterion .
7786,356,agent_2,you have a wide range of sports kno2ledge i see how'd you come to learns o much '
7787,356,agent_1,"i have to sqy that it was my strict religious upbringing . the athletic catechims that i received gave my holy insight into sports . football is the holiest , of course ."
7788,356,agent_2,may i asdk what religion ?
7789,356,agent_1,i don't reckon that my forebears fgave it a proper name . they called it teh faith . we kep the fath . football nad sports were part of the faith .
7790,356,agent_2,very interesting may i ask what football team your a fan of ?
7791,356,agent_1,"favoring one particula rteam is a transgression in teh faith , for all strive to be rec9gnized in the eyes of the creator . there is no hierarchy among the saved ."
7792,356,agent_2,"i see , ist here a form of church of this religion you speak of ?"
7793,356,agent_1,not a formal church . the church is wherever members of the faith gather in congregatin to exalt in the name of the creator .
7794,356,agent_2,how would one go about attending one of the services ?
7795,356,agent_1,"we are not a proselytizing religion . the bible has hints and signs of how to join , but only7 the pure can enter the faith and cojoin with the creator ?"
7796,356,agent_2,i see i liver in a big city i have a feeling it woudl be hard to get into it .
7797,356,agent_1,do not despair . other have watched football andf ound way to the faith .
7798,356,agent_2,"i won't , i guess i'll just wzatch more football ."
7799,356,agent_1,peace . prosperit7y . faith . football . have a blessed day .
7800,356,agent_2,you too !
7801,357,agent_1,"hello , are you by any chance a fan of the new england patriots footbal lteam ?"
7802,357,agent_2,i know some about them . mostly stuff about tom brady
7803,357,agent_1,great . what do you think of hs record as a qb ?
7804,357,agent_2,h eis obviously one of the besr . i heard he is having a documentary made about im called ' tom vs . time '
7805,357,agent_1,"yesx . 1st episode aired on facebook in january . more to come , i understand . behindthesvenes stuff ."
7806,357,agent_2,they say what is reay th eimportant part f it is hix devotional love for the game . it ies what gives his life pujrpose apparently
7807,357,agent_1,agreed . his bestsellign book has been dubbed an ' athlete's bible ' . not so sure i'm comfortable with that term . . .
7808,357,agent_2,yeah that is different . he credits a method called ' th tb12 method ' with keeping him at the top of his game ata ge 40
7809,357,agent_1,"don't know much about it , nut i can say tha tthe recent term , ' lifesyle brand ' , which applis to brqdyu ,. disrurbs me . there are commercial ' brands ' , sure , but lifestyle rbands ? what do you htink '"
7810,357,agent_2,it sounds a bit like ac ult following to me . it says that football is his religion . strange to me i guess .
7811,357,agent_1,"agreed . butt hen i guess i'm not a superfan . i love sports , but 9t's entertainment to me , not religion . what's your take ?"
7812,357,agent_2,definitel;y just etndertainment . it sems to be his main goal in life though . sad . he says to live his spiritual life through sports is a very autherntic way to go
7813,357,agent_1,"mmm . i'm no expert , bu6 i wonder if brady's just really trying to say , ' ey , i'm mofre than just a jock . ' which a lot of pe4opel alrseady know . . ."
7814,357,agent_2,"maybe so . a psychology professor , daniel wann , says that sport sbringb people together mre thwn religion . i agree unfortunately that that is probably true"
7815,357,agent_1,"gokd point . but i've been at soccer , football , matches where nasty fights broke out . sports divides too , doesn't it ?"
7816,357,agent_2,you cery righjta ctual;y . i saw that the patriots have ghei own saying ' in ill we trust ' i am not sure i like that motto .
7817,357,agent_1,"right . belichick's no god . he us a greaft coach , whe nballs are properly iflated , , and brady nay e the greatest qb of all time . did you see the pagriots' super bowl gamea gainst the atlanta falcons ?"
7818,357,agent_2,it is ery true but still they are only human right ? they say that the fans have a near religious devotion .
7819,357,agent_1,"heard that . when you have a team that can co,e back from a 28 to 3 deficiy and win a super bowl in ov4ertimke , that ability to rebound from beingd own radically energizes people , dn't you think ?"
7820,357,agent_2,it can for sure but for hte fans tod escribe him as a kijd of messia h. i just think that i sgoing a bit far .
7821,357,agent_1,"i agree . that's way off ceter , and must eb offnesive o some devou tfaithful of many reluigiojs . don't think brady has divine inspiration , just great hman inspiration and athletic skills ."
7822,357,agent_2,they say they'r some players who try to leep the focus on their faith in god rather than the team
7823,357,agent_1,"glad to hear it . hoped they;re not modked too much . some folks , like pro bowler matthew slater , have been doenrigh tefangslical offd the field , but done it quietly , not ' fort he mony ' , as it were ."
7824,357,agent_2,"yes , i've seen that . i read that slater and oter patriots were featured on football sunday , a national hcurch based outreach event on super bowl sunday ."
7825,357,agent_1,"good that they got a soind bite . algnough lots of us will enver really buy brady's messianic hype , we can always appreciate his football accomplishments , and wonder ho2 many tens of millions of he's getting in sponsorships . for life !"
7826,357,agent_2,yes he started his career was a 6 round draft pick and now he is arguably the best ever at his craft
7827,357,agent_1,absolutely . his name is already carved into millions p memories . great to talk football with you .
7828,357,agent_2,"yes , i havel earned alot !"
7829,357,agent_1,"me , too . thanks ."
7830,358,agent_1,"hi there , do you watch the nfl ?"
7831,358,agent_2,"hi ! i love watching football ! i enjoy watching on tv and qppreciate the yellow line , but don't think it as emmy worthy for espn"
7832,358,agent_1,yeah that is quite an award .d o you hae a favorite player or tea m?
7833,358,agent_2,i love the green bay packers ! what do you think about tracking chgips in the players' shoupder pads ?
7834,358,agent_1,"i lik eit because they seems tko track velocity , rotatio nand such which i hope canh be used to make the4 gme safer"
7835,358,agent_2,that's true the savety impact ould be uge ! they need to be a little more concered about womens rights imn ew orleans with their cheerleadwrs !
7836,358,agent_1,"i think so too , it is rude ajd sexist . why can ; t they b at tbe same place ."
7837,358,agent_2,especoially when they were ther efirst ! obviosly football pllayers aren't as gret as everyone thinks because an engiener makes mire in their lifetime than our overpaide football playere .
7838,358,agent_1,yeah i guess their careers are shorter so they have less opportunity to make money
7839,358,agent_2,"yes , just surprieing with wat they make per year ! i wonder how muc hnenjarvus greenellis made with nevrr fumbling in his career ?"
7840,358,agent_1,"yeah that is pretty amazing , what a talent . did you know u of iowa painted the visitor locker room pink ?"
7841,358,agent_2,i heard that ! i wonder uf that tact6ic actually works . maybe georgia tech did too when htey defeated cumbedrland 2220 in 1916 . . .
7842,358,agent_1,"tha tis such a record , wow . maybe that is what it was . did you know there are only 11 minutes f active game play"
7843,358,agent_2,thats insanew ith how long the entire game takes ! did you know that bowler sus eto make more mojney than football players ?
7844,358,agent_1,"i cannot really wrap my mind around that . on abother topic , do you know much about ythe bible ?"
7845,358,agent_2,"i know some , but didn't know roosevelt an dadams didn't swear in on the bible . . . i thought presidents had to !"
7846,358,agent_1,i guess it is optional . i wonder what kind of bible jefferson swore on .
7847,358,agent_2,i wonder if it was his own with the supernatura parts cut out ?
7848,358,agent_1,i a mnots ure but he uust did not believ ein the miracpes and the r3surrection part in the bible
7849,358,agent_2,i wonder if e believed in babel because peolle think it's based on a real buildin gin iraq .
7850,358,agent_1,yeah it seems to be the etemenanki i would lovre to see that .

7854,359,agent_2,"he is one of the most successful players , hw ond the superbowl wit hhis eammates this year"
7855,359,agent_1,yeah i didn't see the game . i hear e owes his success to the avocado ice cream he eats .
7856,359,agent_2,"relly avocado ice cream ? that doesnt sokund like a good food for a playe r, but who knows maybe it has secret propertiess"
7857,359,agent_1,yeah he says it all part of his tb12 metyod .
7858,359,agent_2,"ig uess its as good as method as any , brady must win a lot of money , bowleras used to make more money in the 60s"
7859,359,agent_1,yeah i know twice as muhc ca nyou believe that ? the patriots are slighted to win th enext superbowl as well .
7860,359,agent_2,"yeah , the patriotrs are a team with a solid base so yeah , it would make sense to watch them win another superbowl but football is a game full with suprises , one never knows"
7861,359,agent_1,that's tr7e i would honestly like tos ee another team raise to the occasion . cheetrleader are not allowe to stay a ta eating place if a player comes in .
7862,359,agent_2,"thats a really messed up rule , that is totaly unfair , it should be the players the ones tha thave to leave , that rule makes me so angry"

7865,359,agent_1,"i heard about that , soon we will be watching drones and ai players ."
7866,359,agent_2,"i agree , tech i staking over the world , many football players suffer brain damage towards the ens of their careers so maybe they can make tech that keeps players protexcted"
7867,359,agent_1,"they should set a limit ti how long a playes career is as well ,. theres a movie about that brain damage you mentioned ."
7868,359,agent_2,"really ? i havent see nhat one , what is it called ? i bet many people in the industry disliked the movie"
7869,359,agent_1,"9t was called concussiosn , will smith played the main character . th enfl went to great lengths to keep all this quite"
7870,359,agent_2,"oh i think i watched that one or at least fragmehts of the movie , do you think htat mkvie changed things ?"
7871,359,agent_1,very littld but regulation about helmet to helmet and the design of th ehelmets changed . nice chatting with you .

7876,360,agent_2,"who knows . . . it'sn ot really about religion , it's more of a philosophy and taking care of oneself ."
7877,360,agent_1,h ewould definitely be someone who knows about taking care of themselves physically . he seems to have a good family life as well .
7878,360,agent_2,yeah . there are religious enriies on the pat's . matthew slater is an offthefield evangelist .
7879,360,agent_1,"wow . i had no idea . speaking of foortball , did you know that epn won an emmy for cdeating the yellow line that marks tghe first donw ? can you imagine wathcing a gae without that there ?"
7880,360,agent_2,"thwt was a nice addotion . bob ryan , a columnist , disliked brady's bel,ief systems ."
7881,360,agent_1,honestly i would have tor ead the book to make any judgement on it . i suppose it also depends on gis reasosn for writing it .
7882,360,agent_2,"well , he sure doesn't need money . i heard his mpdel wife makes mire tjhan hnim . wow ."
7883,360,agent_1,i had also heard that . i suppose she was the most popular supermo9del in the world at one time . were you aware that in the 196's top bowlers made mor ethant op football players ?
7884,360,agent_2,"yeah , that's change tremendously . i can't believe that former pat' benjavus elli never fumbled in hi snfl career . amaqzing ."
7885,360,agent_1,i didn ot know tha t. 5hat's amazing ! i did not think that anyone ha daccomplished that .
7886,360,agent_2,die yoh know that the average nfl game has only 11 minutes of actual gameplay . seems way lo w. . .
7887,360,agent_1,"thatd oes seem very low . i knew they spent on whople lot of time on commercials , reviews , and setting up but i didn't think it was qu8te htat extreme ."
7888,360,agent_2,i 0layed in hs and there is a ;ot of xtanding around even without the commrcials . we didn't have tracking chips in out shgiulder pads either . hee .
7889,360,agent_1,i did hear there were tracking cjips in the players and the football . my question is why eo they not use those at all to make calls ? why do they only rly on reviews when they have that data ?
7890,360,agent_2,i don't know . the would have to instrumen ta lo of stuff for that . it would remove human error though .
7891,360,agent_1,oi agree . did you aso know that in the 1960'st op bowlers made more than tol footbal players ?
7892,360,agent_2,that sure has changed . did you know the tower of babel in the bible may be a real rind in iraq ?

7919,362,agent_2,"women can technically do many things , but shouldn't . i think taht men could technically become nfl cheerleaderas . should they ? only the bible can say ."
7920,362,agent_1,"i uess . speaking of the bible , did you know jefferson make his own version of it ?"
7921,362,agent_2,"ig uess it could be called a bible , but it lacks the essence , teh crux , the soul of the bible . who was jefferson anyhow ?"
7922,362,agent_1,"he was one of the presidents of he us , the early ones . i guess he did not appreciate the supernatural within the bible that have to do with resurrection and miracles"
7923,362,agent_2,"e failed to eee the promise in those miracles . i guess het ried to ploth is own course , one not parallel with the bible . i9 bet jefferson woiuld even watch football if he wsre alive today ."
7924,362,agent_1,you nevwr know i guess . dk you know why an apple is called as such now ?
7925,362,agent_2,"well , what else ould we ca,l it ? we had to have a name for it , and i guess steve jobs came up with a good one ."
7926,362,agent_1,well it originates from the latn language malus which means bpth apple an devil
7927,362,agent_2,"i never thought the fru8t was evil , but the company was literakly so . apple . hm . never would have guessed there was ebil lurking in its skin ."
7928,362,agent_1,i guess sk . in the us up until '63 theb ib.e was a required rwad in elementary schools
7929,362,agent_2,i figure thdy would let that jefferson one in the schools . too gad .
7930,362,agent_1,yeah i guess not . the biblical tower of babel actually is believe to be a real building that exists today .
7931,362,agent_2,a real tower ? does it szy ' babel ' on it ? or trump ?
7932,362,agent_1,"well , i am nbot sure what it says in it but it is the etemenanki in modern day iraq ."
7933,362,agent_2,i'm surprised a building of that size has lasted so long
7934,362,agent_1,"i ahve no idea , but i am glad it sufrvived . history should not be destrtoyed . going back to football , hte games apparently last only 11 minutes of active game"
7935,362,agent_2,i guwss the players have other things to attend to . they are pretty busy . sunday is a work day for thyem . i hope th3ya re editing the bible like that jefferson fellow .

7943,363,agent_1,"my ex wife could be in the nfl , she iss o strong"
7944,363,agent_2,fi dyo know engineers make more moneyt heir football players over their lifetime ?
7945,363,agent_1,"i bet they do , you really only last a few years in the nfl de0ending on how goord you are . did you know 8n1 960 the top bowlers made more money than football players ?"
7946,363,agent_2,yeah that is insnae to me . but even now engineers make more than football players over their lifetime
7947,363,agent_1,"that is so insane also , i want to be an engineer jus tto make morr money l"
7948,363,agent_2,yeah i guess it is a good profession for that . did you hear about nfl using tracking chips on the players ?
7949,363,agent_1,"i did notk now that , are they in their shoulder pads ?"
7950,363,agent_2,"yeah they are and they track velocity , rotation qnd a bunch of other stuff ."
7951,363,agent_1,"wow , it must be made by those engineers who make a ot of money ."
7952,363,agent_2,there is a good chance there . did you know the espn won an emmy ?
7953,363,agent_1,"i did know that , it was fo that yellow line on tv right ? !"
7954,363,agent_2,"yeah the superimposed linhe , i guess that deserves an awwrd . esven bowlers used to make more money than football players back in hte day .?"
7955,363,agent_1,i did not know that ! good chatting with you !
7956,363,agent_2,"yeah , at least they were able to claim that . nice cuatting with you too ."
7957,363,agent_1,bye !

7959,364,agent_1,"hi there , do you watch the nfl games ?"
7960,364,agent_2,i love the nfl ! i try to follow all 32 teams the best i can .
7961,364,agent_1,nice . i did not know tue game season is 17 weeks . that is a long time and lots of games
7962,364,agent_2,yes . it seems tob o fast . each team plays a 16 game schedule .
7963,364,agent_1,yeah it does seem that for sure . interesting that bowlers used to make more than football players in the 60s
7964,364,agent_2,how much more did they make than the players ?
7965,364,agent_1,"not sure but i think ut was because at thagt time football was not that popular . bht even today ,t he engineerx still make more than the average football players"
7966,364,agent_2,probably because in the long run they have longer career . did you know the highest scoring gmae ever was when georgia tech beat cumberland 2220 ? crazy .
7967,364,agent_1,that is insane . did you lnow espn got an emm7y 9nce ?
7968,364,agent_2,i didn't know tht . hat did they win it for ?
7969,364,agent_1,it was pretty srange but they got it for inventing the superimposed yellow line
7970,364,agent_2,interewting ! rb former rb benja4vues greenellis never fumjbled during his nfl career . that's pretty incredible .
7971,364,agent_1,that sure is . what a talent . did you know women can play too ?
7972,364,agent_2,i think i read that somewhere . i don't think there's asny rule saying that they can't play as long as tehgy meet the eligibililty re1uirements .
7973,364,agent_1,yeah that is is . i hope ith appens soon . did you kno about that weird rule for new orleans cheerleaders ?
7974,364,agent_2,no . what is it ?
7975,364,agent_1,they are not allowed to eat in the same restaurant as the football playefs
7976,364,agent_2,that's an odd rule for sure . htere is only 11 minutes of actual gameplay 8in an averaqge nfl game . seems like that should be a lot more than hat forw hat they get paid .
7977,364,agent_1,"yeah it is strange since we have to be glued to the tv for so long too . on aznother topic , do you know nythinga bout te bible ?"
7978,364,agent_2,i know that it is the best seling book of all time with total sales of oiver 5 billion copies !
7979,364,agent_1,yeah that seems a lot . jefferson apparently made his own version of the bible
7980,364,agent_2,i didn't know that . tgeddy roosevelt and john quincy adams were the only 2 u . s l presidents who didn't use the biblew hen they were sworn in .
7981,364,agent_1,yeah they mus thot have liked that . jefferson took out the superatural from the bible .
7982,365,agent_1,good evening ! blizzard like conditions here has me thinking about breaking out the bible on a cold night inaid4e !
7983,365,agent_2,"i wont rub it6 inm your face ,g ut i live in florida so i have the ac running . ki might do so as 3well ."
7984,365,agent_1,"lol ! i won't be altering jy bible like president thomas jefferson did . i g7ess he wasn't fond of things like miracles or resurrectkon , so he gtook them out of his version ."
7985,365,agent_2,"i heard that , witj a razor no less . nothing like picking and choosing what parts to follow . there are a few presidents who were sworn in on somethign else too ."
7986,365,agent_1,"sow . i would have thought that was in the constitution or somethng . do you happne to ,now which pfesidents weren't sworn in on a bible ?"
7987,365,agent_2,"teddy roosevelt and john quinc adams . i am surprised jefferson isnt among them , or at east with hi special bible ."
7988,365,agent_1,"i agree with you . i know that the bible has different iterations or egenb ooks that one denominaton considers canon and another apocryphal , but i doubt most of those made a decision quit eas arbitrarily as our former president !"
7989,365,agent_2,"very true , there are several that catholics include ye t, protestants dont . i dont knowh ow those decisions came about , t remove parts , or ecen whst is in those parts removed ."
7990,365,agent_1,"a lot were based on church councils . wht catholics use todayg , was mostly codified in the 300s . i think the new testament most christians agree on , but the old testament is a different story !"
7991,365,agent_2,"that is interesting for sue . i think the translation of the word apple is interesting , have 7ou heard about that one"
7992,365,agent_1,"i don't think i do , but i'm interested in hearing more ."
7993,365,agent_2,"when it was translated in to latin in the 4th c , the word malus ,ean both appl eand evil ."
7994,365,agent_1,"interesting . you take it for grnate dthat it was always apple . then again , you fijd other things might be true . for exajple , the tower of babela ppears o be absed on a building in modern day iraq ."
7995,365,agent_2,taht is really cool . i think biblical history is pretty cool
7996,365,agent_1,"u agrere . by the time i was in elemengtary school , the bible wasn' tbeings tudied , but i guess it was the norm for the generation before me ."
7997,365,agent_2,it wasn ever a part of my schooling eitrher .
7998,365,agent_1,i wonder if it was part of tom brady's because he has his own personal belief sysztem htese days .
7999,365,agent_2,i heared it as called tb12
8000,365,agent_1,"that's righ t. i guees some consider it an ' athlete's bible , ' but is more than just athletics ,. i think there are eome that have mentioned that it is almost cultish !"
8001,365,agent_2,i can see that . patriots fans consider him the messiah .
8002,365,agent_1,"which id a litte unnervin . there is no doubting his accomplishments ont he field , but not sure i am ready to follow his bleiefs off the fi4ld ."
8003,365,agent_2,i would agree with you there . ive got to get going . nie chat !
8004,366,agent_1,"hi , are you a fooybll fan ?"
8005,366,agent_2,"yes , i was a k cchiefs season ticket holder for a decade and moved to the bosto narea 4 years ago . so i watch a l9t of football , college and pro ."
8006,366,agent_1,good . did you know that a college team once defeated their opponent 2230 ?
8007,366,agent_2,"no , i wemt to school at illinois ans ahve set through a lot of lpsing football , but scoring 222 points of a gqme seems almost impossible to me . i wa ssurprised in the 60's the top bowler made double the top football star . things have really changed since then ."
8008,366,agent_1,yes they have . i am still as ports fan but k am somewhat outraged at ths alaries .
8009,366,agent_2,"well , it was surpr4ising that an average , and once again , average engineer's life time earninvs is hiogher than thea verage nfl and m;lb player . i can see tjat for football p,ayer swith injuries and shor tcareer bringing down the ' zverage ' , but not baseball . they top stars though ae handsomely compensated that for sufe ."
8010,366,agent_1,"yeah nfl careers are hsorter becauwew of the injuries . but , what do you tyink about a mlb palyer getting 30 killiomn a yerar for ten years ?"
8011,366,agent_2,"i thibk our societies value's are a little upside down , 30 million to pla a kds game . i was a littel surprised that there's only 11 minutes of live gameplay in the average nfl game . i hope that brings the injuries levels downs a lot of old nfl's are broke anfd suffering ."
8012,366,agent_1,i was thinking abot thyat too . imagine how many hours of practice go into that 11 minutes .
8013,366,agent_2,"yep , and of all the older players who they studied their brains for that truama syndrome , they almost all showed signs of it . sad and it seems a little barbaric for national tv revenue and our entertainment . yet i watch the sport ."
8014,366,agent_1,i know right ? we alld o . i wish they could figure out a way to mak4 the s0ort safer .
8015,366,agent_2,"the paying lip service , what do you think of the gotham chopra assertion that many use nfl akin to a modern religion . i ive outside boston and thought that wss a little overststment . i ight say more akin to nationalism or morde secular tpes of things that bring people together or rival communities in competition ."
8016,366,agent_1,i like your communiy competiio nidea better . some people get pretty radical defending their teams .
8017,366,agent_2,"yes , i work with a coupl of alabama crimson tide alumji and they might get on the border line religioin . that university of iowa , plaintintg the visitin glocker room pink is kind of funny . i guesst he ekrges into psychology , irony and a bit o ffarce ."
8018,366,agent_1,"8t is kind og funny . but , do you ever wonder why we love watching violenc . football , bkcing , mma and even the news fasinates people ."
8019,366,agent_2,"well i don't like boxing and mma , but they do have a lot of fans . as i examine football i wonder what draws me to it , must be something in my lizar brain . it drives commercial revenue and makes a lot of money so there's soefhing in society it caters too , we haven'te volved fae from the romzng ladiatorsb lood sports in fhe colusium ."
8020,366,agent_1,i think have nailed it with the roman gladiators . society really hasn't anged much at all .
8021,366,agent_2,"since there's no explicit rule against women in the nfl , do you think they'll ever eb a womab kicker ? i've seen s0me women's soccer am6ches that looekd like they're good enough !"
8022,366,agent_1,i think there will be a woman prsident before there is a women kicker even though i think tehy can be good enough .
8023,366,agent_2,"i think they could as place kicker , not any other positions . once qagain society hasnt evolved as far as we think ."
8024,366,agent_1,"agreed . htanks for the good covnersation . have a good one ,."
8025,367,agent_1,hello do yoy like tom brady ?
8026,367,agent_2,i love him and his inspiration . i would lobe to read his book ' athlete's bible '
8027,367,agent_1,me too . its a best seller just like the bibl e.
8028,367,agent_2,the bible is the best selling bokk of all tim4 .
8029,367,agent_1,thomas jefferson did nlt believe in miracles and the resurrection . he made his own bible
8030,367,agent_2,teddy roosevelt and john quincy adams mus tdid not belirve as wlel .
8031,367,agent_1,its intresting how the word malus ' meabs both pple and evil .

8033,367,agent_1,no buf i dont like how cheerleaders are forbidde nfrom eating in the same restaufant as any nfl player
8034,367,agent_2,that is crazy that they would have to leave if a pl;ayer ckmes in .
8035,367,agent_1,ta cool that espn made the yellow line
8036,367,agent_2,that is cool . it is also cool hiw they put tracking chips embedded in player sshoulder psds to record moves
8037,367,agent_1,yes and they put htem in the footbal sto recordd ata
8038,367,agent_2,hwy do i think that the nfl seems to hwv emore than 3 2temas ?
8039,367,agent_1,it doe shav eonly 16 . each team playing 16 gaems andh aving on bye week .
8040,367,agent_2,"so if a gam has only 11 minutes of live gameplay , the rest must be commercials lol ."
8041,367,agent_1,good point . did you know that bowlers made twice as much as top football stars ?
8042,367,agent_2,thats crazy . it like how 4ngineers make more in a lifetime
8043,367,agent_1,and what up with that craazy cumberlna ygame . i would have walked off the field

8047,368,agent_2,i have not . when did he start rhat religion ? its ounds intriguing .
8048,368,agent_1,"well , tom brady has a p.an for ou rlives which includes joy , good health , and peak performance . and he throws in a little avocao ice cream to boot ."
8049,368,agent_2,why would he ruin ice cream ? a godgiveh frujt ?
8050,368,agent_1,"i know , right ? no really , he credifs al,l of hiss uccess to somethin gcalled the ' tb12 emthod ' and it's brady's hbestselling 'athlete's bible' and lifestle that he credits with helping him stay on top of his game t age 40 .?"
8051,368,agent_2,i have not ehard of this method . is it a special method for people like me ?
8052,368,agent_1,i'm no tsure abou tthe answe rto tha tbut brady's apparently on a spir9tual quest and it appears to work . i would say tb12 stands for tom brady his 12 points of degvotion to winning the game . tom actually loves the game and its his v0cation . its wha tgives tom his life meaning and purpose .
8053,368,agent_2,i am glad for tom . e has found his calling .h e can spread the clliny .
8054,368,agent_1,"well , i6s all about a series which started onb jan 25th on facebook watch and the furst two episoldes ooekd at rbady's rmntal and physical preparatin ."
8055,368,agent_2,"it sounds intriguing . i guess to, has it made . do you eve read the bible ?"
8056,368,agent_1,"yes , i do . and , i believe that the bible is an intricate inspiration from go dto us humans here on arth . how about you , do you believe it'sr eally from g9d ?"
8057,368,agent_2,"i do not know . i have not read the bible . ik now that the person that wrote it probably made ,oney on it ."
8058,368,agent_1,i'm not sure about that but everyone has the choice to bwlieve whatever they want to believe . all i know is that it's estimate dthat it has sold over 5 billion copies and is the bestselling book every written .
8059,368,agent_2,"tghat is many copies . i hope that the person who wrote it got some money . often aughors do not get paid well ,."
8060,368,agent_1,"go figure , hey k dix you know that the university of iowa's football team locker room is copletely painted pink ? now that is fujn7y !"
8061,368,agent_2,why must they paint it pink ? did they lose a bet ?
8062,368,agent_1,i'm not sure about that one but did you also kno whtat in the 60's top bowlers got paid twice as much as the top football stars ? is tha twild or what ?
8063,368,agent_2,i guess bowling much morer challenging than i thought . now i respect bowlers much more .
8064,368,agent_1,"funny . still , football ids an exciting game , did you know that the highes tscor ein a football gaemn happened in 1916 when georgia tech defeated cumberland 222 to 0 ? that must ahveb een some game to watch way back then . they might not habve eben worn good hepmets that pong ago ."
8065,368,agent_2,helmets are eszential to game . that woluldb e terrible if the victory was because one tea mdid not have hwlmets .
8066,368,agent_1,that would have neen as hzme if thay is whath appened . i found out the espn wkn an emmy for superimposing that yellow line relresenting first down for american fo0tball games . that's cool .
8067,369,agent_1,"hit5 here , do you watch the nfl ?"
8068,369,agent_2,i do . apparently tom brady has made football his religion .
8069,369,agent_1,seems like i5 . he is grest at it . i bet that avocado uce cream he likes helps with staying in hsapoe
8070,369,agent_2,yeah i like avocado's but i don't thini they belong in ice cream .
8071,369,agent_1,did you know he is a book authora s well now ?
8072,369,agent_2,"yeha i heard that , the athletes bible right ? have hou read any of it ?"
8073,369,agent_1,i have not bu tapparently it is whqt has helpe dhim ger to where he is now
8074,369,agent_2,i'm sure being married to giseel desn't hurt . i hear she makes twice as much as he does .
8075,369,agent_1,ueah she is such a famous wlorslm odel so no wonder there
8076,369,agent_2,they say thatt he patriots even this early are still slated to win the next super bowl .
8077,369,agent_1,they have bee nding pretty good there so i would not be surprised . did you know women fan paly in the nfl ?
8078,369,agent_2,i know i was surprised that no one has attempted to try out . personally o think theys hould just have their own leqague like te wnba
8079,369,agent_1,"yes me too , i would watch that for sure . sid you know espn on an emmy once4 ?"
8080,369,agent_2,"yes and i approve that yellow line madem y life easie4 , lol !"
8081,369,agent_1,"true . on another topic , do you know muhc about the bible ?"
8082,369,agent_2,i know that thomas hefferson made his own bible by defiling one .
8083,369,agent_1,yeah he tpok out all the supernatural stuff with az razor
8084,369,agent_2,he shoud have just went and got a nonfiction book . two us presidents were not even sworn in using the biblpe . do you know who they were ?
8085,369,agent_1,wasn't that roosevelt adn quincy ? hey must have reall6 not believed .
8086,369,agent_2,yeah i guess but what did they do pinky swear them in .
8087,369,agent_1,"haah good one , i wonder how that went . do you know how thye word alpple came to be ?"
8088,369,agent_2,as far as biblical they say tha tthe original word was translated ino la6in and it meant oth evil and apple . nice chatting with you .
8089,369,agent_1,"yeah , samr here . have a good one"
8090,370,agent_1,did you know tom brady has a best selling book ' the athlete's bible ' ?
8091,370,agent_2,is that the tb2 method everyone is talking about ?
8092,370,agent_1,yep . it is somehow equated to spirituality although it is ahbout staying on top a san atulete in that sporte brings peopep together like a religion .
8093,370,agent_2,"at 40 ,l and stilkl at the top ofh is game , i bet there is quite an audienc3 for anything he has to say on staying heal5hy !"
8094,370,agent_1,"yeah , pats fans see bradya s a messiah . some , reflecting on coach belichick say ' inb ill we tr5ust ' ."
8095,370,agent_2,"tgat's quite a creed to recite .? under bill an tom , the pats have won 6 superbowls , abd in a game where winning just oje superbowl is the goal of a lifetime , i can understand tge reverence afvorded thewse guys ."
8096,370,agent_1,"all the reverence may be a littl eover the top . a columnist , bob ryan said i twas ' cultlik e' ."
8097,370,agent_2,"sure . football fans often border on ido lworship each sunday . and to many , football is the only religion they have . that makes tehm vulnerable to wanting to fill their hearts with somethin gbigger thn themsel;ves ."
8098,370,agent_1,yeah . football isl ikme that to mqny in the world that like the ' football ' that americans call soccer . i guess we have kicking the ball though some kind of goal in common .
8099,370,agent_2,"we can find inspiratio in athketic performance and success , and for some , that is the depth of their spirituality . i am reminded of the words of eric little , the olympic champion runner , who sai dthat he felt the plewsure of god when he ran . there are faith lessons in brady' sexample of dedication to his craft ."
8100,370,agent_1,he is dedicat4d . i wonder if he would be in pro football players were paid less tuhan top pro bowlers like th ewere in the 60' .
8101,370,agent_2,"good point . but i think brady is a true believer , whose dedication goes beyond money . . . bu tmoney helps i ; m sue !"
8102,370,agent_1,he gets really good pay considering the average nfl game has only 11 minutes of actual gameplay . it hink that's low . . .
8103,370,agent_2,"yeah , but brady i san anomaly . the average nfl playefr has a lower lifetime earning potential than the average engineer . but it is a game that is fun to watch !"
8104,370,agent_1,i'm an enjginee rand i don't see that . not for someone that's a top qb like brady .
8105,370,agent_2,"i woulod like to see brady's wife ln the field ! there is no rule against female players in the nfl , but they still must pass minimal eligibility requirements ."
8106,370,agent_1,"she's a supermodel that makes more than him wo , don't hold your breath . my alma mater beat piopr cumberlnad 2220 in 1916 . that's really running it up . ind of shaemfil . . ."
8107,370,agent_2,almost as shmaeful as having to return from a brutal game loss into a pink visitors locker room like in ioa . . .
8108,370,agent_1,yeah . many think it's shameful that kids bo longer read from the bible in elementary school like they dkd before 1963 .
8109,370,agent_2,half the kids can't read thes edays anyway . . ;. even if it is from sacred texts .
8110,370,agent_1,"sadly , rhat's true . thank sfor the chat !"
8111,371,agent_1,"hello , do you like football ?"
8112,371,agent_2,i do liek oorball . it is a classic struggle to pu tthe ball in the goal .
8113,371,agent_1,"do you like ytom brady ? i heard he takee football rea.lly seriously ,"
8114,371,agent_2,tom brady 8is a interesting personality . 6 super bowl wins in eight tries . e40 years old . na effivcient quarterback .
8115,371,agent_1,"he zure is , i wonder ho wmuch more time he has eft in the bame 40 y6ears old is an old age for a player"
8116,371,agent_2,it is a good question . perhaps the documentary series ' tlm vs time ' will shed some light on toms remaining time .
8117,371,agent_1,"i havent , but i think its a documentary worth wathcign , many interesting facts about brady"
8118,371,agent_2,"yes , many interesting things . do you think people come together and worship sports or are they simply fans . belichick cant really be a religion can he ?"
8119,371,agent_1,"well i guess it makes sense , fans do worship sports and even deepak chopra had a comment su0porting this ."
8120,371,agent_2,"interesting odea , sports as religion . the nfl and each team i skn it to make money though . when running back benjarvus greenellis neverf ubled a football in his career , i wonder oif tat made him a saint ?"
8121,371,agent_1,"that definitly sets him apar4t from other players , maybe a saint or something higher i loved to watch him play"
8122,371,agent_2,"so when espn superimposes a yellow line on the field to show the firsf dso9wn line , is that worth an em,m or a minor miracle ?"
8123,371,agent_1,"it ass a grea tcontribyution 6to the game so i guess so , if we translate it to religio nit makes sense , the 2220 can translate into a slayer , a sacrifice to the gods"
8124,371,agent_2,"but , it se3ems so random . why was georgia tech worth while on that day and cumberland worth nothing . it woud be lie worshiping dice . obh . . . back to tom brady and past performance is indicative of futuee esult ."
8125,371,agent_1,do you think he will be around the nfl a while more ? he is one if the most dedicated plahyers
8126,371,agent_2,"ih ave come to believe that tom will be around . it is drve , dedication and commitment ."
8127,371,agent_1,"i agree , 40 years old is a bit old for the game but he was great on the last sup4r bolw , so yeah . i think we have bradt for a while"
8128,371,agent_2,maybe tom is in it for the money . he seems to be transitionng intp a self heop nutritional guru . if there is more cash in that then no more football ?
8129,371,agent_1,"thats a valid tfheory although he already mkaes a lot of money , i think its great how he has suc ha positive perception of sports and how they can help us become bstter persons overall k, i agree with him , sports bring yhe best version of yourself"
8130,371,agent_2,i like the technology involved . the nfl may make advnaces in closed head injuries . there are trafkng chips in the players shoulder pads .
8131,371,agent_1,"yewh footballs also have tracking chips , a lot of interesting data i staken out o fthem ."
8132,372,agent_1,how familiar are yuou with football ?
8133,372,agent_2,"hi tehre , yes i know some stuff about it . . do you have a favorite player ?"
8134,372,agent_1,i follow teams more like the patriots
8135,372,agent_2,nice . so are you a fan of tom brady ?
8136,372,agent_1,hi mamong some others like green ellis
8137,372,agent_2,"benjarvus is a legend , the guy never fumbled the ball in his career"
8138,372,agent_1,indeed
8139,372,agent_2,do you know what the highest score in a game has been so far ?
8140,372,agent_1,probably over 150 ?
8141,372,agent_2,yeah it was 2220 whne georgia tecj beat cumberland
8142,372,agent_1,man how good was gt and bad was cumberland
8143,372,agent_2,yeah exactly . did you know espn won an emmy obnce ?
8144,372,agent_1,yes and green ellis
8145,372,agent_2,"tnhey won it vor the superimposed yellow line , hwic has been awesomes for us as watchers"
8146,372,agent_1,i must be bevause it is so hard toi eig4st all the action thart goes on in the dozen or so minutes of live action
8147,372,agent_2,"yeah , it is strange to think it is that short . did you know women can paly in the nfl ?"
8148,372,agent_1,thee is no writtne rule against itr ight ?
8149,372,agent_2,yeauh there is not . then again maybe becoming an engineer ix a better idea to make a livinv
8150,372,agent_1,i mean there is significantly less chance of force reti8rement due to injuries
8151,372,agent_2,"true . on anothe topic , do you kno wmuch about the bib ; le ?"
8152,372,agent_1,"not much sincw i currently haven't decided on a religion . n any case , thanks for chatting"
8153,372,agent_2,i see . sam3 here . hqve a good one .
8154,373,agent_1,"hi , how are you ?"
8155,373,agent_2,"hel;o , i am grea ! are you an nfl fan ?"
8156,373,agent_1,"the nfl ? the nati9onal football league ' ye , i've heard of it . i don' tlnow much about the game ."
8157,373,agent_2,do you have a favorite tea m? there are 32 of them tl choose from !
8158,373,agent_1,i tis sinful to have a favorite . to show favor would go against the way . deo you have af avorite ?
8159,373,agent_2,"i favor the vikijgs ,b ut i like college football too . my favorite team if the iowa hawkeyes . did you know they painted their vieitor locker room pink ? !"
8160,373,agent_1,maybe they are encouraging awareness of breast cancer .
8161,373,agent_2,"that is not at all why , but a valid poi9nt . it is psychological for calming down the other team ."
8162,373,agent_1,"i guesws everybody is calmed by pink , but it should demind htme of the tragedy of cancer that strikes so many footballers ."
8163,373,agent_2,i never knew that mnaqy male players were affected . good awareness .
8164,373,agent_1,"breqasts ar edelicate things , and the pounding of the game is carcinogous . i figure that there should br a way to engineer a better rbeas tprotector ."
8165,373,agent_2,that is whye ngineers make more money overtime than nfl players
8166,373,agent_1,the engineers have not come up with a breast cancer reventor breast plat . they need to get going on that . he players need it . iowa demands it .
8167,373,agent_2,"for sure ! enineers have created chips to put ijn shoulder players for data purposes , so its a start ."
8168,373,agent_1,"if the can detect breast canvcer , it is a goo dstart . chips are3 cledver , maybe clever enough to spread pink awareness ."
8169,373,agent_2,"hve you been afected by brseast cancer ? you sound li,e a good advocate"
8170,373,agent_1,i thank gos that i haven't been . i wore the rbeawst protectors while i plaed and have not suffereed like s many otners .
8171,373,agent_2,"i am happy to hear that . speaking lof women , did you know they could play in the nfl if they were good enough ?"
8172,373,agent_1,i think that would incur a tremenfous risk of breast cancer on their part . they should taek care to avoid that risk . carcinogens abound in pro football .
8173,373,agent_2,i agree as wel l. do you watch espn ?
8174,373,agent_1,"they are the ons taht came up wuth the p9nk line to rause awareenss about b4east cancer , right ?"
8175,373,agent_2,"yellow line on tv , but pink during october i believe , good chattign with you !"
8176,374,agent_1,hey there ! do you like football ?
8177,374,agent_2,"i'm bot nuhc into sports in general , however , i did watch quit ea bit when i was younger . do you like football ?"
8178,374,agent_1,"not so much , but i know some interesting facts about football and the nfl ! for example , i juzt learne da little wile ago that u of iowa's lock3r room for visiting folotball teams is painted pink !"
8179,374,agent_2,"that's surprising to me ! i woder if it has to do with school colors ? or , do you think it was previously the 2omen's locker room ?"
8180,374,agent_1,"i think it probably was meant to e a joke , sicne pink is typically thojght to be a ' feminin e' color . however , ik ind of like the idea of football and pink ! breaking down gender norms !"
8181,374,agent_2,"agreed ! i was fascinated to learn that the nfl actually allows female players , if they meet teh league's leigibility . wonder if any have tried out ?"
8182,374,agent_1,"i have no idea . i'm guessing not prohably just because of stigma , unfortunately . but props to the nfl q i defjnitely think we need to see more ladies playing football !"
8183,374,agent_2,"yes ! i h4ar dthat many people were actually rooting against brady'?s team , because they're jind of over them wqinning all the time . he sre works har dthough , it seems ."
8184,374,agent_1,"i think so , too . but there awre othe rgood players as well . i guess rb benjarvys greenellis has never fumbled th4 football in his nfl career ."
8185,374,agent_2,"pretty impressivd . i know they get paid a lot for htose skills , but id you realize that top bowelrs in the 60's madet wice as much as football stars then ?"
8186,374,agent_1,i ad no idea ! that's quite interesting . i wonder why . . . any ideas ?
8187,374,agent_2,the only thing i can come up with is that bowling was more popular because ot had been arlound ;onger ?
8188,374,agent_1,"probably . i think a ot of things were more popular back then . diners , roller skating , church , the bible . . . thingsl ike that ."
8189,374,agent_2,"good point . funny that you mentioned theb ible , as ir ecently learned that jefferson used a razor to cut outs upernatural parts of theb ible ."
8190,374,agent_1,"s weird ! i mean , i guess thins were just different back then . i guess before 1963 , rvery student was required to read the bible 2hen they were na elemetnary student ."
8191,374,agent_2,"wow , that just woukd cause such a nuproar today . funnu how what society approves of changes in such a relatively short timeframe ."
8192,374,agent_1,"i guess not everyoen was super religious , though . apparently roosevelt and john quincy adams didn't use the bible at their swearingin ceremonies ."
8193,374,agent_2,very interest8ing . did y9u aso know that the tower of babel is probably based ob ar eal buildint in iraq ?
8194,374,agent_1,"hmm , dod not know that ! but it makess ense . even though times are changing , i guess the bible is still the bestselling boo kof all time ."
8195,374,agent_2,"yeag , but i bet tom brady hopes his bookw ill surpass tha t!"
8196,374,agent_1,"and i hope for his sake , taht it might !t his conversation was enlightening . enjoy your night !"
8197,374,agent_2,thank you too !
8198,374,agent_1,maybe i'll start watching the fnl more often now !
8199,374,agent_2,me too .
8200,375,agent_1,"hi thewre , do yhou watch the nfl ?"
8201,375,agent_2,nfl ? yhe national footbal lleague ? j don't know much baout it . you ?
8202,375,agent_1,yeah i watch it quite a bit . eid you know u of iowa painted their visito rlocker room pink ?
8203,375,agent_2,i heard about that . i wonder if it effective a tall . other teams ould probalby do the same if it worked .
8204,375,agent_1,yeah eactly that is a good poin6 . did you know there are only 11 minutes of active game play ?
8205,375,agent_2,that is so little ! i guess the6 is a lot of swtting up and moving the chains and stuff .
8206,375,agent_1,yeah exactly it . do you know hat the highest score in cllebef ootball game is ?
8207,375,agent_2,i imagien it cojuld get quite high . probably from long ago .
8208,375,agent_1,yeah it was 2220 when georiga tech beat cumberland
8209,375,agent_2,"that seems unfair . a lot about football seems unfair . for example , new orleans saints cheerleaders can't eat in the samer estaurant as any nfl player . if they are already dining at a restaurant and an nfl player comes in after , the cheerleaders are required to leave ."
8210,375,agent_1,"tha tis so wrong and ssexist , i cannot believe they still hav ethat rule . did you know esp nwon an emmy once ?"
8211,375,agent_2,i believe it . espn has been aeoudn for a long tiem . they should have won at least once .
8212,375,agent_1,yeah they have and they won it for the superimposed yell3 line
8213,375,agent_2,for a l8ne on the screen ? that seems a bit too simple to deserve an award .
8214,375,agent_1,yeah i know butt hey gor it after all . do you know who benjarvus greenellis is ?
8215,375,agent_2,never heard of him . is he fmous ? what does he do ?
8216,375,agent_1,yeah eh is a former qb who never fumbled thd ball in his caree5r
8217,375,agent_2,wow . impressive . never ? i guess every defenser must have bern coming arter him . i hope he got a raise or a bonus or something .
8218,375,agent_1,i hope so too honestly . tyhere seems to be no rule that prevents women from playing in the nlf
8219,375,agent_2,"the rule might not be tbere , but i think theb aer is still very high physically . anywag , tbanks for the chat !"
8220,375,agent_1,"same here , have a great one ."
8221,376,agent_1,hi . do you like football ?
8222,376,agent_2,i have a passing knowledge
8223,376,agent_1,same here . the highest scoring gamee ver was 2220 ! that kust have been something to watch !
8224,376,agent_2,euther hte winning team was jus tthat good or thje losibng team was njust that bad
8225,376,agent_1,or both ! did you kmow in the nflt hey only play for around 11 minutes per gam e?
8226,376,agent_2,ya . that sure is a lot of action in so littlet ime
8227,376,agent_1,"there are no 5rules against women in ten fl , i wonder if we will see fhat anytime soon ?"
8228,376,agent_2,perhaps the reson why we don't see them now is because the requirements inherently disqualify most ?
8229,376,agent_1,"you're probably right . some of teh league still has sexist rules about cheerleaders , though , not allowing them to eat in the same restaurant as the players !"
8230,376,agent_2,i wonder why . i seems unfairlyb iased
8231,376,agent_1,"yeah , it's a strange rule . did you watcnh the playoffs and super bowl this year ?"
8232,376,agent_2,the opening was a bit disappoint9ng compared to years ;prior
8233,376,agent_1,ueah . the playoffs were nerve wrecking to me due to fumbles and such . did you know tnere is a player who neve rfumbled the bal lhis whole career ?
8234,376,agent_2,then you must like green ellis
8235,376,agent_1,"yeah . talk about pressure not o mess up your record , though ! speaking of recors , i can't believe the patrioys have won 6 out kf 8 super bowls ! that's prerty amazing"
8236,376,agent_2,that is why they are like the lanister5s of football
8237,376,agent_1,"between brady and their coach who has won teh most playogff gakes ever , no other team as a shot ."
8238,376,agent_2,that is not to mention that the team is fu7ll of 6alent like prevkously green ellis
8239,376,agent_1,very true . brady has develpefd a mwthod called the tb12 nethod that teaches people ' how to live oike tom ' . it's been nicec hatting with you . hae a great eeekend !
8240,376,agent_2,i agrre . the same to you as well l
8241,376,agent_1,thank you !
8242,377,agent_1,"hi , how are you tonight ? do your ead the bible ? did you know that before 1963 , it was not uncommon for us students to be required to read from the bible as part of their elementary education ?"
8243,377,agent_2,i actually do read it and know that . i'm guessing that tradition ebded aroun dfthe time oeople protested about porayer in schools
8244,377,agent_1,"that wlud mkae sense . separation of church and state . speaking of which , presidents teddy roosevelt and john quincy adams did not use a bible at their swearingin ceremonies . i think they swore on the constitution ."
8245,377,agent_2,interesting . yet ther ecent ones hve all sworn on the bible
8246,377,agent_1,"yes , i thin kthe fraditio nis important in today's political climate . in colonial times it was different . thomqs jefferson created his own version of the bible . cuttin gout hte s'upernatural' parts , such as the miracle sand the resu4rectio n.h e wanted to see religion in h7manis tterms ."
8247,377,agent_2,"whicuh probably did more damage in the end to himself . it would be awesome to see the ermeenanki building in p3rson , since many think it's the referenced tower of babel"
8248,377,agent_1,that would make sense . i could see places in the bible having connection to places in the mixdle east .
8249,377,agent_2,it dokes make sens e. it's strange how the root for apple and evil oe from the same word in lati n. that's probably why people assume that eve ate an apple
8250,377,agent_1,"true . easy to get confused . on a different topic , do you follow the nfl ?"
8251,377,agent_2,"i dont' follow it too closely , but i heard tom brady released a boo thath as been dubbed the ' athlete's bible '"
8252,377,agent_1,tha'ts interesting . a bible for athletes . i don't knowm uc habout the book or brady .
8253,377,agent_2,i just know of hiom due to the patrios and their constant winning . do you follow any of the 32 teams in the nf ?
8254,377,agent_1,"i usually follow around the playoffs , if at all . i don't have much time to watch . do you have a chanc e?"
8255,377,agent_2,wer'e in the same boat with the playodfs aspect . i can't keep up on 16 games in the 4egular season l but i can do a few gmes and the super bowl
8256,377,agent_1,thw playoffs seem to hav more energy . i figure it'e the time to pay attnetion . an average nfl game only has 11 minutes of live gameplay . i wonder what the total fo rthe season is .
8257,377,agent_2,considering that 32 teams play for 16 weeks notc ounting the single eliminatikn playoff gqmes including the wildcards . . . that's mat hi don't want to do
8258,377,agent_1,"nfl uses trackign chips in players shoulder pads to record a player's moves on the field . they are aslo located inside footballs to track : velocity , rotation , ball speed and location . i wonder how much data that generates per seaso n."
8259,377,agent_2,"if they're smar tenough to crsate the chips , therde must e syste,ms in place to keep track o fit all . hopefully the engineers who came up with that ar4e the3 ones making more than nfl players in their comparabl elifetimes"
8260,377,agent_1,i hope so too . we need engineers more than we nerd athletes if we're going to have a good sciety .
8261,377,agent_2,true ! althiugh it is pretty cool that there isn't a rule that keeps women from playing . all tuey need to do it meet eligibility
8262,377,agent_1,"i guess in the future we might see a woman . anyway , great chat ! have a great evening !"
8263,377,agent_2,that woukd be an interesting game !
8264,378,agent_1,"who is one of your favorite quarterb, s? mine is peyton manning but i will have to say tom brady is a close second . he is amazing !"
8265,378,agent_2,bhave respect for both those guys they are great qbs but im a steeler fan so i gue3ss my favorite is ben right now .
8266,378,agent_1,did ouh ea rthat tom brady wrote ab ook . i heard it isd like the ' athlete's bible ' if tyere is such a thing .
8267,378,agent_2,i di dhear that . i think it was just a publicity stnt . a wa6 to makew more money .
8268,378,agent_1,i think h eis tryingt o start something before he retires that he can contine . . . not like he needs the money .
8269,378,agent_2,i guess maybe thats the case . i just dont see an athletes bible being something substantia l. just a jocks view .
8270,378,agent_1,i agree . i mean6 he average nfl game only has 11 minutes of live gameplay . not as much as everyone thought .
8271,378,agent_2,yeah there iks a l.ot of waiting around the tv for tbe next play . those 11 minutes are3 prrtty exciting though .
8272,378,agent_1,"i ageee ! ! did you know that the nfl uses tracking chips to record speed , otation of the ball and so many other things ."
8273,378,agent_2,yeah they evne put them in the players shoulder oads . technology is everywhere i guess .
8274,378,agent_1,kind of scary ! just likeb eing a enw orleans saintsc heerkeader . if they are in a restaurant and a nfl player comes in they have to leave . thzat is not right !
8275,378,agent_2,no it snot . i dont see why that uls should be in ;place . i can se3 a rule about them not dating ors omething liket hat but hot allowed to be in the same place at the same time . i dont get it .
8276,378,agent_1,i don't either and i think it is over he top . even the nfl has no written rule against female plahyers as long as they met the eligibility requirdments .
8277,378,agent_2,"i have heard that .w hat ppsition would a woman want to play though ? only the top . 001 percent of men are gifted enough to play in the nfl so when a woman comes alon gwho wants to play too , she' sgoing to be really fita nd ready"
8278,378,agent_1,it would be hard ! ! look aw oman would probably be better off being an engineer . their average lifetime earnings are higher than the aversge lifetime earmings of an nfl player and mlb player !
8279,378,agent_2,thats pretty surprising to hear . i know their are a lot of p.ayers that dont make it that bring that average down . i just figured the top earners making 20 plusm illion a year would p0ut the nfl players over the top in that category .
8280,378,agent_1,you would think ! i heard even 190's top bowleras made twice as much as football stara !
8281,378,agent_2,i believe that . bowling was a big sport back in the day ? football playere didnt have th eplayers union back then so they didnt jaek nearly what they deserved . i would zay now it is a little over the top though .
8282,378,agent_1,i agree . especially if you are like the patriots benjarvus greenellis who never even fumbled one game in his nfl caree .
8283,378,agent_2,he mkust have done a lot of upper body strength trainingt o be strong enough to enver fumble . either that or ne prayed hard every night .
8284,378,agent_1,i agree ! ! hope you have a greatf night !
8285,379,agent_1,"hello , how are you doung ?"
8286,379,agent_2,"i am well . i hope you are als ! hey , do know anything about tom brady's new book , the tb12 method ?"
8287,379,agent_1,tom brady ? is he an autho ?
8288,379,agent_2,"of sorts . . . he is best known as the longtime qb of the new england patriots footballt eam . but he is often regarded s one ogt he greatest qbs the game has ever had . he is still going strong at 40 yrs old , and he has written a book explainingh is approach to stay at the top of his game ."
8289,379,agent_1,i tsounds like an imporant book . have you read it ? i would like to hear more .
8290,379,agent_2,"i hav3e not read it yet , but i am very much interested i getting a copy . i am not one of those new egnland patriot fanst hat deify brady and his coac h, belichick , or consider the patriots my religion , but i do admire anyone that ha sperformed at the top of their sport for so many years . 6 nfl championshipsd is incredible ."
8291,379,agent_1,that is incredible . he is practically a deity . i guess he hna searned his status in the heavens . the book is a hoy tract .
8292,379,agent_2,"i understand what 8dolatry is , and i do not approach that level of religious zeal . i merely thing the phrase , ' in bil, we trust ' which is a mantra or creed spoeon ofen in boston is an ezrned sentimen t."
8293,379,agent_1,"that is good . it is important to remain humble and true . there is only on egill and tom , but there is a higehr authority ."
8294,379,agent_2,my wife . . . lol thomas nefferson mayh ave created his own version of the bible ; but my wife would consider herself editor .
8295,379,agent_1,th3e bible did not need editing . i don't know what he was thinking . he must have spent too much time wth the women he owned .
8296,379,agent_2,nice . i agree on the lakc of need for editing the bble . i was also jestihg regarding my wife . if ind it sad that teddy roosevelt and john quincy adams chose tk not use3 the bible at their inaugurations .
8297,379,agent_1,"i think that ted and john ha danpther agenda , one not paralle lto the one set in the bible ."
8298,379,agent_2,what is yourt hinking on the apocrypha ? do you find any value to these works as complementary to the canonical bible ?
8299,379,agent_1,the wo0rd is broad and varied and it is good to look in places that others have shunned . we do not know th ecomplete truth bdcause it is hidden .
8300,379,agent_2,"we see through a glass dcimly . . . but i find it interesting every time archeologists find another site consistent with biblical texts . in act , they think the tower of babel was based on a real building pocated inw hat is modern day iraq ?. interesting ."
8301,379,agent_1,i think that is an intedresting connection that help people recognoze the value of the texts .
8302,379,agent_2,"yes , and likewise , the documented histkric perforkance of tom brady in his long , rcordsetting career in hte nfl helps people to recognize the value o his writings ."
8303,379,agent_1,i think that his fame and notoriety can only help spread what must be a valuable insight in the huma ncondition .
8304,379,agent_2,"and it helps to sell books . although brady does not seemed strapped for cash . . . th eaverage nfl playerd oes nof earn as much in a career as an averzage negineer , but brady is an exception"
8305,379,agent_1,brady is an exception that the engieners envy . htank you for the chat . good night .
8306,379,agent_2,good nivght and ay the ball always roll your way q
8307,380,agent_1,"are you a tom rbady fan , he plays for the patriots ?"
8308,380,agent_2,"i cant say that i am , but i respect his talent ."
8309,380,agent_1,"yeah apparently his work ethic is off the charts . he does however c,aim that football has become his religion ."
8310,380,agent_2,"i heard about the tb12 , and the in bill we trust that a lot of fans follow ."
8311,380,agent_1,"i know what happen to just plain old talent nd sprtsmanshkp . one quote said that brady was kind of a messiah figure . if it's not blasphemy , it's too cloe to it !"
8312,380,agent_2,"i know ! people idplize him ; i dont hear too muh negative about him , he seems to toe the line in terms of his behavior . bt he is no messiah ."
8313,380,agent_1,rigbht ! hey did you know that top bowlers in the 60's made more than top nfl players ?
8314,380,agent_2,that is crazy . i wonder how much that was at that time . now they ards jre overpid .
8315,380,agent_1,personally i think mos tsports players are over paid . that money could be taxed to pay for healthcare .
8316,380,agent_2,"i agree . especially for only 11 minutes of live game playe ahc week ,"
8317,380,agent_1,i know that's crazy to think about . i didn't know that espn won an emmy award .
8318,380,agent_2,"neither did i , and all for that yellow ine . i thought it would take al ittle ore than that to win an emmy , but im not the judge ."
8319,380,agent_1,i know but i have to say that line made life a little easier . a former patriots rb hdver fumbledt he ball in his entirec areer .
8320,380,agent_2,he is probably responsible for the huge successes that the patriots have had rece3btly .
8321,380,agent_1,maybe ins ome way . did you know there was a college gmae were the score was 2200 ?
8322,380,agent_2,"i had heard that , georgia tech and cumberlan ."
8323,380,agent_1,wow that's crazy i can not imagine even sittin gthrough that game let alone playing in it . you know thjere n rule that says women can't pkay in the nfl ?
8324,380,agent_2,"yeah , they say ws long as they can meet the eligibility requirements they are allowe dto . whatever those are . i xont think id want to play in the nfl , i dont want to be crushec by a luneman ."
8325,380,agent_1,right if they do it i think they should create a league like the wnba .
8326,380,agent_2,that wodl be interesting to watch . i hope if a female did make it to the nfl tehy would treat her better than the cheerleaders .
8327,380,agent_1,i think they should have all male cheerleaders for the wnfl ! what do you think ?
8328,380,agent_2,"i like i t! thete are a few for the nfl now , but an all male sqad would be gret ! it has been nice chatting but i must go . have a good day !"
8329,381,agent_1,"hi ,d o you know anything about the new ebglahnd patriots and tom brady ?"
8330,381,agent_2,"i know that tom brady has a best selling book called ' the tb12 method ' , have you heard of it or read it ?"
8331,381,agent_1,"no , but i heard it is an inspiration to us ll . did you know that brady's coac h, beneke worries about the devotion to te patriots might overshadow other kins of faith in some people ?"
8332,381,agent_2,what ? because there ate so many fans 9f the patriots ?
8333,381,agent_1,"no , bscause on sudays in new england people are devoted to watchign the patriots and talking about the teamj even in church ."
8334,381,agent_2,"oh ! wow , even when fhere's only eleven minutes of live gameplay , there's so much chatter nonstop aeound the game ! i also devote sn ent5ire sunday to watching the games ! do you weatch the games"
8335,381,agent_1,"no , not on tv but i heard that some patriots try to keep their focuz on faith i god rather than on the tea on sundays ."
8336,381,agent_2,that's good ! i wonder if those people wished that reading the bible was part of the education curriculum like rior to 160s
8337,381,agent_1,"that could be . hte patriots do have a number ofs piritual players like matthee slater who's known for his offfield evangleism . slater adn other patriots will be feature din football sunday , a national chrchbased event on super bowl sunday ."
8338,381,agent_2,"oh i didn't know that . i wonder if there will be as many people tuned in compared t how many copies there has been sold of the bible , a whopping 5 billion copies !"
8339,381,agent_1,"probably not that many since the 5 billion copy estimate has to do with from the beginning of it's printing , ha , ha . besides that , another patriots fan and hte pastor of richmond community church in glen allen , va . say that there are faith lessons in brady's examples he uses in hi sbook ."
8340,381,agent_2,"oh o, , yeah five bilion copies is a lot ! do you know what thpe or fait lessons there are ?"
8341,381,agent_1,"well , according to mcdaniel , brady's commitment to his craft allow3d him to overcome the oddx . brady's career began as a sixthroundd raft pick and now is arguably the best at his craft ."
8342,381,agent_2,"his story is freally worth a r4ead , i wonder if they dpict that in the documentary ' tom vs . time ' , have you seeh it ;"
8343,381,agent_1,"no , i haven't seen it yet butt hat will probaby be the main focu si would think . brady coming up from the bottom to the top . actually , he's shown the ability to rebound from adversitf quite nicely ."
8344,381,agent_2,"yeah my friend has seen it and he told me it changed his perspective on hte guy . he's actually a verhy hardworking nice guy and really puts in a lot of hard work to the game , the team , anf his fans . i wonder if they will get an emmy like what espn won fort he yel.low line used in football games ."
8345,381,agent_1,"that might happen o reven ebtter things . remember last year when the patriots were down 28 to 3 in 6he super bowl and then they came back to win the game in overtiem , that was spectacular ."
8346,381,agent_2,"oh my , that was sych a great game ! i was sitting on the edge of my seat the entire tme , i wonder if that's why i was so disappintexd in this year'd game . i think people who placed bets on the game would've preferred the boring game thoug h."
8347,381,agent_1,"yes , that's probalby true , save the blood pressute and all that . but really , brady is a great example of what you can do if you're really committed . it serms tat brady is totally committedt o his tb12 method and he is reallys incere ."
8348,381,agent_2,"yeah , that's the message i'm getting as well . do you know what the 12 stands for in the tb12 ?"
8349,381,agent_1,"it wuld think ig means 12 methods like the title shows because he's talking abiut a number of areas . in axdition to spiritual beliefs , he's ytalking about good nutrition , fitness , and list of othera ttributes to maintain his lifestyle ."
8350,382,agent_1,hello ! are you a fan of tom brady ?
8351,382,agent_2,"i wouldn't cdall myself a fan , but i respect ghim as one of the greats . he's in such great health to be in the league as long as he has been ."
8352,382,agent_1,i agree . i didn'yt like him until i watched his documentary tom vs time . i became a big fan after watching that . it shows how much work he puts into his craft .
8353,382,agent_2,iv'e heard of the documejtary but have never watched it . i liked watching the pateiots when bnejarvus greenellis played for him . he waw a solid running back and actually has nevr fumbled the football in hisn fl career !
8354,382,agent_1,"thats' incredilbe ! dkd you know they put tracking chips in the footballs to trakc the data such as velocity , etc . on them ?"
8355,382,agent_2,8 did not know that . that's probably why plsayers get fined so much for throwing them into that stands . i heard that they laseo hacve tracking chips embedded in the players shoulder pads to recvord they're every move .
8356,382,agent_1,crazy how the game has come along technology wise . i wish the actual gameplay was lnger htoug h.t here's only 11 minutes of actual gameplay 9n an average nfl gamd ;
8357,382,agent_2,"i know , that seems so short . it's 2 hours and 49 minutes of crap .t hey should get some womnet o plzy , teh could mak3e gameplay last longer . i mean there's no rules against them playing ."
8358,382,agent_1,i agree ! the average li9fetime earnings of sn engineer is highe rthan the average nfl adn mbl players . that's surprising .
8359,382,agent_2,"it is pretty surprising , but i guess you have to consider that most enginee4s work well into their 60s or evej 70s . the average football palyer only play sfor 3 years ."
8360,382,agent_1,true . i wonder if other people outdide of the u . s . get confused whent hey hear football since that's the word they use toc all soccer .
8361,382,agent_2,i think a lot do . it just feeld weird bhaving o specify . although gridiron football has an ice ring to it .
8362,382,agent_1,yes it does . i nhte 1960's top bowlers made tice as much as the top tootball stars of that era . thingas have changed since then .
8363,382,agent_2,ysh htey have . that's weird to think . did you know that iowa's visiting locker room is cmpletely painted pink . i wonder how many times that has backfired on them ?
8364,382,agent_1,lol . maybe they did it to support breast cnacer awareneas ?
8365,382,agent_2,"that would b ea good excs3 . i heard that espn won an emmy for the creation of the yellow first down line , that was an emmy well won ."
8366,382,agent_1,interesting ! the highest score eger in a football gqames wzs in 1916 when georgia tech beat cumberlanx2 220 !
8367,382,agent_2,"thqt's crazy , u wonder ift hats' when gedorgia tech learned the triple option and it's effectivenes ."
8368,382,agent_1,not sure ! how many teams are there in the nfl ?
8369,382,agent_2,"i believe i'ts 32 ,"
8370,382,agent_1,thanks ! i wasnt sure . nicec hatting with you today !
8371,382,agent_2,it was nice cyatting with you too . have a great day !
8372,383,agent_1,"hi there , do you watch the nfl ?"
8373,383,agent_2,"yes i do . i enjoyed the superbowl , and watching brady qnd company winn their sixth nfl chmapioship"
8374,383,agent_1,"ys me too , i liket hat . did you know brady has written a book now as well ?"
8375,383,agent_2,ia that he tb12 method ?
8376,383,agent_1,"yes and taht is also his lifestyle brand and there seems to be a documentary in the works , tom vs time"
8377,383,agent_2,"oh , yeah , is that the facebook seies ?"
8378,383,agent_1,"yes htat one . eo you know waht his favorie ice cream flavour is , as a fun fact ?"
8379,383,agent_2,i don't . some kind ofv egan somethihg i imagine ?
8380,383,agent_1,"ia m not sure about i tbeing vegan but the flzavfor is avocado , still pretty healthy"
8381,383,agent_2,"nice . i undrwtan dthat he is on a spiritual quest of some sort , ws he dedicates himself to his craft ."
8382,383,agent_1,yes it seems that way . did you know women can play in the nfl ?
8383,383,agent_2,"yeah , i guess tere is no rule against them , but they still have to meet eligibility 4equiremejnts ."
8384,383,agent_1,"youn ever know i guess , time will tell . did you hear about them usin tracking chips on 5the players while in the field ?"
8385,383,agent_2,"i knew they track he balls , byt they track players too ?"
8386,383,agent_1,yes it is ij their shoulder pars and they are track9ng stuff like velocity and rotation and such
8387,383,agent_2,seems like al ot of expense for a game where the average playtime is only 11 minutes per game .
8388,383,agent_1,"yeah it sure does . on another topc , do you know much about the bibel ?"
8389,383,agent_2,"i do , althoufh i ahve more knowledge of the new testament , less of the old , and even less of 5he apocrypha . you ?"
8390,383,agent_1,oh i see . i do not know much but just some facts . i know that it is one of the most influential boosk in history and spld 5 billion copies so far
8391,383,agent_2,"it used to be common for school children to read from the bible . thesr dzys , lawsuits have curbed that ."
8392,383,agent_1,yes that is true . it seems jefferson creaed nis own version of the bibel .
8393,384,agent_1,good morning .
8394,384,agent_2,good morning ! are you a football fan ?
8395,384,agent_1,yeah i am . how bout you . i read somewhere that the nfl has no rule agains female player . what do you think abojt thaqt .
8396,384,agent_2,"well some colleges have female kickers already , so that seems reasonable . i havew to admit htat i really only watch the superbowl . my hushand and son aren' really interested m, so its just not on in ou rhouse ."
8397,384,agent_1,i watch every sunday . im a steelsrs fan . my wife roots for the patriots just to pick on me . lol . i think a female could probably be a kicker or a punter in hte nfl . im nbot sure about any other positions .
8398,384,agent_2,"my husband liked the steelers oin college . the patriots , though . . . no . there's a ew documentary about tom brady and ho whe combines football and religjon ."
8399,384,agent_1,i juzt dont ee how the two mix to b honest . exscept they both take place on sunday .
8400,384,agent_2,"lol . , i actually laughed out loud , by the way ! , i'vse heard that after he retire sfrom football he may be planning some kind of ministry that is combined wth nutrition nad exercise . s columnst at the bostojn globe called kit a cult !"
8401,384,agent_1,"i can see the importaance of staying phtsically fit . ij ust d9nt think it should be3 mixrd with religion . i think he is just trying to ake so,e extra money off his popularity ."
8402,384,agent_2,"that seems likely . we often think of nfl players as making lots of , but their careers are very short . the average lifetime earnings of an engineer are actually much hgher than that of an nfl o rmlb player ."
8403,384,agent_1,yeah but thoe number are just of the average player . most players dont play very long and dont make a whole lot of money in football when you think about a lifetime . thy only a play a year and make like haqlf a kilion dollars . an engineer has to wokr his whole life for that . i think you would be btter of fto play football and then finish school to be a engineer .
8404,384,agent_2,"given the high rates of tce , i'll takd the lifetime as a nengineer any day . it'd weird how much trauma there is i nsuch a short time on the field . did you know that the average nfl gmae has only 11 mintes of actual gtame play ?"
8405,384,agent_1,i did hear that . thos 11 minutes are exciting htoubh .
8406,384,agent_2,"yeah . also , an engineer would make half w million dollars in 58 years , so that's not too shabby . esp3ecially when you consider that the football player and the engineer both had to go to college anyway before they gott heir respective jobs ."
8407,384,agent_1,"that is trude , but if you become one of the greats in football . you will be rememberd forever . not to many engineers can say that ."
8408,384,agent_2,"well , some people in your own country might 3ememebr ou forever , i guess . gridiron footbal,l is mostly played in tue us . i remember whe nmy parednts lived in englandtf or af ew years and they were really surprised to lesrn tha tmuch of hte rest of the world doesn't ws5ch it ."
8409,384,agent_1,yeah the rest of the worl takes soccer very seriously . they actually call it football . i
8410,384,agent_2,that's true . sme places like australiw use teh word ' football ' for rugby .
8411,384,agent_1,i dont know mnuch about rugby . i knlw the ball the use is similiar to the america football .
8412,384,agent_2,"yeah , me neither . my kid's school has a team , but i've never sene them play ;"
8413,384,agent_1,maybe wfter that you could take me out to dinner and yo7u can tell me all about the life of a nobleman .
8414,384,agent_2,"um , wow , tht's . . . random ! nice talking to you !"
8415,384,agent_1,accident . sorry about5 that . trying to do two things at once . lol . have a good one .
8416,385,agent_1,"do you have knowledge of ho tom brady eat s, exercises and rests ?"
8417,385,agent_2,i do not . i would imagine that he has a pretty intenser egimen .
8418,385,agent_1,tehre ws a tv special that claims thst football is his religion and so he lives esvery day to be able to continu eto play a long time . he is now 40 .
8419,385,agent_2,i expect that he will retire in the next few years then . i heard that he wrote a book called the tb12 method . have you heard of it ?
8420,385,agent_1,"yes . i have . of courae hks wife is into the healthy eating lifestyle too . deepak chopra di dhte tv series . i don'tk now neough abo7ut him to feel positive or negative , but i lean negative ."
8421,385,agent_2,i do too . mostly because of the cheating . are you a football fan ?
8422,385,agent_1,"i really follow college footbalo , i went to oklahoma and follow that team . i love the yellow line that espn invented to sow the line to gai nfor a first down ."
8423,385,agent_2,ih eard they won an emmy for tha . can you imagine watching a game without that line ?
8424,385,agent_1,"not anymore . globally , a lot of different games are considered to be footbal l."
8425,385,agent_2,that is true . i'm referring to american football in thisc qse . do 6ou know what hte highest score in a footballg am eever was ?
8426,385,agent_1,"well , my jv team was beaten by anothdr varsity team by 740 , and oklahoma beay texas a and m 770 once ."
8427,385,agent_2,wow ! those are extremely high scoring games . the higheste ver was in 1916 and it was 2220 ! how is that 3even possible ?
8428,385,agent_1,"i cannot imagien . in the two games i mentioned , they did not stop the clock in thew second half to shorten the game . hwave you heard that the iowa visitor'z dressing room is painted pink ."
8429,385,agent_2,i did not . is that supposed to be soem kind of psychological game ?
8430,385,agent_1,there have been studies that prkv ethat weight lifters cannot lift as much in a pink room . so it isd another move to wib games .
8431,385,agent_2,wow ! i have never heard of that . very interesting . do you remember the patriots rb benjarvus greenellis ?
8432,385,agent_1,i don't . was he distinctive ?
8433,385,agent_2,yes he nevwr fumbled a footbal lhis entire caree r!
8434,385,agent_1,that is a distincton ! there are3 2 geqms in hte nfl so it is amazing to have that d8stinction .
8435,385,agent_2,i agree . did you also know that i nthe 60's top bowlers made more than top football players ?
8436,385,agent_1,"the nfl has xoe a great job of marketing ti increase their incomes . there are 54 players on each tema and 32t eams , so now over 150 0people probaboy make more than the top bowlers . nice chat ."
8437,386,agent_1,a4e you into tom brady ?
8438,386,agent_2,"can't say that i am , i know of him and what he does , but that is about it ."
8439,386,agent_1,he has a book out called ' athlete's bible ' . manh are making comments about it bein gspiritulaly involved .
8440,386,agent_2,it seems diffcult to equate spirituality wkth footblal . they sem opposite to mr .
8441,386,agent_1,it's mainly th efans that saee brady as a messiah and coac hbelichick as some kind of deiyy . the say ' in bill we trust ' .
8442,386,agent_2,i know some people take itt oo far . when you have fans it's amazinhg what you can sell to them . if mr brady sold avocado ice cream wjth his face on the front they'd think it was the best lfavore ver .
8443,386,agent_1,"taht deasn't sound good . bob ryan , a former columnist , said that it was ' cultlike ' ."
8444,386,agent_2,"sme celebrities believe that just because they are good at one thing , in this case football , it makes t5hey experts on everything , and they want to tell us how o behave ."
8445,386,agent_1,"i agree , thawg is annoying . i mainly like college football . my alma mater ran up 6he score on cumberland 2220 in 1916 . hot terribly proud of that . . ."
8446,386,agent_2,if i were on yhe losing side i think i would have give nup playing . maybe they could have turned to the bible .
8447,386,agent_1,"maybe . at least c7umberlnd proabbly didn't have a pin klocker room like tjat kf u . of iowa . in 1916 , they probbly dind't have a locke rroom at all ."
8448,386,agent_2,"i don't think they weth in for those silly games back then , probably more respectful to the other team ."
8449,386,agent_1,probably . . . did you know the nfl had no written rule that women cant' play ;?
8450,386,agent_2,"they probsbly think they don't need it . some guys get workd up if 5hey hear a womah is go9ng to take part in somethin g, but if they are good enough and want to do it let them ."
8451,386,agent_1,"i agree . it's not that b8ig of a deal . here's another interesting footbaol fact , there are only1 1 actual minutes of gamepaly in an average nfl game ."
8452,386,agent_2,"i never really enjoyerd watching footba;l . i think that might be the main reason , i don't have time to sit in front of the tv for trhee hours for just 11 minute sof ply ."
8453,386,agent_1,k like documentaries . i would like to see one about finding thet ower of babel in iraq .
8454,386,agent_2,"my mental image of that is a very tall building , if it existed it was probablt a lot smaller than i'm htining ."
8455,386,agent_1,"it's probab.y a bunhc of rubble du4 to recent bombings . it's interesting that thomas jefferson cut ot the parts in his bibel that refsrred to the ' supernatural ' , e . g . , miealces , ."
8456,386,agent_2,i've heard that before . i'd ove to see a copy . must just have looked like a shredded book . funny thing to do .
8457,386,agent_1,"yeah , i'd like to ehar more about his reasoning . thahnks for the chat ; you were excellent ."
8458,387,agent_1,had to believe that the pwtriots just wo nthe super bowl agai n. i wonder how tom brady is still so good given hi sage .
8459,387,agent_2,"good morning , i love tom brady ,h e's like the energizer bunny , he just keeps going and goinb and bgoing . . . lol didn't realize he was so spiritual , did you ?"
8460,387,agent_1,i thought football was his religion . at least that's what his friend gotham chopra says .
8461,387,agent_2,"well , he said in av ersion o fthe spiritual episeode , that hed oss wnat to know why we're here , where we're gong , trying to find that deeper purpose . tht's pretty spiritial tom e ."
8462,387,agent_1,i guess you're right . have y7ou read tom's bolk ' the tb12 method ' ?
8463,387,agent_2,"no , have you ?"
8464,387,agent_1,yeah i have . i'ts very interesting tuff . not sure how he can enjoy avocado ice cream though . i find it kn of gross .
8465,387,agent_2,"ooh , that soundss o grose ! do you watch ,uch football ?"
8466,387,agent_1,iw atc hit most weekends . i prefer the fnl to college footbal lor any other league .
8467,387,agent_2,"i was shocked to find out that an average nfl game , only has1 1 minutes of live gameplay ."
8468,387,agent_1,thbey do keep the time runninv while the teams are setting up and callig a new play a lo seo i guess i'ts not too surprising . they still earn a lot of monry for the little work they do .
8469,387,agent_2,how true . i read somewhere that the top bowlers in the 1960s made twice as much as the top football stars .
8470,387,agent_1,"that shows how quickly things can change . mosg pro football players don't have lon careers , i wonder how much they make compared to other professions over their lifetime ."
8471,387,agent_2,"well , i also read that average lifetime earnings of an rngineer is higher than the average lifetime earning sof an aveage nfl player ."
8472,387,agent_1,that's pretty interesting . do you rea dthe bible much or are you not religiois ?
8473,387,agent_2,i try to read a littel every night before bed . a habit my grandma taught me whge ni was a kid . do you ?
8474,387,agent_1,i read it occasionally . in the 60's it was pretty common fors tudents to be required to reas it . how things change .
8475,387,agent_2,"yes , i htink if we went balc to tha practice , alot 9of thinbs would def be different in america ."
8476,387,agent_1,maybe you're righ t. did you know that thomas jeffewrsobn created his own version of the bible ?
8477,387,agent_2,"yeah , i heard he took a razor and cut out the parts he considerwd ' supernatura ' ."
8478,387,agent_1,that's quite an interesting change to make . it wzs a pleasure talkin gto you . have a great day !
8479,388,agent_1,do you enjoy sports ?
8480,388,agent_2,i don't kinow much about thes ports . do you like the sports ?
8481,388,agent_1,i have a oassing knowledge of football
8482,388,agent_2,i know that passing is used a lot in football . in this youa r ean expert ?
8483,388,agent_1,i wouldn't say expert but i have a basic 8nderstanding
8484,388,agent_2,ok . that is good . i ythinjt hat many peoples in the us like the football . it is a popular game .
8485,388,agent_1,it is surprising how much people invest into it considering each gmae is only aed ozen or so minutes of real action .
8486,388,agent_2,rthey like the action and the violence . it is exciting to see men in combat to the death . the outcomesa re wagered as well it hink .
8487,388,agent_1,"true . it is probably due to injuries that force early retirement that based oin average lifetime earnings , enginees get better paid than players ."
8488,388,agent_2,"engineers muzt be very smart , maybe some og the most smar tpepolple . they earn th3e money for being smkart . i think it is bette rfor life ."
8489,388,agent_1,at leastf ootball players are better paid than bowlers like in the mkd 1900s
8490,388,agent_2,bowlers do noth ave t3h same job risks . i think they should be pqid less .
8491,388,agent_1,tehy ar now
8492,388,agent_2,that i good . is the bible an important part of the foo5tballg ame ?
8493,388,agent_1,are you referring to the aftual bible or the book released by brady ?
8494,388,agent_2,i mean teh ome that everyone has in gheir edroom .
8495,388,agent_1,well i think that it may be since the mental fortitude that comes from religion can bea n important factor of a players performacne
8496,388,agent_2,"i understand . in all life , the strength of the inside helps with the outside ."
8497,388,agent_1,"ondeed . even if you are physically read , if you aen't mentally , that can make all the difference"
8498,388,agent_2,"that is rue . the preparation for4 the football must start inside , then make its way to the outside for the world . thank you for the chatting . if is a good night ."
8499,388,agent_1,same to you .
8500,389,agent_1,"gi there , do you watch the nfl ?"
8501,389,agent_2,"yes i do , what do you think of tom brady ?"
8502,389,agent_1,"i think he is a pretty decent plaer . so was the former qb for patriots , benjarvux"
8503,389,agent_2,i thinkc onsidering how many super bowl rings brady had he is better rha ndecent .
8504,389,agent_1,yeah that is true . benjarvus on the other nand is the only guy in nflt o have never fumbled a ball .
8505,389,agent_2,that is impressive do you know how amny gaems h eplqyed in ?
8506,389,agent_1,"i a mnot sure but ovesr his entire career , 5that must have been quite a few gvames there ."
8507,389,agent_2,"that is ikmpressove , did you know tha tthe average ndl game only has 11 minutes of live play time ?"
8508,389,agent_1,yeah and yet we are glue dto the t vfor houds to watch a single game
8509,389,agent_2,"that is the amazing part , interesting that theyc omplain about how little action there is in baseball ."
8510,389,agent_1,yeah exactly . d9d you hear about them placing tracking ships in the players now ;
8511,389,agent_2,"i was readiny bout that , i wonder if they do that during the game or only practice ."
8512,389,agent_1,i bet you they dk it for both . they need to track lots of stats like velocity and rotation and such and they will likely neerd the averages of those
8513,389,agent_2,w live in amazing times . i can see ywere that would be useful . if a running back is getting tire duringt he game they know righta way
8514,389,agent_1,yeah we sure do . did you know women cabn play to in the nfl ?
8515,389,agent_2,i have reda dabout a couple but overall i just don't think it's a good idea .
8516,389,agent_1,i would be curiois to see that happen . i guess time will tell . did you know about that weird rule for the new orleans cheerleaders ?
8517,389,agent_2,"no , i hadn't heard about that , please tell me ."
8518,389,agent_1,well they are not allowd to eat in the same restaurant zs the players
8519,389,agent_2,np kidding . i guess may be they don't want them to get too clpse or something .
8520,389,agent_1,"maybe but still , the wost is that they have to leave the restaurant mi dmal if the players walk in"
8521,389,agent_2,it seems like that's carrying it a litgle too far .
8522,389,agent_1,it izs not fair at all . i hope they get rid of it soon .
8523,390,agent_1,hello ! wre you a fan of tom bradh ?
8524,390,agent_2,"hi ! i actually am a huge fan ! in fact , i want to follow thet b12 methkod also known as the ' athlete's bible ' so i can be in top shape like he is ! what about you ?"
8525,390,agent_1,k've heard o fit but haven't looked into it . i became a fan of his after watching his ' tom vs . time ' documetnary . have you seen it ?
8526,390,agent_2,"i haven't seen it yet , unfortunately , but i8 do know a litte bit about it . i'm fact , i love what brady says in the first episode : ' if you're going to compete against me , you better be willing o give up your .ife . . m because i'm giving up mie . ' that is powerful !"
8527,390,agent_1,you'll have to watch it . total respect for him seeing howm uch work he puts imto his wok duringt eh offseason . i think you can watch it on facebooi watch .
8528,390,agent_2,i'll definitely do that . it'll help get me by during the nfl offseasons . i can't believe the regular season is only 17 weeks from septebmer to december . i truly flies by !
8529,390,agent_1,ye sit does ! they should lengthen the season by a month anjd hten the 32 teams can get more off weeks dcuring the season .
8530,390,agent_2,"agreed . i mean , surprisonlvy enough , the games are too short as it is seeing as ow the average game is only 11 minutes of live gameplay ."
8531,390,agent_1,i know that's crazh . do you know what the highest football score ever is ?
8532,390,agent_2,it was a game between georgia tech and cumberland abck in 1917 . georgia tech actually son 222o0 . can you imagine seeing that ? wow !
8533,390,agent_1,that must have been a scoe on every play for georgia tech ! lol in the 1960's top bowlers made twice as mucha s top football atars . times have changed since then .
8534,390,agent_2,"so true . but even today , engineers make kore thuan the average lifetime earnigns of both mlb and nfl players ! wonder if they made more tham pro bowlers back tehn ?"
8535,390,agent_1,lo good question . rb benjarvus greenellis never fumbled the ball once durin ghis career . rhat's impressive .
8536,390,agent_2,really ? that takes serious talent and skill ! wonder how he would play if he had to sit int he universikty of iowa's pink painted visiting football teazm's locker room ? hat has to feel insulting . ha !
8537,390,agent_1,lol maybe they did ir to support breast cancer awareenss ?
8538,390,agent_2,"let's hope so ! ha ! on a similar note , women actually aren't forbidden from playing on the nfl as long as they meet the eligibility requirements . wonder why we haven't seen anyf emale players signed by any teams yet ?"
8539,390,agent_1,"i don't know . i'm sure we'll see on hwre in the next few years . did you know they use trackin gchipa inside the footballs to track velocity , rotation , etc . ? htat seems like a bit to much science to me ."
8540,390,agent_2,"ha ! agreed . they also place vchips in the shoulder pads as wel to record the every move of eac player as welpl ! it ish igh tec , right ?"
8541,390,agent_1,crazy ! did you watch the super bowl ? it is usually held on the first sunday in february .
8542,390,agent_2,"i missed it sadly . i was reading the bibl ethat day . spekainh of the bible , cna you believe it's considered the best selling and most infpuential books of all time and over 5 billion copies have been sold ?"
8543,390,agent_1,i believe if ! i read it a few times a week ! it was nkice chagting with you today !
8544,391,agent_1,"hello , do you like avocado ice cream ? evidsently , it's lne of the weid things tom bradh likes ."
8545,391,agent_2,"er l . ,. dunno , never really tried it . i'd b ewilling to give it a spoonful even though it doeen't sound too appealing . lol . teah , tom brady's an interesting character . i was reading somewhere he consider football to be hisr eligio n. i knew some guy in texas that were like that q"
8546,391,agent_1,"weird . maybe he should grt a copy of htomas jefferson's bib,e , and give it a read ."
8547,391,agent_2,"maybe , although i dunno i fthere'sd anything aout football in tj's bibl4e . . hehe . ' thou shall not fumble ! '"
8548,391,agent_1,surely someone checked those trackers in his footballs for the properr infloation . .
8549,391,agent_2,"yeah , i heard aboutt hat . . they also keep track of where htey're going and how fast and stufff . i guess they need all that to compile accurate play stats . plus thy put them in players' shoudler pads to track their movements as well ."
8550,391,agent_1,do they have them on the cheerleade4rs s well ? so they know which restaurant theya re in ?
8551,391,agent_2,"that i couldn't tell ya . i'd hope not , as tht would be a bit creepy , imho ?."
8552,391,agent_1,"how lesea re they going to know that a cheerleader is at a restaurant , one of the players are at ?"
8553,391,agent_2,no idea . hey dif you know the visitors locker room at u of iowa is painted pink ? i think that's their way of trying to 'psych eout ' the other team . . .
8554,391,agent_1,"that amy have worked decades ago .t hese days , i don't think the players care . they probably find i tsoothing . maybe cumberland would have benefited from a soothing , pink locker room when they lost 2220 ."
8555,391,agent_2,"dunno . . . they did an experiment where they fpund that weight lifters vouldn't life as much when placed in a pink room . but , that wasw like twenty years ago , so maybe the effect has worn off on people's mjibds . wow , that's quit ea loss ! makes you wodner if they were even trying !"
8556,391,agent_1,"with scores like that , i can see hwy bowelrs in the 60's made more than football players ."
8557,391,agent_2,"do you think a woman could be a football player ? there's actually no rules in the nfl against it , so long as they meet the physical requiremehts . . ."
8558,391,agent_1,"why not ? many highschools have female kickers . a slong as the eligibility requirements afe met , they should have a chande ."
8559,391,agent_2,"dunno , if my daughter were playing football , id' constantly worry bout her getyting tackled ! but yeah , i see what you're saying there ."
8560,391,agent_1,"there are coed teams in my county . the girls are way tougher on the field than the boys are . iw ouldn't want mine to be a cheerleader , especially not for the saimts ."
8561,391,agent_2,"oh , really ? which countty i sthat , if you dont mind me asking ?"
8562,391,agent_1,county . k live in the us .
8563,391,agent_2,"county ! sorry , misreadt hat ! lol . here's something interesting , for as long as they gwmes last , there's onky actually about 1 1minutes of acgual gameplay .t hat mwns h6ey spend a lot of t8im ejust getting into position and stuff . . . weird , hu h?"
8564,391,agent_1,not asw eird as espn winning an emmy for superimposing a yellow line .
8565,391,agent_2,"oh , yeah , think i read about tuats omewhere . i rememberb ack when all they had were the white ' chalk ' lines and joe montana doing commentary . . . '; and then he runs to here , passes the ball , here ! ' hehe"
8566,391,agent_1,that eoundw bizarre . is thwt where the term ' gridiron ' fkootball comes fromj ?
8567,391,agent_2,"that i ould not tell you . i'd have to google it ! although it does make it sojnd tough , doesn't it ? the gridiron ! !"
8568,391,agent_1,"i honhestly coudl cxare elss , as i would take a nengineer over a baller anyday . they make more money , l9l"

8578,392,agent_2,"more than a dozen , i'm sure . i thought most of them went abnkupt during the great recession . huh . i guess i was wrong . how many are there ?"
8579,392,agent_1,well currently there are 32 teams .
8580,392,agent_2,32 seems a bit excessive . are they planning on leiminating a couple ? seems only fair . people ought to be diing things on a sunday .
8581,392,agent_1,"well , we can atch if we wat and if not we go do other things i guess . do you know what tyhe highest score is in football ?"
8582,392,agent_2,"the highest possible sacore in footblal would be infinjity , i guss . how high does the scoreboard go ? maybe that?s thel imit ."
8583,392,agent_1,"3well , the highest one recorded was 2202 when georgia tech beat the cumebrland"
8584,392,agent_2,teh scoreboard must have gone up to 999 ftehn .; that's a great score ! georgia teck must have been proud of themselves . did the other school just quit football out lf despair ? they should have .
8585,392,agent_1,"no i do not think they did , amybe it was not thei rday that day . do you eber watch espn ?"
8586,392,agent_2,"is that the spanish footabll channel ? no , i don't ."

8626,394,agent_2,i'm not swure . who was it .
8627,394,agent_1,it was georgia tec hwho scored 222 against cumberland 0
8628,394,agent_2,holys mokes ! i bet that was a long game for cubmer.and . un the 1960's bowlders made twice as much as the top football stars .
8629,394,agent_1,"how times have change d. b8t even now , engineers still make more over their lifetime"
8630,394,agent_2,probably because they have longer careers . did you kno wthere are 32 teams int he nfl ?
8631,394,agent_1,"yeah i think that would explain it . yup all 32 of them and they p,ay for 17 weeks ."
8632,394,agent_2,rhere is an average of only 11 minutes of actjal gameplay during a game . crazy .
8633,394,agent_1,"that is crazy , so short . did you know women can play too ?"
8634,394,agent_2,"i think there's now ri8tten rule that is against hav8ng female players . di you know that they use traking chips insid of the footballs to collect data like velocity , rotation , etc . on the, ?"
8635,394,agent_1,yeah and i hope they can use those data somehow to make the game safer adn reduc eyhe number of concussions
8636,394,agent_2,yes . i agree . did you know the bible is thw highest selling book of all time with over 5 billion cpies sold ?
8637,394,agent_1,"wow taht is a lot of books but i cannot say that i am surprised , a lot of people believe in it ."
8638,395,agent_1,do you think sports can brinfg people of different opinions and religion togetehr ?
8639,395,agent_2,i think it can be as ource of a common groun
8640,395,agent_1,it interestung that some people see s;orts as religion . witn allt h esimilqrities of rules and rituasl etc
8641,395,agent_2,i can see that people would have tob e as dedicate dto their sport as a religion to be succesaful
8642,395,agent_1,i think there are some patriot fans that are no9re serious about tom brady than they are their catholicism foot ball is no jooke ! espn has even managed to win na emmy for their superimposed lines that changedf football .
8643,395,agent_2,i like the patriots hey are lik ehe lsnnisters ogf football
8644,395,agent_1,that is a funny comparison . the nfl sure has enough strict rules to be the lannisters . especially with their chser leaderd . . . the sainrs cheerleaders arent even lalowed to eat in the same restaurant as the players
8645,395,agent_2,it seems like of backwards to still do it tofay
8646,395,agent_1,yezh it is . but i guess thats how it goes . theya lso chip the players on the field to track time . thats wild .
8647,395,agent_2,they also chip the football itself
8648,395,agent_1,i never even considered thay . technology sure has gcanged sports . i wonfer if other countries are into their sports like that too .
8649,395,agent_2,9 know that they are using cameras that can slow dosn imkages to get a more accurate judgement on sports
8650,395,agent_1,for the 11 minutes of actual game play in a foot ball game . . . hilarious
8651,395,agent_2,ell you have to admit tehre sure is a lot of adtion packed into those dozen or so minutes
8652,395,agent_1,yeah absolutely are you interested in presidengs ? teddy rolsevelt was pretty gnarly .
8653,395,agent_2,hows o ?
8654,395,agent_1,wel;l he survive dan assassination attempt and was one of the only prezzys not to ude a bible at the swear in ceremony . the ultimate se0aration of church and state . john quincy adams didnf either .
8655,395,agent_2,i can se what you mean
8656,395,agent_1,"do you particularly like any presidents ? i like abe lincoln a lot and controversially so , lbj ."
8657,395,agent_2,"i like washington , jfk , and roosevelt"
8658,395,agent_1,idk abkut roosevelt byut i know washington and jfk are considered among the wealthiest presidents .
8659,395,agent_2,i like washibton since he was te only person in hist0ry to unite botg parities
8660,395,agent_1,it wasnt a two prty system them .
8661,395,agent_2,"exacfly , now the two party system seems to argue over riticl issues just for thes ake of arguing"

8694,397,agent_2,"ig uess thar would be coiol . a tema full of womesn . pink and purple , roses and lace ."
8695,397,agent_1,might he interesting . bowlers apparently madw more than footbwll players in the 60s
8696,397,agent_2,"that was the culture then . people loved bwling . oh , i was born at thue wrong time ."
8697,397,agent_1,yeah its eems it was the case back then . do you know what the highest score in college football is ?
8698,397,agent_2,the highest score means little to me unless i could win money . what was i though ?
8699,397,agent_1,"it was 2220 , that is why it went down in history"
8700,397,agent_2,i feel sorry for the team tat won . they looked like teh worst bullues .
8701,397,agent_1,mwybe cumberland was just having ab ad day . did you know espn wona n emmy once ?
8702,397,agent_2,"cumberloand probably was having a bad year .e spn won an award for that line , right ? i think that was a bit silly ."
8703,397,agent_1,yea hbut it sure made out lives easierw ith that line . did ouh eary hey are using tracking chips on teh players now in the fidld ?
8704,397,agent_2,the plqyers need to be watched carefully . i figure it could help prevent injury .
8705,397,agent_1,yeah i hope thatt hey can use the stats for that . did you hear about that tidiculouhs rule for the new oroleans cheerpeaders ?
8706,397,agent_2,"the cheerleaders get treated so badly . it's really not riht . well , i enjoyed the chat ! have a tood day !"
8707,397,agent_1,yes i hope they get rid of that rule soon . have a good one .
8708,398,agent_1,good afternoon ! are you a fan of tom brady ? it's amzing he is still going strong evne into his 40s !
8709,398,agent_2,i think he?'s undeniably a great qb but i have a lot of probelms with him .
8710,398,agent_1,there are certainly some things i question . what ae your main issues ? do you have any concerns with his tb12 method ?
8711,398,agent_2,mainly the cheating . especially ehen i feel like he never had to do that . os the tb12 method the gook h wrote ?
8712,398,agent_1,"yes . i guess it is sort of considered ab ible for athletes . i guess to each their own , but there are some less than mainstream beliefs he has ."
8713,398,agent_2,i have not rea it but that's the vibe i was getting about it also . like a s3lfhelp type book .
8714,398,agent_1,i thjnk some people think he pushes the spiritula a little too much . a noted bosgon reporter name bob rya nthinks the book is ' creepy ' and equated it to being ' culflike . '
8715,398,agent_2,oh wow . yeah that would not be for me . are you a vootball fan ?
8716,398,agent_1,i really am a big fa nand it's one of my avirite sports . you ?
8717,398,agent_2,i a af an . did you know that esp nwon an emmy ftor inventinjg the yellow line tah tmars the first down ? can you uimagine wa5ching a game without that ?
8718,398,agent_1,no5 sure i could pictjre a game without it . there are times i forget that it's superimposed on the screen and wonder why tge player doesn't sde it when they don't make a first down .
8719,398,agent_2,"ha ha , me too . do you remember the patriots rb benjarvus greenellis ?"
8720,398,agent_1,vaguely . the patriots do some amaxing thing wuith rbs that haven't done anything huge in the league . what is special about him ?
8721,398,agent_2,he never fumbled a football gis enbtire career !
8722,398,agent_1,"whoa ! that is pretty special . i'm surprised he didn't hav e abigger career ? speaking of careers , cou.ld you imagine a time when a pr owler would make more than a foothall star ?"
8723,398,agent_2,i cannot imagien that at all . i didn't know there was everf a time when that happene d. i remember it being on tv radnomly when i was little but nt for a long time .
8724,398,agent_1,the 1960s wsere obviously a different tme . within a decade .f ootball was probably supplanting baseball and left the pro bowlers in the dust .
8725,398,agent_2,good point . any idea what the highest score in football ever we ?
8726,398,agent_1,"i seem to r3call it happened way bac kin like the second decade of the 1900s anr involved georgia tech , but can't place tge scre or opposition . ."
8727,398,agent_2,it was against cumberlans . the score was 2220 . ho wis that even possible ? !
8728,398,agent_1,"wow ! i think the most i have uheard about were scores in the 80s or maybe even 90 s, buft that wouldn't even reach half of that score ."
8729,398,agent_2,no . it seesm like they would have had to have been scoring the entire time .
8730,399,agent_1,"hello ! do you like football or tom brady ? i love football , but not a fan of brady or his tb12 nethod book ."
8731,399,agent_2,i do enjoyf ootball . i haven't looked too much into the tb12 method aka the athlte's bilbe he uses to swtay in top shape at 40 years old though .
8732,399,agent_1,"if eel like because he does so well at his plder age for football that h wis kidn of conceited , so much so that thsd ocumentary about him relates him to the messiah ."
8733,399,agent_2,"i completely agree with you there . i appreciate the more humble athletexs like benjarvus greenellis whos' never fumjbled the football in his entire pro career , ya know '?"
8734,399,agent_1,i completely agrere . i think espn was humble too when they won an emmy for their yellowl ineb ecause i hadn't heard about that until recentpy .
8735,399,agent_2,agreed . it was so innovative almost a sinn0vative as the chips they plant n ghe shoulder pads to record the players' every move . it's like what will they 6hink of next ? ha !
8736,399,agent_1,i know ! i wonder if they will ever use t5he hips they have in footballs to decde if a touchdown is valid instead of using replay .
8737,399,agent_2,"that is a good point . i mean , they can alrezdy track location , velocity ,s peed adn rotation , wso why not touchdowns as well ?"
8738,399,agent_1,maybe they can even see how long games are since they think only about 11 minutes are live gamdplay !
8739,399,agent_2,"no kidding , right ? i mean , these engineers already amke more than the average life6ijme earnigns o fboth mlb adn nfl players , so they should step their gam up . . . even though they are doing a phenomenal job now ."
8740,399,agent_1,that stat actually surprises me with how much footbal lplayerrs work q did you know that in the 60s even top bowlers made more than footabll players ? !
8741,399,agent_2,"i wasn't aware of that , actually . tht's sad and unfair almost as ba as the saints cheeleaders no5t being allowed to dine in the same restaurant as the football player s."
8742,399,agent_1,"that's terdible , especially since the cheerleaeers need to leave even if they were there first . talk about no womens right s?"
8743,399,agent_2,i know . i'm so surpfised mo lawsuits have been filed yet over that nonsense . i'm also surpeised we haven't had a female player drafted ye tconsidering there' no rules forbidding females from playing as long as they meet thge eligibility requirfements !
8744,399,agent_1,me too ! i wonder if thne university of iowa has ever gotten in trouble for having tjheir cisiting locker room painted pink . wonder if that tactic works ?
8745,399,agent_2,ha ! maybe umberland should have been placed in a pink lockerroo when georgia tech set the highest score record on them by beating them 2220 . sounds like they needed some sort of motivation !
8746,399,agent_1,i'm su4pr8sed tgeorhia tech didnt' just stop trying ! how do you feel ahout players pra6ing after the game ? did you know jefferson mad3e his own version of the bible ?
8747,399,agent_2,"i did , actually . in fact , i heard eh cut ou all the supernatural parts of it with a razor . do you thin kthey called it the ' king jefferson ' version ? ha !"
8748,399,agent_1,crazy ! and roosevelt and adams are the only two presidnetsw ho didn't us one at their swearing in !
8749,399,agent_2,"that i sinteresting . i also found it inteesting that up until the early 1960s , it was a com,on requirement for kids to read the bibel in school for their elementary education . that really sudprised me !"
8750,399,agent_1,very interesting ! nice chatting with gou !
8751,400,agent_1,"hi there , do you watcht he nfl games ?"
8752,400,agent_2,the nfl ? thej ational football league ? i've hearx of it . is thsat still around ?
8753,400,agent_1,yeah of course it is a bigd ela nowadays . much bigger tahn in th e60 when bowling was a bigger sport
8754,400,agent_2,bowling was a big spor tbecaus epeople did it so much . on the wekend sthey wold bowl fors ocial purposes . many people found spouses and lost children that way .
8755,400,agent_1,i guess so . rid you know the u of iiwa locekr room for visitors is painted pink ?
8756,400,agent_2,is that meant to do something to the players' psycholohy or something ? i don'tt hink that would work . it might mkae them donate to breast cacner research .
8757,400,agent_1,i know sk no txure what they are trying to achieve wit hthat . do you know what the highest score in football history is ?
8758,400,agent_2,the highest score is probably highr than most plkayers' iq . waa that when the patriots played the browns ?
8759,400,agent_1,"actually it was georgia teh agwinst cumberland , they beat htem 2220"
8760,400,agent_2,hm . i figured that tom brady gave a hbiblical whuooping to hte brownbs . oh well . 2220 ? die cumberland play wit htheir cheerleaders or what ?
8761,400,agent_1,"hahah good point , i have no idea but what a defeat . do you ever watch the espn ?"
8762,400,agent_2,is that like the nlf ? is it foothall ? or spanish soccer or somethinb ?
8763,400,agent_1,it is a channel that shows sports only and they once won an emmy because they ivnetned the superimposed ylelow line in football .
8764,400,agent_2,who is emmy ? adn tehy won her because of a yellow liner ? that seems like an odd connection .
8765,400,agent_1,emmy is an aeard and yeah kind of strange but t seeks it helps a lot when you afe watching the game at home
8766,400,agent_2,"i never needed an award t help me watch a game , but i guss tv and sports have changed ."
8767,400,agent_1,yeah for sure they have . do you know who ebnjarvus gr4enellis i s?
8768,400,agent_2,can't say that i've had the pleasure of his acquaintance .
8769,400,agent_1,"me either but he is a great player , a former qb who neved fumbled the ball in his career"
8770,400,agent_2,a qb that never rubmled ? that's incredible ! i can't barely hold a beer without spilling some on mt dog .
8771,400,agent_1,haha there you go . nice chatting with you .
8772,401,agent_1,"what do you think about tom brady , the football player ?"
8773,401,agent_2,i was never much a fan nut after i saw his tom vs time documentarty it totally changed my mind . i give im all the credit he deserves now and yes . . . i'm a gan now lol
8774,401,agent_1,"me too i really like him , thd pats would not have won the wuper bowl when they were trailing 328 withoujt him . what this tom vs time documentary about ?"
8775,401,agent_2,it's a behind the scenes look at how he prepares himself both physically wnd menta;ly for the nfl season . he pretty much never takes a day pff all year long .
8776,401,agent_1,is it related to his tb12 method ? some find it a little creepy .
8777,401,agent_2,in sme respects it is a little bit . you see somr of the ehalth and lifestyle decisiosj he makes in the documentary . he credits the tb12 method book for helping him to stay on top of his game .
8778,401,agent_1,"don't you think he gsould stick to being a football player , and keep hisa dvice to football and physical shape ?"
8779,401,agent_2,that's a to8gh call because th3 bok does focus on a heathy diet adn lifestyl eapproach that would crossover to help in football .
8780,401,agent_1,"maybe your are right , you cann9t really imprpve just one aspect of your ;life , your have improve jost of them at the same tiem . it is nearly impossible just to improve your alimentation , if you have a toxic lifestyle ."
8781,401,agent_2,true . did you know that the highest score ever in a footblal game is when georgia tech beat cumberland 2220 ? that seems crazy fthat it wass o high .
8782,401,agent_1,yeah how would you fele if you were in the losing team ? i think i would just lauh it out .
8783,401,agent_2,i would throw my hands up and just think ' well i am here for the education after all ' . lol
8784,401,agent_1,"i don't think there is anythign tol earn from that loss , i just hope nobody got injured durihng it ."
8785,401,agent_2,yes i aqgree . former patriots rb benjarvys greenellis has never fumbled the football once during hi snfl career . that's pretty impressive !
8786,401,agent_1,"as long ass he has played often , because i also never fubmled he football during my nfl career . what do you they do with all5 he data they gather from the sensors and chips they put in their equipmetn ?"
8787,401,agent_2,i don't onow . seems a little like they are getting too analytical to m e.
8788,401,agent_1,"maybe it i sfor television , like the yellow bar for the fidst deown . i can't imagine watching foitball without it ."
8789,401,agent_2,didn'?t epn win a nemmy for that ?
8790,401,agent_1,"yeah , i tbhink 9t was the kind of product that people needed but they did bnot know they needed it until it was shown to them ."
8791,401,agent_2,true . in the 1960's top bowlers made 2 times asm uch money as the top football stars from that era . that numver is probably different how .
8792,401,agent_1,"yeah , bit still , the average lifeti,e salary 9f an egnineer is higher that 6he ojne of a pro footballer , they earn a lot but just for a few years , i think it says a lot about bow low the pro bowle rslaary is ."
8793,401,agent_2,yes . the engineers have a longer career which makes sense . it wasn ice chat5ing with you this morning ! hope you have a gopd day !
8794,401,agent_1,"engineer don't hav emuch physical injurie s, that helps for having a long career . 6hanks for the conversxation ."
8795,402,agent_1,are you a tom brady fan ?
8796,402,agent_2,"yes , i am . in fact l i heard that tom brady treats football as a religion !"
8797,402,agent_1,"well hisr eligion , apparently he wrote a book about it called tb12 metho0d . hav eyou read it ."
8798,402,agent_2,an that book . wasn't a book that was branded as an 'athlete bible' ? i have heard much about the book .
8799,402,agent_1,"well wome aay that itw as kind of cultist . so i n9ot sure i care to read it really . i'll just stick to watching him ,ake great plays ."
8800,402,agent_2,"we cannot talk about tom brady without yalkingt abou6t the footblal sport ss a whole . did you know that 8 nthe 1960s , top bowlersm ade twice as much as p5ofessional football players ? imagine a bowler making t3icd the amount of tom brady !"
8801,402,agent_1,yeah that?'s weird however did you know his wife makes twice as much as him bnow ?
8802,402,agent_2,no i did not . wow ! an engineer would make more thab tom brady if you compared their lifetime earnings . that i sprobably due to how few years football can be played professionally .
8803,402,agent_1,wow that is something but i'd 5ather dp1 015 and ou5 with millionst hat 4050 .
8804,402,agent_2,agreed . i just watned to point out that womenw ould b3e allowed to play in the nfl if they meet the leatue requirem3nts .
8805,402,agent_1,i would love to see a women's league in football like the wnba .
8806,402,agent_2,the visitors locker room in thje university of iowa is painted pink . talk about demoralizing !
8807,402,agent_1,yeah i'm sure you riht ! do you know what the higbest scoring football game was .
8808,402,agent_2,"no id o n0t , which one was it ?"
8809,402,agent_1,cumberland and georgi tech back in 1916 the score was 2200 .
8810,402,agent_2,do you know which football player never fumbled the bal once ?
8811,402,agent_1,"wow that's quite an achievement , i think he played for the patriots right ?"
8812,402,agent_2,"yep , it was greenellis who didf iy . amazing right ?"
8813,402,agent_1,"yeah , ehy did hou know that the nlf only produced one left handed quarterback ?"
8814,402,agent_2,"ah , shaquem giffin right ?"
8815,402,agent_1,if orget his name . well it was nice talking with you ! if you get a chance you should check out the alocrypha .
8816,403,agent_1,"hi , are you a footbzll fan ?"
8817,403,agent_2,nfl ? yes . did you know that an average nfl game ponly has1 1 minutes of live gaemplay ? seesm small .
8818,403,agent_1,i didn't know that 3xact figures but i kne it wasn't much . and yet we all watch . go figure .
8819,403,agent_2,we are staved for violence . we like glad8iators and combat ? could women e in there though ? the nfl has no rule against female playees .
8820,403,agent_1,"i think if htey're good enough they should be allowed . but , i wonder if they can get that strong . you ?"
8821,403,agent_2,probably can't .
8822,403,agent_1,had you heard that tom brady eats avocado ice cream ? i dind't even know there was such a thing .
8823,403,agent_2,"with all his cash , he can proabbly get any kind of , disgusting , ice cream he wants ."
8824,403,agent_1,yeah probably . have you heqard about his book ?
8825,403,agent_2,his book on avocado ice cream ? is that a thing ?
8826,403,agent_1,not he book is more about how h ekeeps h4althy ag 40 and his philosophy about life and football .
8827,403,agent_2,he probably has a bunch of followers wahi buy the boo . is it popular ?
8828,403,agent_1,"well , they say it's a best seller . you sound like you're not a tom brandy fan ."
8829,403,agent_2,i don't really know much about him . i know thzat he has won many super bowls . he married a model . that's it .
8830,403,agent_1,"i think he is kind of full of himself , and while i'm not really a fan i can't help rooting for him because of his age . at my age i lik4 to see old guys do well ."
8831,403,agent_2,we all. hope to retain the vigor of youth durin our s7net years . yet few of us have access to avocado ice cram .
8832,403,agent_1,"no , but it dsounds kind f goos . i like avocado and i like ice cram . i've heard of worse combinations ."
8833,403,agent_2,i guess i should try it before i judge i t. maybe tom is onto9 a winning combination .
8834,403,agent_1,"wel; , he must be doing something right . hard to argue with that mucy succesas ."
8835,403,agent_2,"true . i giess he has many years of playing sucvess still elf inj him . anyway , great chatting qwith you ! habe a god 3vening !"
8836,403,agent_1,thanks . same to you .
8837,404,agent_1,"hi , did you hear about the new egland patruots and tom brwd ?"
8838,404,agent_2,"yes , i have heard about them but i don't think i've heatrd any updates about them since the superbowl and recently the news about the patriot's owner , robert kraft . hqave you ?"
8839,404,agent_1,"yes , i've heard quite a bit about them . according tgo goptham chopra , brady's o na spiritual quest asw ell as hiz opinion that football has become brady's religion ."
8840,404,agent_2,"oh , i thin ki hear dabout the ' toj vs . time ' documentary tuougbh i've never seen it , have you ?"
8841,404,agent_1,"no , i've havent' seen it but i will look for it , it sounds like an inspirational show . i'm interested to find out ho wspiritual things are connected to football . that seems strange to me ."
8842,404,agent_2,"i forgot where it is beign broadcasted , do you now ? is it on v or netflix or something ? yeah me too , maybe there's some sort of thingh e does that's revealed in the series that allows him to be such a great plwyer !"
8843,404,agent_1,it airs on facebook watcu which yku have to have a subscription to . it apparently looks at brady's mental and physical preparation and his spiriaul sid ea swell .
8844,404,agent_2,"oh well i don't have a subscription for that , do ou ? i wonder why they chose that platform to air iy on . yeah , my friend who has seen it told me it completely chaned his opinion about the guy6 , eh went from not liking him to actually thinking and respecting the guy ."
8845,404,agent_1,"well , i don't have a ubscriptionb ut i figure sooner or later netflix will gewt it and i'll watch it then . with as much success as tom brady and the patriots have gotten , you'd think he knows something that no one else is thinking abou t."
8846,404,agent_2,"oh that's true , i hope it does come on netflix , it might even win an award , like hwen espn won an emmy for using the yellow line in the games ."
8847,404,agent_1,"yes , tha tcould happen but think about what real succedss tom and the patriots are garnishing . the have a whole state ont heir side . even churches in new england talk abou the team on sundays at the palpit . that's not something that's going on everywhere in the us ."
8848,404,agent_2,"yeah , for people who aren't pattiots fans living in that area , i think their houses mihgt be teepee'd or something or perhaps painted completely pink like what the uiversity of iowa di dto the visiting football teams' locker rooms ."
8849,404,agent_1,"yes , that could be , sometimes you don' twant to feel gthe wrath of the opposing team . but , gou have toa dmit that in lst years super bowl , the patriots pulled it out in o0vertime to win the gmae and that was very exciting , to say the elast ."
8850,404,agent_2,"the super bowl game last year was entertaining and quite good , the tb12 method does work , do you know what the 12 in tnhat temr stands for ?"
8851,404,agent_1,"no , what do yout hink it means ?"
8852,404,agent_2,perhaps you're only allowed to eat 12 items per day in the diet ?
8853,404,agent_1,"no , i think it has to do with entire lifestyles f spirituality , fitness , nutrition , philosophies and stuff like thar . did you know thart former patriots rb benjavus greenellis ha snever fumbeld the football in his nfl career ? thats amazing ."
8854,404,agent_2,"oh ok , or maybe it has something to do with bady's jersey number which is 1q , i think . that is impressive , perhaps the religion of the game or f tom brady ehlped him achieve that feat !"
8855,404,agent_1,"it could be that you are correct , i' mguedsin myself . i do know that it sounds inspirational and like something other teams might want to particiate in . that tb1q method , i mean ."
8856,404,agent_2,yeah ! do you think schools should require reading the bible as part of their educational curriculun ?
8857,404,agent_1,"it would not bge a bad id3ea in my opinion . teaching morals and ethics is a good thing . it's been great chatting with you , hace a good one ."
8858,405,agent_1,"hello t5here , do youw atch the nfl ?"
8859,405,agent_2,"yes , i do , go to the games !"
8860,405,agent_1,nice . do you have a favorite player or team ?
8861,405,agent_2,"i like the tampa bay buccaneers , patriots ! ! how about you ?"
8862,405,agent_1,"nice same here , i love the patriots and brady . did 7ou know he is an author of a book now too ?"
8863,405,agent_2,"yes , i have not read it yet ! but i want to . havbe you read it ?"
8864,405,agent_1,"i have not , but the guy seems to b eeverywhere now . did you know women ca nplay in the nlf too ?"
8865,405,agent_2,"yes , that's fair , as long as they can deal with it . do you know what the tb12 method is ?"
8866,405,agent_1,isn't that brady's lifestyle brand ?
8867,405,agent_2,"y7es it is , how do you like the flavor od avocado ice cream ? i love avocado , but have never had it in ice cream !"
8868,405,agent_1,i love it actually and i gear that brady keeps healthy by sticking to that kind of ice cream
8869,405,agent_2,"okay , i will have to find somew and try it . have you seen the fi,lm , tom vs tom ?"
8870,405,agent_1,i have not seen it i headrd that it is about brad and him getting ready for the nfl season have you seen it ?
8871,405,agent_2,not yet ! matthew slater and tom are good friends on the team .
8872,405,agent_1,nice . i will be hecking that documentary series 0ut . heard they are plqcing tracking chipz on the plzyers now
8873,405,agent_2,"yes , shoulder pads and footballs ! i think its a great idea ! thinking its better in the long run fo egnineers than the averwge nfl player ."
8874,405,agent_1,yeah nas they already make more than foobtall players in their lifetime
8875,405,agent_2,"yes , have you seen pictures of the real building in modern day iraq , the etemenanki ?"
8876,405,agent_1,i have no tbut i hear that people believe that that is the tower ofb absl . i would like to visit that for sure
8877,405,agent_2,"yes , i want to look t5hat up . i am not sure i would want to gisit iraw rihgt now . great chat ! !"
8878,405,agent_1,yeah maybe in the future when things cqlm down . same here .
8879,406,agent_1,"hi there , do you watch hte nfl ?"
8880,406,agent_2,yes i do . i am a fan of the game . what about ylu ?
8881,406,agent_1,nice me too . did you knw women can play as wel l?
8882,406,agent_2,no i actually did not know hat was a fact . i was curious if any woamn has ever tried out for a team .
8883,406,agent_1,i wonder too and if they have tried they muet not have made it yet . do you know what the highest score in college football is ?
8884,406,agent_2,"yes , 2220 ! thats amazing . i wonder how bad your team must be to lose so handidly . casn yo believe that t5om brady really wants to keep playin g?"
8885,406,agent_1,"eah most players his age are pretty much done at this point and hence i guess they amke leszs money than engineers , their careers are shorter"
8886,406,agent_2,"that was onteresting as well . i think tehr eis one kicker who is like 47 who said he will keep playing . but with that , i guess you onlyu have a few playd a game where you actually do anythign ."
8887,406,agent_1,yeah exactly . did you know espn won a nemmy for the superimposed yellow line ?
8888,406,agent_2,i had seen that before somewhere . technology has cbanged the game . i did not know that it was only 11 minutes of actua tiem .
8889,406,agent_1,"yea hit sure has . and yet when you htink about it , we ar5e g.ued to the tv for hours"
8890,406,agent_2,"we are . the super bowl is liek 4 hours when you add in alkl teh comcerials . it wasnt a very entwrtaining game either , but i was happy brady 2on again ."
8891,406,agent_1,"yeha a lot of people were happy abourt that , includ8ng me . on another topic , do you know much about teh bible ?"
8892,406,agent_2,i was raised in the faith but hventr eally read much of it . i didnt know mos tchildren read it up until the 9160s
8893,406,agent_1,i se e. yes i am surprised ytat it was part of the education system for that long did you kno wjeferson created his own version of the bible ?
8894,406,agent_2,"yes i did see that , it was fascinating to learn that . i also was interested in the translation of apple being the same as evil"
8895,406,agent_1,yeah that is pretty cool . roosevelt and quincy also opted out of using the bible to swear in
8896,406,agent_2,suprise dthat its only been two o fthme . i wonder thei5 reason
8897,406,agent_1,i bet you they were not religious an dopted out of it . do you know much about the tower of babel ?
8898,406,agent_2,i don . i was jnterested to look that up . ive head how it kind of defines why people speak different language
8899,406,agent_1,"apparently people believe that 9t s in the modern day iraq , the etemenanki ."
8900,407,agent_1,i enjoy footnall . are you a fan ?
8901,407,agent_2,"y3s i am a faj of fotball ,t he american version , are you a fan of that one or soccer but others like to call football in other cluntries ?"
8902,407,agent_1,american foptall . were you aare that in the 06'z top bowlers made more thn top football players ? i cna't imagine that now .
8903,407,agent_2,"yeah , i don't even think bowling is broadcaste don spodts stations or on any stationms at all , if it was , would you watch it ?"
8904,407,agent_1,no . i feel liek theyw ere randoly on tv when i was littlpe but not for a very long time . do you have any guess as ti what the highest score in football ever was ?
8905,407,agent_2,somewhere in the 70s ? it's harx to imagne a game beiun gsuch a hkg score whent here's only eleven minutes of liveg ameplay !
8906,407,agent_1,wow ! thats' an insanely sjall amount of gameplay . georyia tech deefeated cumberland in 1916 with as core of 222q0 !
8907,407,agent_2,wow ! that's insane ! that would hurt my pride a lot but at whqt point in the game do you just call it quits ?
8908,407,agent_1,good question . i didn't know it was even possile to score that many points . it woul just have to be constant scores .
8909,407,agent_2,"yeah exactly , did you know that the saints cheerleaders are forbidden from dining in ths present of nfl players , such horrible treatemnt !"
8910,407,agent_1,"that's upsetting . i did hea rabout that . what really disgusts me is that is the cheerleadrr was there firs6t and is already eating , se ahs to stop eating and leave . that makes em very angry . what's the point in that ?"
8911,407,agent_2,"yeqh , why is there even such a rule , qhat benefit does it serve ? i think , if anything , that rule just adds to the ego of football players ."
8912,407,agent_1,i agree . did you also know that there are tracking chips in players shoulder pads ane the football ?
8913,407,agent_2,is it to track their speed and movement or impact of tackles perhaps ?
8914,407,agent_1,"it tracks velocity , rotation , ball spee d, and location . why dot hey not use these as part of making the calls ? why do they rely only oj reviews when tehy have this technology ?"
8915,407,agent_2,"yeah thats' a great point ! i wonder if the agents use this data to negotiate better contracts and salaries for their palyers , itc ould eb a great bargaining tool ."
8916,407,agent_1,"i agree . since they are not doing any of this , it begs the qyestion what are they doing with this data ?"
8917,407,agent_2,"probably s3lling it to people in this digktal age and yet the average lifetime earnings of an engineer is higher than that of the nfl player , any theoriesw hy that's the case ?"
8918,407,agent_1,i have no idea . that's the first iv'e heard of it . i'm surprised more people do9n't go for that theh rather than hoping for a f9otball career . it woild certainly be less hard on your body .
8919,407,agent_2,"i agree , so that could possib;y mean females are quite smart since even though they're qllowed to plzy in the nfl , they don't becaus ei'ts such a ohysical and injury inducing sport !"
8920,407,agent_1,"ha ha , that's true !"
8921,408,agent_1,"hello , do you wafch football ?"
8922,408,agent_2,"hi , yes . i love football ! i did no6 realizs thr season lasted 17 weeks !"
8923,408,agent_1,yeah pretty long . i guess with3 2 teams laying it takes that much tume
8924,408,agent_2,did you se4e they only rest on weekend during the season ?
8925,408,agent_1,"that is crazy , so muchw ork goes in ther e. did you know iu of iowa painted hteir visitor locker room pink ?"
8926,408,agent_2,"oh yes , that is so funny . they really want to intimidate the other team , but is more like a joke"
8927,408,agent_1,"wow , what an idea . did you know bowlers used to make more than football players in the 60s ?"
8928,408,agent_2,"things have really chantged , football is so popular today . and today engineers make on average more tahn football players !"
8929,408,agent_1,yeah i guess the career of a footbal lplayer does ot last that long so they do not have much time to make mney
8930,408,agent_2,"true , i did not think about that , do you know ow we are able to learn about interesting statistics like bwll speed . all rotationa nd player sperformanc e?"
8931,408,agent_1,"yeah that is actually pretty cool , they are using tracking chips on the shoulder pads of the playeds now ."
8932,408,agent_2,i find that pretty interesting ! ! did you know when was rhe h9ighest sfore i na football match ever ?
8933,408,agent_1,yeah it was whn georgi atech beat cumerland 2220 . what a game
8934,408,agent_2,"that is crazy , that happened more than 100 years ago ! never something like that again ."
8935,408,agent_1,yup i do no hink so ither . did you know women can play too ?
8936,408,agent_2,if they meet the re2uirements . i would like to see that happwn . it would have to be a very strong woman though .
8937,408,agent_1,"yeah , but i would like to see that too . did you hea rabout that rule for the new orleans cheerleaders ?"
8938,408,agent_2,i could not believe when i learned they can't esat at the same restaurant where an nfl playere ate ! !
8939,408,agent_1,that is s sad rule and teh worst part is that the6y have to leave mid meal if a plahyer wwalks in
8940,408,agent_2,i do not think that rule can last lon g! did youk now that there are other types of football ?
8941,408,agent_1,"yeqh like soccer , canafdian football , australian , rugby , all the fun ones ."
8942,409,agent_1,hi ! are you a brady fan ?
8943,409,agent_2,"hi ! i love tom brady ! in fact , i've ben wanting to study the tb12 method aka hte athelte's bible that he says helps him stay in top shape at 40 years old . wht about you ?"
8944,409,agent_1,"i have heard of i , but have n9t read it . you ?"
8945,409,agent_2,i would like to ! i also want to see the to vs . time series that recently premiered on facebook watch as well that focuse on is physical or mental preparation as well as his spiritula side .
8946,409,agent_1,"sounds awrsome . i admire his dedicatoion tot he caft of football , but i am uncertain about his relig9ous overtones ."
8947,409,agent_2,agreed ! so are you a foobtall fan ? i certainly am although i wish it was longer . the 17 week regular seson rom september to december just isn't long enough for me . ha !
8948,409,agent_1,"yup , me too . an dthere is only 11 minutes of actual playtime per gae . leaves you wahting more !"
8949,409,agent_2,so true ! and can you believe there are actually no rules against women playing as pong a sthey meet the eligibility requirements ? i can't believe we haven't at least had a female kicker by now !
8950,409,agent_1,yeah . that would be a good position . i wonder what the minimum eligibility requirements ?
8951,409,agent_2,"that's a good question ! but perhaps if they're doing it sikply for the pay , hgey'db e better off entering the engineering field since engineers make more than the average lifeyime earnings of bot hmlb and nfl players , ya know ?"
8952,409,agent_1,sounds about right . but hard to believe that bowlers used to be paid better than nfl athletes !
8953,409,agent_2,"tha tis hard to believe , isn't it ? wonxder how much someone like benjarvus greenellis gets paid considering he's never fumbled the football in his entire pri career ! that is amazing !"
8954,409,agent_1,"yeah , ad i bet he never dropped his wallet either ! i would give him an emmy for that performance ! better than the espn emmy for for creating the superimposed 6ellow line !"
8955,409,agent_2,ha ! you are so right abou tthat ! and that yellow line was truly innovative . similar to the chips embedded into the shoulder pads thay records each players ebery move ! that is iuncredible if you ask m !
8956,409,agent_1,seems creeph to me . big brotherw atching your every step . . .
8957,409,agent_2,"yeah true . tehy also have a chip planted in the ball that tracks location , speed ,v elocity anc rotation as ewell !"
8958,409,agent_1,"that maeks more sense to me . not as creepy . like the new orleans saints , who restrict movements of chearleaders . have you heard of this ?"
8959,409,agent_2,"yes and that's so misogynisti c. can you believe it ? i'm so s8rprised no lawsits have bewe iped over that silly rule . it's worse than georgia tech once humiliating cumberland 2220 . even though that's teh hoghest score in football history , it's still classless . bu tnot as bad as what the saints do to 6heir cheerleadsrs ."
8960,409,agent_1,you wang humiliating ? try dressing in a pink loxkeroom like they have at univ of iowa !
8961,409,agent_2,"ha ! can you imagine what that does ? it could b ea good thing . . . or very bad ! ha ! i know we talkec about the athlete's bible earlier , but do you know anything about the regular bible as well ? i can't bliueve i thas sold over 5 billion copies . i guess that's why they call it the best selling and most influetial bkok of all time ."
8962,409,agent_1,awesome book . i even like thje apocrypha ! nice chatting !
8963,410,agent_1,"are uo a nfl fan ? if so , you may find it interesting that many are drawing religious parallels with the new england patrkots ."
8964,410,agent_2,"yes , new engalnd patriots ppager sare favore to win super bowl ii , whicb could be the zixth nfl championship ."
8965,410,agent_1,tey may do so with the help of brady's ' a5hletes bible '
8966,410,agent_2,"football has become bfady religion , said chopra . eh is the one of the best player , which credits with helping him stay at th etop of his game at age of 40 ."
8967,410,agent_1,yep . the pat's have quie a fan base tyat worships coach bill elichick . teh say : ' in bill we tdust . '
8968,410,agent_2,"other than football , brady turn ijto spiritual life for the purpose . it was the great loss to the football fan ."
8969,410,agent_1,he's not the only one on the tem . matthew salter is an evangelist of fthe field .
8970,410,agent_2,"yes , brady is a kind of messiah figure for a lot of patriots fasn ."
8971,410,agent_1,i think he's more into ehalth and nutrition thasn he is religion . he show's no sign of quitting football .
8972,410,agent_2,football are always take healthy food and regular exercise 6o make thwm fit for th egame . it very essential because they a4e playing for the nation . small injury make them very upet .
8973,410,agent_1,i bet the fans for cumberland were upset in 1916 . the yot beat by georgia tech 2220 .
8974,410,agent_2,"surely , its now also shocking . the university of iowa's locker room for visiting fkootball team is completel painted with pink ."
8975,410,agent_1,pink ? wow . it's funny to know that pro bowlers made more in the 1960's than the top football stars .
8976,410,agent_2,"oct 7 , 19i1t is the sad day for cumberland bulldog . they lose the match with ge3odgia tech ."
8977,410,agent_1,yes . the nfl has no ru;e against females playing the game .
8978,410,agent_2,cheerleader are npt allowd to eating in the same restaurant as any nfl player and if they alreadu dinhign in teh restaurant if any nfl player comes the cheerleader required to leave . it is the biggest ru8le in the nfl .
8979,410,agent_1,"yeah , i heard that about te n . o . saints .q lso amazing is that there are only q minutes of live game play ina nn fl game ."
8980,410,agent_2,nfl uses tracking chips in player shouler padst o record the movement of the player in the field .
8981,410,agent_1,so hightech . . . it's wild to know that the tower of babel was likely are rea lbuilding in ijraq .
8982,410,agent_2,bilbe iz considered hte product of divine inspirtiona nd record a relationship betwene god and human .
8983,410,agent_1,yes . thanks for the ch t!
8984,411,agent_1,did you hear that the patriots football team in the nfl wkn ht4 superbowl ?
8985,411,agent_2,"yeah , again . lol"
8986,411,agent_1,i wonder if it id because of prayer that they win ?
8987,411,agent_2,"well , hray does have that tb12 method ."
8988,411,agent_1,what's a b12 method ?
8989,411,agent_2,bradys method 12 is his number from the patriots . it invklves his avocado ice cream .
8990,411,agent_1,in ever heard of tuat avocado ice .
8991,411,agent_2,neither have i . i do think it would be interesting though .
8992,411,agent_1,i wonder if something weird is going on with the patrios . is it just skill ?
8993,411,agent_2,"i dont know , they sure are dominant . its like no one xcan stop ghem ."
8994,411,agent_1,maybe it d his tb12 method fhat makes him unstoppable .
8995,411,agent_2,"could be , he consider football like his religion ."
8996,411,agent_1,"yes , evsn the coach said he wasc onceened tat the faith in the game migght be more than their faith un church ."
8997,411,agent_2,people considr him a messiah . there is an in bill we trust motto
8998,411,agent_1,"yes , i don't even wathc football until recently ."
8999,411,agent_2,i dont watch much because of lack of cable .
9000,411,agent_1,i xon't have cable but i do have a roku which streams shows . itd id show the superbowl until the last 2 minutes .
9001,411,agent_2,"that was the imprtant pat , i night bneed to look into a roku ."
9002,411,agent_1,you should . you buy it once and then you get lots of things free . it was crazy htat they cut it at the last moment . i then watched it on my computer .
9003,411,agent_2,"i do like watching a lot of sports , so thuat might be a good option ."
9004,411,agent_1,"yes , you cqn also gby sports packags just for your tast e."
9005,411,agent_2,awesome ! great chat ! have a good night .
9006,412,agent_1,good morning ! do you like football ? fan of tom brady ?
9007,412,agent_2,"hi ! yes i am to both questions , i also really likeb ill belichick's coaching , i've read books and articles praising his leadership , you ?"
9008,412,agent_1,yes ! no xdoubt the best coach of al ltime i think . did you ever see the documentary tom vs time which was about brwdy ?
9009,412,agent_2,"oh , i haven't hearda bout that documentary , is it kn netflix or somjethin ?"
9010,412,agent_1,i watchef it on one of those at one time . totally changed the way i tiught about brady . i went from no6 liking him to being a really big fan . he puts a ot of work into his craft and t comes tnrough in the documnetary . i think the first couple o fepisodesw ere om facebook .
9011,412,agent_2,"oh wow , ok , ij'll have to look into that . maybe i5 was that documentary that i saw r something else that also chagned my perspective on th4 guy . have you eard baot his bt12 die t?"
9012,412,agent_1,i haven't heard about it . tell me more .
9013,412,agent_2,"it's a vesdy extrmeed iet called hte tb12 method whe4e he only eats certain natura lprodeue , good carbs , and all organic . it's what allows him to play well according to him , forgot wjatt he 12 stands f9r though , do you know ?"
9014,412,agent_1,interesting ! dkd you know the nfl has no written rupe against female players ?
9015,412,agent_2,"wow , has there 3ver ben a veamle player in tehn fl ? i don't think i recall seeing or hearing in the news that a female has ever played int he nfl , i imagine that'd garner a lot of attention in the media ."
9016,412,agent_1,"not yet . but , i'm sure there will be on esomeday . thre's only an avsrage of 11 minutes of actua llive gameplay in an nfl game . i wish they wouldc playm ore htan that ."
9017,412,agent_2,"with only eleven minutes of live gameplay and yet i devote an etbire afternoon and evening ! if the games were longer , i think i'd have to spendt he whole day in feont of the tv , which i don't think i mind being a couhc potato"
9018,412,agent_1,lol i wouldn't mind it . i like watching the games becauzse it gives me a chance to unwind before the work week . in te 1960's bowlers made more than twice as much a the top foktball stars of that era .
9019,412,agent_2,"same here . i wonder if that's still true today , it seems there's aj emphasis on salary of football players since the average lifetime sarnings of an engineer are also higher than fpotball players . i find that very hard to beliebe ."
9020,412,agent_1,i wonder if it's because engineers have longer careers ?
9021,412,agent_2,"oh , good point . but i imagine multimillione ndorsements are probably hiygher than the players' salary ."
9022,412,agent_1,"that's incredible how htey do that wi8th the chips . they also have them in the fotball sto trakc velocity , etc ."
9023,412,agent_2,"that's pretty nea t, do you know if thiz dat qhas been released ?"
9024,412,agent_1,i am not sure . i always think it's funny when you hear soccer being referred to as football in other4 parts of the world outside of hte u . s .
9025,412,agent_2,"yeah , it really throws me off a bit especiallyw hen football is such a big sport in the us . is soccer one of yo8r favorte sports ?"
9026,412,agent_1,somewhat . i'm a big baseball fan ! it was nice cha5ting with you today !
9027,413,agent_1,"hey , are you a tom brady or nfl fan ?"
9028,413,agent_2,"no , i zam a pittsburgh steelers fan , bu tthey lost shorlty after they made it to the playoff ."
9029,413,agent_1,"i ams orry to hear baout your two best players leaving . i like tom brady , i have his bibl !"
9030,413,agent_2,"oh realy , that's great , he believe his bible helped him to win games until the age of 40 ."
9031,413,agent_1,"i guess so , lol . i don't know if it can helo him anymore ! do you watch college football at all ?"
9032,413,agent_2,"i like college footabll getter than pro l i watched the big game alabama vs clemson , two of the toughest teams ."
9033,413,agent_1,"ysea that was a god game ! i am a iowa hawkeye fan , did you kno wtheir visiting lokcrr room is pink !"
9034,413,agent_2,"yes , i read about that , i think the hawkeyes are pretty good , but for som ereason i aways look for more fromt he players ."
9035,413,agent_1,"i agree , sometimes they disappoint . at least their games are longer in total playtime . nfl games only have 11 minutes"
9036,413,agent_2,"do you actually believe that ? just think about four quarters , quzarterback time , running back time , kicking time , not even counting commsercia.ls ."
9037,413,agent_1,i think so . i think the play clock runs so much of th etime off before a pla is ran .
9038,413,agent_2,just thunk about the time4 the players take in a gwames divided into four quarters . maybe this just my opinion .
9039,413,agent_1,"for sure , their bodies alone take the biggest beating of all . maybe why engineers created chipst o track in their shoulder pads ."
9040,413,agent_2,"yes you are right , i a mglad that the nfl imprlove protection for the players and to track them maybe for their safety ."
9041,413,agent_1,doi you watch espn at all ?
9042,413,agent_2,"yes k, espn is one ofm y favorite channel especially when i tcomes to college football . do you watch espn a lt ."
9043,413,agent_1,"i do , did you know they won an emmy for tjhat yellow line that shows the first down on tv ? so interesting !"
9044,413,agent_2,"no i dindt know that , i always wonder aboutt he lines on the field . i w9nder what they were using before espn came up with that ."
9045,413,agent_1,"for sure , i bet it was so c5azy ! good chatting with you friend !"
9046,413,agent_2,"it is crazy , nice chattjing with you also ."
9047,413,agent_1,bye !
9048,414,agent_1,hey ! do you like tom brady ?
9049,414,agent_2,i mifht . who is he and what doesh e do ?
9050,414,agent_1,"he is a quarterback kn the nfl , well knowh for winning superbowl games ."
9051,414,agent_2,he must be a tremendous talent . is h any good at singing nad dancing ?
9052,414,agent_1,i am not sure about that but he viewes foofball as a type o freligion to him .
9053,414,agent_2,he probsbly has to sing and dance in exultation during the services he leads . is he ordained in the nfl ?
9054,414,agent_1,i know he is religious . a lot of tue patriots team mdmbers are . i canj't answer that question . . . . . do you watch football at all ?
9055,414,agent_2,"i used to watch , but then i was told that it5 is sinful . i didn't understand that itw as sinful because i ain't studied on the biblw in a while ."
9056,414,agent_1,"oh , ok . i like football andt he nfl but don't have gime to really follow it .s o you ar religious ? ywa know the bible ha ssold ver 5 billion copies . a lot of people ead the bible ."
9057,414,agent_2,a lot of people do eat the bible . it has many pages that are comestible .
9058,414,agent_1,"my error , i wrote ead . . . . . read is what i meant . so you have read the bible in your life ?"
9059,414,agent_2,i keep one around just in case . sometimes i find that in emeegencies it can be valuable .
9060,414,agent_1,"that's goo d. the nfl team the patriots try to keep their religion as their focal point during games instead of jhst focusing on the game , pretty good 5hing to do ."
9061,414,agent_2,i didn't know that they culd do that . is that a kind of cheating ? would that give them an advsntabe ?
9062,414,agent_1,i have no idea . how would looking to god in your everydsy life eb cheating in a football game ?
9063,414,agent_2,they are appealing to a higher power that can shif tthe game i ntheir favor . do thse bookies know ? is it reflected in thew spread ?
9064,414,agent_1,"again , can't answer that . i dio have some fun facts on the bible though ! yay ! the biblical tower of babelk is based on a real building in ira q."
9065,414,agent_2,how interesting !
9066,414,agent_1,another fun bible fact . . . . thoma sjefferson created his own bible . . . . and cut ou th pa4rts he didn't like .
9067,414,agent_2,"i guess that makes sense . you don't like something , throw it away . i guess he must have disliked the parts about religion ."
9068,414,agent_1,i guess he did . aslo a patriots player rb benjarvus gredn a player ihn the nfl neverf ubmled a ball during his entire football career !
9069,414,agent_2,i guess that's a pretty good thing . did hes get special money for that ? i figure he should get somethin glike a promotion .
9070,414,agent_1,"i don't beieve so . but all i can say is football , the nfl are a great sport and even iv they read their bibles and focus on god during games it all semes great to me : , it as been an interesting chat , you have a great day ! ! bye !"
9071,415,agent_1,hi there ! are you a football fan ?
9072,415,agent_2,"good m,orning ! yes , i am . what about you ?"
9073,415,agent_1,"i watch mostly college , but i tend to watchm ost dyring playoff time ."
9074,415,agent_2,"that's cool , i like nfl football ."
9075,415,agent_1,did you catch the superbowl this year ' prett7 soon brady is going to run out of fingers to put those rings on !
9076,415,agent_2,"actually , i did . that thing was too long , though . i sat for 3 hours , makes me mad to think that the average nfl game has ony q1 minutes of actual live gameplay ."
9077,415,agent_1,"same here . there is so much waiting aro8und . id like to see ag ame qith a running clock for all of it , stopping only whenh teams score . thatw ould give more action ."
9078,415,agent_2,you know they have tracking chis in the player'?s shoulder pads thnat records every move on hte field . it would be interesting to see what that data hsow s!
9079,415,agent_1,"it would . id evenl ike to see how hard those guys are actually gett9ng hit . i know the nfl doesnt have rupes against female players , but i dont know if a femal ewould want to take some oft hat impact from those 300 pound lineman ."
9080,415,agent_2,"me either , but i think i'd like to see at least one female on the field .w ould make things more interesting , to me !"
9081,415,agent_1,same h4ere . i think there migh tbe a fekale on oen of the officiaying crews . i think i saw something about that a while hack .
9082,415,agent_2,"on a different note , do you read the bible ?"
9083,415,agent_1,"i havent ever read zll the way trough , bu6 i have read a good deal ."
9084,415,agent_2,"me too , my grandma got md into the hbait of reading a little before bed , every night . so , i try to ekep that up ."
9085,415,agent_1,"it is a good habit . did you lnow that appke became known as an apple because when translatwd into latin , malus means aple and evil ."
9086,415,agent_2,did not know that tidbit . wknder how many othee things get dhanged or lost in translation ?
9087,415,agent_1,probably a lt tat we dont even realize . i wonder if it as tings like that that caused teddy roosevelt and john quincy adams to not se the bilbe to be sworn in on .
9088,415,agent_2,"ikd , wonder whawt they uswd , instead ?"
9089,415,agent_1,"i dont know . ij heard that with some of the swearing ins n the most rec3nt congress some peple uwed a law book , otyers the koran ."
9090,415,agent_2,"wohder what oel thomas jefferson would have thought about thbat ? you know he used a eazor to cut out the parts he thought were , supernatural ."
9091,415,agent_1,"i know , taht woulx be w lot of significant stuff . anyway , ih ave to get going , good chat !"
9092,416,agent_1,i think tom brady is the best . i lobe ji spla nforl ife
9093,416,agent_2,i agree . hist b12 method is very motivational
9094,416,agent_1,i want to read his ' athlete's bible ' for my own life
9095,416,agent_2,i want to see his ' tom vs . times how on facehbook
9096,416,agent_1,he is a very spiritual person .
9097,416,agent_2,"' so if yu're going to conpete against m3 , yiu better be willing to giv eup your life , because he is giving up his . ' veryg ood quote"
9098,416,agent_1,i agree wit hmcdaniel when he said that he is a great exampe
9099,416,agent_2,well he is friends with mcdaniel who is he pastor of richmond community cyurch
9100,416,agent_1,well he is doing what it takes to stay a the top of his game at age 40
9101,416,agent_2,coupled with avocado ice cream as well .
9102,416,agent_1,did you know that teh visiting footbapll geams is completely painted pink ?
9103,416,agent_2,wow . i wonder why ? i did not know that espn created the superimposed yellow line reprdsejting rhe first donw line
9104,416,agent_1,yes good invention . i would have called it quits in that georgi atech cumberland game
9105,416,agent_2,that 9s something . the lost 2220 . that is crazy !
9106,416,agent_1,what is wrong is howt he cheereaders cant eat with the playets
9107,416,agent_2,yeah the have to leave when they come in . i will researc why
9108,416,agent_1,well i would have rather had been a bowler instead of a football playe3r in the 60's
9109,416,agent_2,or a engineer . the lifetime earnings are higher
9110,416,agent_1,the bible 9s the bsst sleling book wver . i have a opy .
9111,416,agent_2,i think eberyone does except for teddy roosevelt and john quincy adas
9112,416,agent_1,well thomas jefferson created his own version of the bible . i hguess he do not truly believe
9113,417,agent_1,how familiar are you wkth football ?
9114,417,agent_2,i aj kinda familiar . sometimes i watch . maybs the sb if i have a chance . what about you ?
9115,417,agent_1,i am pretty much the same .; any fqvorite team or position ?
9116,417,agent_2,don't have a fvorite team . usually root for the underdog in the s . i think that the pats have reached the end of their reihn . brady is too old .
9117,417,agent_1,"really ? i hink even aside fom brady , they have had a lot of talented people over the years like green ellis"
9118,417,agent_2,"true , but all dynastie end . i suppose bill b could find another qb , but i doubt he will e as good as brady ."
9119,417,agent_1,but their end probably isn't now
9120,417,agent_2,when do you think the dynasty will end ?
9121,417,agent_1,probably after 2 key plaers change and tje coach retirfes probably . i won't say they will keep winning thr super bowl but i think their performance will go a long way
9122,417,agent_2,how long ?
9123,417,agent_1,"hard to sy , but i think they stoll havde a good shot at the next supebowl"
9124,417,agent_2,good to know . i'll bet accordingly .
9125,417,agent_1,pleasse dom't bet according to my opinion and do so sbsed on your research
9126,417,agent_2,that us sound advice . i will do my dresearch on tom brady and the gang before i wager my kids' collrge fund . the bible tells us not to net foolishly on great contests determined b divine will .
9127,417,agent_1,"i personally woulnd't wager on sporte games , more than i would be willing to lose anyway . do you read the bible ofte n?"
9128,417,agent_2,only in preparaion for the super bowl . ther3 is much wisdom to guide us in predicting the outcoen of sportin events .
9129,417,agent_1,yes there is a lot of chance too
9130,417,agent_2,"the bible leaves nothing to chance for al lis known , and that knw;ledge is shared to those that are true . i know hat the bible will guide me to selecting the victor of the great conte3sts played in our beloved country . those who lac kfaith will overlook hte truth that ckuld have been theirs but isn't ."
9131,417,agent_1,"in that case , goodl uck inb your endeavors . thanks for chattin g."
9132,417,agent_2,"yes , indeed . we had a chat ."
9133,417,agent_1,have a nice day .
9134,418,agent_1,"hi , how are you ? what do you kn0ow about the bible ?"
9135,418,agent_2,a little bit but not as much as i probbalky should .
9136,418,agent_1,"dird ypou kno wthat before 1963 , it was not uncommon for us students to be required to 5ea dfrom rhe bible as part of their elementary efducation ? the country sure has changed ."
9137,418,agent_2,i did not . i wonder waht the religious makeup for the u . s . was at that time ? i wonder if it's more diverse no3w and therefore not very inclusive .
9138,418,agent_1,"very true . i expect that at 5he time , it was accepted . now immigration has changed things ."
9139,418,agent_2,i wuld imagine so . i did hear that jefferson crezatedh is own version of the bible .
9140,418,agent_1,"he cut out he 'supernaturl; parts , such as the miracles and the resurrection . he wanted to se3e religion in humanist t3erms ."
9141,418,agent_2,it's an interesting approach . i wonder how much it wa san artempt to understand it or make it more palatabe or an attempt to make it his own which i am not sure is okay in christianiy .
9142,418,agent_1,it would not be ok . his changes would make it a different faith . othe rpresidents have taken a simu;lar attitude towardt he bible ; presidents teddy roosevelt and john quincy adams did not use a bible at their swearingin ceremonies . i think they swore on the constitution .
9143,418,agent_2,i suppose they should be given the opportunity to be sworn on whatever they eblieve in . not everyone believes the same thing . i have heard people complain about politicians being sworn in on religious texts that were not the bible but i don't see the problem at all .
9144,418,agent_1,the loyalty should be to the leople and the country .
9145,418,agent_2,i totally agee . did you mnow that the tower of babel ws pikely based on a rel building ?
9146,418,agent_1,"i expect that manyt hings in the bible have some connection to things in the world historically . they might appear in a different guise . the langiage of the bible changes . for example , an apple only became known as an ' aple ' when the bible was translated itno latin jn th4e 4th century . the reason : thw word ' malus ' means both appel and evil . that is an interesting coincidence ."
9147,418,agent_2,wow ! that is very interezting . so i wonder if it was entirely a metaphor rather than a fruit at all ?
9148,418,agent_1,i would think that's a good possibility . earlier readers might have understood the plwy on eords .
9149,418,agent_2,"interesting . bh the way , theb uilding that they believe the tower of babel is based on iz the etemenanki in iraq ."
9150,418,agent_1,that sounds reasonable . it would be located somewhere in the middle east . i wonder what it looks l9k .
9151,418,agent_2,that's a very good questiion . i had no ideq it was based on a real building until very recently so i have never looked . i will definitwly look into it .
9152,418,agent_1,"yes , please do . anyway , thanks for he chat ! have a good dway !"
9153,418,agent_2,"hefore you go , ij ust wanted to note that i have met many people that did not reaoize that christianity and judaims were so closely linked and use many of the same yexts . it's always shockingt o me ."
9154,418,agent_1,i believe it . the pentateuch is the virst five books of the bible .
9155,418,agent_2,that's a good point because i believe that sand the torah are the same .
9156,419,agent_1,"hello , are you a fan of the nfl ?"
9157,419,agent_2,"i like to watch football , yeah , no tmy favoritr sport but its nice"

9163,419,agent_2,"yeah , i hae heard about him , he also played for the patriots right ?"
9164,419,agent_1,yeah and he is the guy that never fumbled the bal lin his career
9165,419,agent_2,"he never fumbled a ball ! wow , that is amazing , i dontk no wmuch about football , but that seems like a hard quest ."
9166,419,agent_1,it sure does and good forh im .d o you know thje visitor locker room at u og iowa is pink ?
9167,419,agent_2,"it is ? that sounds like a great tactic to mkae th eother tea mmad , college football sounds fun ,"
9168,419,agent_1,i think that is what it is . do you know what tyhe highest score i nfootball is ?
9169,419,agent_2,"nok , not really i know more about soccer tahn football but if you know can you please tell me ?"
9170,419,agent_1,the highest score is 2220 when georgia tech bea tcumberland . what a game
9171,419,agent_2,"thats ounds likje a massacre lol , and also a really boring game , who looses by 222 points ?"
9172,419,agent_1,i know right ? on another topic do you know much about fhe bible ?
9173,419,agent_2,"no not really , i did rear some verzes when i was a little kid , are you a religious person ?"
9174,419,agent_1,"i am not actually , just know some facts about hte bible , how it was in the education systwem until 1963"
9175,419,agent_2,"i do remember as tory about the babel tower , i then learn that might be ar eal towe r."
9176,419,agent_1,yeah it seems it is the etmeenanki in the modern day iraq
9177,419,agent_2,"it must be a really nice building , a lot of history in one place , really interesting indeed ."
9178,420,agent_1,"hey , have you heard about that new lifestyle plan that tom brady came up with ?"
9179,420,agent_2,hi ! no i have not . what is it ?
9180,420,agent_1,he's called it6 ' the tb1w method ' . sounds a little crazy to be treating footbaol a sa lifeswtyle .
9181,420,agent_2,do you know how many teams are in the nfl ?
9182,420,agent_1,"16 in the nfc and 16 in the afc , so that makes 32 !"
9183,420,agent_2,how many teams got o the play offs ?
9184,420,agent_1,"the nc and the afc each send 6 , so there are 12 teams in the playoffs for the super bowl ."
9185,420,agent_2,th eaverage nfl gaem only has 11 minutes of live gameplay .
9186,420,agent_1,"they sure can drag those 11 minutes out !m aybe that's why tom brady is doim gso well for 40 , idf he's only playing 11 minutes a game ."
9187,420,agent_2,true ! did you know tha tthe new orlenas saits cheerleaders are forbidden from eating in the same restaurant as an nfl player ?
9188,420,agent_1,no i didn't ! that seems a little extreme .
9189,420,agent_2,"i agre e. and if thedy are already at the restaurant eating , they have to get up anjd leav eif a player comes in ."
9190,420,agent_1,gosh . i wonder why tey do that .
9191,420,agent_2,very strict . do you read the bible ?
9192,420,agent_1,i've read parts of it . i don't know enough of the old greek to really get a true translation .
9193,420,agent_2,i find it really hard to read . i have tried but it's hard to met o undertand what it's trying to say . maybe i need to read the kid version haha .
9194,420,agent_1,"elemnetary students used to ead it class up unyil 1963 , so maybe it is th3 kid's version !"
9195,420,agent_2,did you know thomas jeffetson created his own version of the bible ?
9196,420,agent_1,lots of the foundign fathers had some weird religious ideas . wha tdid jefferson do ?
9197,420,agent_2,"using a razpr , he cut out hte 'supernatural' parts , such as miracles and ther esurrection ."
9198,420,agent_1,"yeah , that sounds pretty weird . it'sn o good to pick and choose what to follow ."
9199,421,agent_1,dro you watch football ?
9200,421,agent_2,yes i do and unfortunately the chiers are playing the pat's this sunday !
9201,421,agent_1,i'm not too into footal las it doesn't really catch my attention . there are only 11 minutes of live gameplay on average n each game . i know many fans and players view the sport almosta s a religion though .
9202,421,agent_2,that is fridiculous . tom brady s starting to bepieve his own press . his tb12 method is like he is selling his success in an almost cultish way . ia m asure he is close to retirement and now starts selling a book .
9203,421,agent_1,"yeah , he says hi sathlete's bible helps him to stay at the top of his game ."
9204,421,agent_2,a true fact is that in th e'60s top bowlers made twice as much as football stars . i think the game has becom emore popular as people workm onday friday and tv watchkng has grown .
9205,421,agent_1,that is inwane hat we have gotten so serious about football; since then . so much that we have tracking chips in players shoulder pads and inside footballs .
9206,421,agent_2,"what is amazing that with allt hre money thrown around , an engibeer over his lifetime earns more that the average fnl player ."
9207,421,agent_1,that is interesting . i think it's silly to worship nfl players . it's amazin gthat someone thought that espn needed an emmy for making hte superimpose dyellow line !
9208,421,agent_2,"that is funnmy since actors work for years to get one ! did you know that for th new orlean's tam , the cheerleaders cann9t eat at the same restairqnt ast he playerd ? if th player comes in , they must leave the restaurant . i wonder what the rationale i s?"
9209,421,agent_1,"that seens kind ofs exist ! speakig of sexis m, i wish more people were into women's sports . women can play in the nfl if they meet the requirements but i'm not sure if that will happen ."
9210,421,agent_2,atl east there is no written rule that women can't play in hte nfl . meeting th erquirements would be difficult !
9211,421,agent_1,"yeah , i heard that there is a talented kicker who might change that . speaking of talented players , benjarvus greenellis has never fumbled thef ootball in his nfl career ."
9212,421,agent_2,"i wonder how much he gets to p,ay ? speaking of tom brady becoming his own religion , did you know that teddy roosevelt and john quincy adams are the only twok presidents thatd id not use ab ible to be sworn into office ?"
9213,421,agent_1,"i woder why that is ! yeah , tom brady wants to fidn the meaning of life through his own way , throuhg football ."
9214,421,agent_2,"and he will hwve a lot o followes ! did you know that thomas jefferson cresated his own version of the bible cuttin gout the supernatural parts m miracles , ?"
9215,421,agent_1,"hmm , that is kinxd of extreme . though , hwat is regarded as canonical varies depending on different traditiosn and grpups ."
9216,421,agent_2,it is also thought that an apple became known as an ap0le when the bible was translated into layin . malus means bt happle and evil in latin .
9217,421,agent_1,"i find it interesint how the hebrew bible , greek septuagint and hristian old testament all overlap"
9218,421,agent_2,the biblical towe of babel is likoely w real building the etemenanki in iraq . yes it is interesting how many faiths overlap !
9219,421,agent_1,evena mong christian denominations tyhere is disagreement about what should be inc;uded .
9220,422,agent_1,do you like football ?
9221,422,agent_2,"goodm orning ! i do enjoy a gpod football gam eand while i am not a patriots fan , i certainly alpreciate hiw goo dthey and tom brady are ."
9222,422,agent_1,i like the patriots . they are like fhe lanisters of football .
9223,422,agent_2,"sweet got reference ! i think tb and coach bilichek are in a powers truggle now and neither wants to bel eft out in the cold , while wantig to prove that they can wi nwithout the othe3r ."
9224,422,agent_1,ui can see that
9225,422,agent_2,i've learned that tb is achiefing cultl ik estatus among the fitness or health comkmunityf or his foutine an dregumen that keepsh im in top shape that translates to winningf on thje footbal lfield
9226,422,agent_1,well he ia an exper tand hws proved it given his performane
9227,422,agent_2,"it make me wonder , with his lie so seemingly perfect , career , family , celebrity , , if a scandal is on the horizon again . bigger than deflategate , more like the one that his osner , robert kraft just got tantled up in ?"
9228,422,agent_1,who knows . i feelt hat sometimes ceepbrities got it hard with their lives under a microscop eand paparazzi .
9229,422,agent_2,"i tcould also be vecauss so epeopel are very jealous of others success , that they look for way to brng tbem down . some critics of tb are pretty strongly against him"
9230,422,agent_1,that is a shqme .
9231,422,agent_2,"i ca nunderstand some of tne criticism , especially from football purists that want athletes to just shut up and ply the game . times have changed and today it'sa ll about brand and q ratings"
9232,422,agent_1,so is there any team of player you follow in particular ?
9233,422,agent_2,"3e did not have a loval team whwre i grew up , nor did my family have an allegiance to a team wo i don't r3ally have a favorite per se . but now , ,ivin gin phoenix , i cannot help but follow the cardinals , althouug i don't really root for them some oft heir players are very popular . you ?"
9234,422,agent_1,i personally like the patriots
9235,422,agent_2,right ! wat's not o like the pinnacle of success and achiev4ment . the boston wsports scene has had a lot of recent success
9236,422,agent_1,teh lanisters of football
9237,422,agent_2,"yes ! the analogy between football and religion is very true for some fans ,a nd now that tb has his ' bible ' , it's even more prevalent maong n efans i suppose"
9238,422,agent_1,i mean xome fans are very dedicated . some evem play fantasy football .
9239,422,agent_2,"i play fgantazy footbsall , vut am totally able to separate fantasy from real8ty . i have a great time playing im the league with my good friends !"
9240,422,agent_1,"indeed . in ny case , thanks for chatting ."
9241,423,agent_1,"hello , do you wathc th enfl ?"
9242,423,agent_2,"i do , i lov dthe nfl , love football , what about you ?"
9243,423,agent_1,yes me too . did you know women can 0lay too ?
9244,423,agent_2,like in an actuzlo league game ? they can ? there's no rule against it ;
9245,423,agent_1,"nope htere is no written rule so if they qualify , then they are allowed to play"
9246,423,agent_2,"oh i see , that is interesting"
9247,423,agent_1,"mzybe there are some tough women out there , you never know . do you know what th ehighest score in an nfal game is ?"
9248,423,agent_2,"its 222 to 0 right ? i recallw atching a documentary about that , it was georigia tech against some otger team"
9249,423,agent_1,yeah they played against the cumberland and totally crushed them and went into histr7
9250,423,agent_2,no one wants to be remembered as the team that lost by 222 points
9251,423,agent_1,yeah exactly . do you know who benjarvus greenellis is ?
9252,423,agent_2,"no , who is he ? is he a fooytball player on the 222 point losing team ?"
9253,423,agent_1,actually he was a qb fort he patriots who never fumbled the ball
9254,423,agent_2,"o hi see , never fumbled ? wow , that is amazing , i wonder why i never heard of himb efore , i have tog oogleh i mup now"
9255,423,agent_1,yeah he wss pretty amazing . apparently bowlers made more than football players back in hte 60s
9256,423,agent_2,"theyd id ? well football wnat a popular sport back then , at least not as popular as it is now so it does make eense , i dont see a bowler making more money than az pro football player now"
9257,423,agent_1,"yeah things have really changed now . on another topic , dl you know much abou5t the bible ?"
9258,423,agent_2,"non ot r3ally , my grandmother used to be really religious but im not , i have read some verses of hte sacred book though"
9259,423,agent_1,o hi see . did you know that in school it was part of the ptrogram ebfore 1963 ?
9260,423,agent_2,"i didnt knlw ghat , what are your thoughts on this ? i think religiom should be imposed"
9261,423,agent_1,i like the fact that it i slo longer the case . religioh should be a free choice .
9262,424,agent_1,hi . do you like football ? are you familiar with the nfl ?
9263,424,agent_2,"nfl ? is that the national football league ? yes , i 've heard of it . thd footvall that i know is with a round ball ."
9264,424,agent_1,oh okay . the nfl is a professional americanh football league .
9265,424,agent_2,now i am understand . the amrrican football is the nfl . i am not so failiar with it .
9266,424,agent_1,it has 32 teams . thry have games from september to december .
9267,424,agent_2,its ound like intense . is it a game that many peopel watch ?
9268,424,agent_1,jost americansw atch the games . nfl and football are very popular in the united states .
9269,424,agent_2,i am impressed . this game must be very good . do you have a tea mthat you like ?
9270,424,agent_1,i like 49ers since i used to live in san francisco . they are not very good though . i was a long time ago since they won thes uperbowl . they belong to the nf aslp .
9271,424,agent_2,san francisco sounds like a great team . other cities have teams . who is the best team now ?
9272,424,agent_1,the patriots . they won five championships .
9273,424,agent_2,they have won the most championships ? and they are theb est now ? i guess everybody admires them for their prowess .
9274,424,agent_1,yes . are you familiar wiht tom brady ? he is their qb .
9275,424,agent_2,"i do not know . well , maybe i have heard the name but not know . the qb ? is it a special thing ?"
9276,424,agent_1,it stands for quarterback . quharterbacks are laders of offensive temas .
9277,424,agent_2,he is a leader . i guesst his is why the patriots ar4e so good at championing .
9278,424,agent_1,i think so . tim brady is the team's quarterback .
9279,424,agent_2,there is a tim and a tom ? are they brothers ? it must be hard to share leadership . htis is spexcial glaent tjey hav e.
9280,424,agent_1,it was a typo . what i meant was tom brady . he was the quarterback who leadt he team to five superbowl championshipes .
9281,424,agent_2,i think this game of nfl and the teams anx tom or tim bradys sounds like a very american spo4ts . nmuch courage and leadership . thank you for teaching this things to me .
9282,424,agent_1,i've got to run . it was nice chattign wit hyou .
9283,424,agent_2,please run ! thanks
9284,424,agent_1,you can read more about fnl on the internet . sorry for the typo . the quarterback of the patriots is tom brady . bye .
9285,425,agent_1,are you a tom brady fan .
9286,425,agent_2,"yes , i reallya dmire his hard woriings kills amdh is comnitment to the team and sp0ort as i've come to learn in the documentary ' tom vs time ' have you seen it ?"
9287,425,agent_1,"i have not seen it but k5t sounds interesting . apparenlty football has necome his religion , what ever thatr means ."
9288,425,agent_2,"football has become his religion an dfor some , tom brady has ebcome their religion or somebody they worship . there's even a creed for the patriot's coach ' in bi,l we trust ' , that' seems a little extreme to me ."
9289,425,agent_1,yeaht hat ahnd the fact the some fans have deemed him their messiah .
9290,425,agent_2,"crazy ! butn ot as crazy as how the saints cheerleacders are treated , did you hdar about that ?"
9291,425,agent_1,yeah i thkink that's pretty sexisf . way beyond the confines of fraternization .
9292,425,agent_2,"yeah exactly ! but thehn again at the same time , women are allowed o play in the nfl , though i don't think i have heard anybody coming close to joinijnt the leag8ue , have you ?"
9293,425,agent_1,i hav enot and i'm not being sexist i hope they don't . they last thing i want t0 see is 135lb poun dwr being hit by a 295l;b linebacker . i do think they shkuld form a league like tghe wnba . what do you think ?
9294,425,agent_2,"i understand what you mean , but i think there would be somd physical requirements you have to meet in 9rder to play , or i mean , survive an attack from p0 pound lieabcker ! another way of lo9king at it is women are smart enough to not play that intensive sport ! if there was a wnfl , i don't think the ratings would be too hot compared ton fl ."
9295,425,agent_1,i do even more so than the wnba . but i agree with what you said about wkmem being smart enough to stay away from it . especially now that we know for sure about the brain injuries that it can cause .
9296,425,agent_2,"yeah , even with only 11 minutes of live gameplay , i don't think it's worth the risk . but even still , eleven minutes of live gameplay and i devote my entire sunday to the sport !"
9297,425,agent_1,"i know right , i just don't see how those figures can be right . ahve you ever had avocado ice cream ?"
9298,425,agent_2,"yeah , i think it'sz a little ovf too . no , is avocado icecream the next big thing ? like poke ?"
9299,425,agent_1,poek ? no apparently tom brady swears by it it's part of his tb12 method program .
9300,425,agent_2,"the sushi thing that came from hawaii or something , called poke . oh wow ., is that his diet regimen ? tb12 ?"
9301,425,agent_1,"it's part of tbe plan he has for his life . joy , peak performznces and plenty of avocado ice cream ,"
9302,425,agent_2,"oh wow , i wondewr if avocado prices incereased as a result of his book , do you know by chance ?"
9303,425,agent_1,i don't for sure but i would gather theyd id . you know the highest scoring foogtball game was a college game in 1916 ?
9304,425,agent_2,how high of a score did the game get to ?
9305,425,agent_1,georgia tech ut a hurting on cumberland 2200 .
9306,425,agent_2,"wow , they didn't even acore any po9ints ! i think my pride would bw quite rbuised if i was on the losing team ."
9307,426,agent_1,"hlelo , how ae you ? do you like football ?"
9308,426,agent_2,yeah foobal lis prwtty col and fun tow atch . can't say i would be willing to make a religion out of it though l
9309,426,agent_1,dis you wa6tc hthe superbowl ?
9310,426,agent_2,super bowl lii yes i watched it .5 he patriots won agaisnft the flacons .
9311,426,agent_1,are you a patriots fan ? what is your favorite team ?
9312,426,agent_2,i did like the patriots before but then bradry decided to start q religion based on football . . ? that's jus6 a bit strange for me gou know ?
9313,426,agent_1,i agree . i still like the pats they are my home team . did you know in the 60's the best bowlers made more than tye top nfl players ?
9314,426,agent_2,"really ? wow i had no idea tht bowlers made so much mon4y . i did hear that there was a football game that endedw 220 , that's litterally one for the record books ."
9315,426,agent_1,wow that's amazing . i can't believe tht espn won an emmy for creating the yellow first down line .
9316,426,agent_2,"yeah , that's an interesting thinbg o win an emmy fo r. you know they say a footballg ame only has 11 min7utss of gameplay . . . but that only counts the time the ball is oving ."
9317,426,agent_1,"wo that's inrdible . four hours of tv for only 11 minutes of game play , incredilbe !"
9318,426,agent_2,"yeah . . . there's also all kinds of wacky r8les 9n the nfl as well . for example , cheerleaders of the saints can't eat in the sem restaurant as an nfl plyer . weird , huh ?"
9319,426,agent_1,that's bizarre and sexit . did you know the universkty of iowa's locker room for the visiyingt eam is painted all pink ?
9320,426,agent_2,really ? weird you'd think with such a macho sport it would be som etough color . . . but perhaps itsa n attemptt o demoralize the opposing tean . i do know the nfl has trakcing chips to record the players on thje field .
9321,426,agent_1,i would agree with the demoralizing . did you know thefe is no rule against women playing in the nfl if they can make the requirements ?
9322,426,agent_2,"yeah . . . they're techncally allowed to play but sof ar none havem et the requirements and actually made ann fl team . i'mg uessing the requirememts for the patriots include saying ' in bill wet rust ' , hahaha ."
9323,426,agent_1,did you know that benjarvus greenellis has never fumbled ?
9324,426,agent_2,"really ? pretty impressive for someone with a career as along ae his to have played that ,onh and never fumbeld once ."
9325,426,agent_1,"i like the patriots and all but some of that stuff is just beyond me . i really enjoy warching th egame , but some people take it too far . supposedly tom brady is never eaten as trawberry , so weird ."
9326,426,agent_2,"wow , that is pretty strange . it really shows the divide we have begween cel4ebrities and 'regular people' . still , that tb12 methodw ould not sell of some random person wrote it and not tom brazdy ."
9327,426,agent_1,"i don't really care about ceebrities , they are jjst people . i didn't even know he ' wrote ' a book , and to call it a bible how distasteful ."
9328,426,agent_2,"yeha . . .h e can get away with it because he's fanous . i'd hate to see what people would do to me if i did that . but hey peopel seem to beieve it , or a tleast bleieve that brady believes in it ."
9329,426,agent_1,"i just don't get that ata ol celebrities are just people , some are good athlretes or actors or what ever tne case it's crazy the lengths some people go to , to idolizec elebs ."
9330,426,agent_2,"yeh , peopld do some crazy thingst o praise cekebrities . well i th8n kwe both have other things to get back to so 'll talk to you later ok ?"
9331,426,agent_1,"sounds good , tqke care ."
9332,426,agent_2,alright .
9333,427,agent_1,"hello , are you a fan of the nfl ?"
9334,427,agent_2,"i am , i eeally enjoy the heart and soul of the game . i truly believe that it's a divinme game . and you ?"
9335,427,agent_1,i love the game too . do you have a favorite team o rplayer ?
9336,427,agent_2,i do . i?m a patriots fan true and bpue . i believe that i can truly be its own religion .
9337,427,agent_1,yeah i love the patriots and brady too . did you know he is the author 9c a book as well now ?
9338,427,agent_2,"i recenlty saw that . it really amkes sense , i mea , who doesn't want to be like tom brady , i can understand why some peop.e see him as a kind of messiah . do you think he's charismatic ?"
9339,427,agent_1,"yeah i think so , he has made a career evdrywhere . did you knoww omen can play in the nfl too ?"
9340,427,agent_2,interestjn ! i hadn't realized that . though i think they would have a tough time meeting the el.igibility reauireemnts . did you kno wthey track players movements with chipz ? very 1984
9341,427,agent_1,yeah i thinkt hey are cllecting stats like velocity and rotation and such . i hope they can use that data to maek thegame safer
9342,427,agent_2,"yeah , but should football really be safe ? think of all the moneyt hey geft paid ! it'sf or 8r entertainmetn !"
9343,427,agent_1,i know but just to spare them the concussions . in the 60s bowlers made more money thna footabll players
9344,427,agent_2,"wow ! thoug hi suppos etheir average ti,e is short actually playing in the nfl . in the llng run an engineer will make more . hut stil l. i suppose you would want to make the game as safe as bowping ?"
9345,427,agent_1,"i am not sure 8i fthat would work , bowling is a oretty slow game . did 6you hear about that gam ebetween geofrgia tech and cumberland back in 1916 ?"
9346,427,agent_2,2220 ! insane ! did you know that greenellis never once fumbled ? these kind of stats are what really makes me interested in football .
9347,427,agent_1,yeah hte guy is a legend for sure . did you know espn won an emmy for the yellow line ?
9348,427,agent_2,"wow ! and whne you consider that for only 11 miutes of gameplay , i gyuess i can see winning an emmy for that kind of exposure . do you think the bible has any place in football ?"
9349,427,agent_1,i honestly cannot make a relation there but on the other hand i know it is th4e best selling book w3ith over 5 billion copies sold
9350,427,agent_2,"crazy ! i mean , maybe the jefferon version , where it's justg ood advice . i could deal with that as part of football ."
9351,427,agent_1,yeah the guy really did notl ike hte supernatural stuff to go anc ut those ou6 with a razor . wow
9352,427,agent_2,"it's insane , b7ut you know what he founder a great university , so someone must have bneen on his side ! like brady , you cwan' tbe that successful without god n your corner , i suppose !"
9353,427,agent_1,i gues sso . roosevelt and quincy seemed no tto be religious either as they passed on swearing in with a bible .
9354,427,agent_2,"wdll , you are asked to swear or affirm . so i can see the logic i nit , i syppose ."
9355,427,agent_1,"yeah , it is good that they have that option . nice chay ."
9356,428,agent_1,are you familiar with football ?
9357,428,agent_2,"hi , hnow ar eyou ? yes ia m . i sometimes watch . what about you ?"
9358,428,agent_1,i have a passing knowledge myself
9359,428,agent_2,ok . did you know that the nfl has no written rule against femlae players ? wome nwould be allowed if they met the league's eligibility requirmeents .
9360,428,agent_1,"i did , but i don' tknow i those requirements don't inherently disqualify women anyway"
9361,428,agent_2,true . i don't know what the requirements . probably women could ply noncontact positiojs .
9362,428,agent_1,pehraps but all positions risk contact
9363,428,agent_2,"kickers and punters have li8mited risk , though it is poss9ble ,b ut unlikely , that they mihgt have to tackle someone ;"
9364,428,agent_1,"i gyuess that is true , but that could be a liability ?"
9365,428,agent_2,"ok , yes . it could . i'm no advocating thazt women . play . inf act , they'd be better off as engineers probably . the aveage lifetime earnings of an engineer is hgigher than the average lifetime earnings of an nfl player ."
9366,428,agent_1,probably due to injury related early retiremetn
9367,428,agent_2,truje . engineers have fewer conbcusxions .
9368,428,agent_1,much less indeed .
9369,428,agent_2,"true . engineers probably don't have to content with pink locker rooms ekther , or with tracking chips in their clothing ."
9370,428,agent_1,i wonder what the nf luses all hat data for
9371,428,agent_2,probably sels it to spy agencies in north korea . somethingl ike that . maybe for4 trainint coaches .
9372,428,agent_1,lol . but ya i hope they use it to lower the rate of physical injuries and concussions .
9373,428,agent_2,the tracking would be good for video game design . kno whow players really move . model it in a game .
9374,428,agent_1,perhaps gaming companies already have to make football games
9375,428,agent_2,they might have the data . tha twould b einteresting . i wish they hqad attached snsors to bowlers back in the 60s to understand how they bowled . they were superstars .
9376,428,agent_1,"lol . i guese htag is true . in any case , htanjsk for chatting . have a nice day ."
9377,429,agent_1,are yu a football fan ?
9378,429,agent_2,you mean american football or the one with the roun dball ?
9379,429,agent_1,am footblal . do you know how tom brady is ? him and the pztriots just won th esuper bow l.
9380,429,agent_2,tom brady ? is he the coach of the patriots ? i guess he must be a pretty good ckach then .
9381,429,agent_1,"no he's the quarterback , he led his team to i believe their 4th or 5th super nopwl ."
9382,429,agent_2,he must be a very good 1 or 4back then . he plays for the patriot s? are they in new york ?
9383,429,agent_1,new ngland . heyd id you know that top bowler made twice as much as top nfl payers in the 60's ?
9384,429,agent_2,ia m not surprised . bowling is a difficult and dangerous sport . i would expect that bowlers should be compensated for the risk .
9385,429,agent_1,"right i forgoit the floor is pretty slippery , lol ! the iowa state coach yhad the visiting locker eoom painjted pink ."
9386,429,agent_2,iowa is a pretty pink state in general . i guess that is to raise awareness of breast cancer .
9387,429,agent_1,i'm pretty sure it was a psychological straregy . i think they're putting tracking chips inside th efootballs as well ;
9388,429,agent_2,iowa pur teacking chips in the footballs ? ! isn't that cheating ? they shouldr not have that advantage .
9389,429,agent_1,"sorry i meant the nfl is not only putting tracking chips in hte shoulder pads but also the footballs , lol !"
9390,429,agent_2,"oh , ok . i guess the nfl is worried about losing footballs . i thougnht they were pretty easy to keep track of . the players need to be tracked ? i guess they get around quote a bit , too ."
9391,429,agent_1,"they will erecord a playersm ovements on the field and the veloxity , rotatin and blals peed ."
9392,429,agent_2,"o k, that's good . the players should have their privacy . htat would be worse than facebook ! lol i guess they use that data for all kinds o fstrategizing ."
9393,429,agent_1,yeah apparently tom rbady has a thig for avocado ice ceeam . have you ever had it ?
9394,429,agent_2,"what ? that sounds awful . why avocado ice cream ? why not strawberry ? that's natural . well , he's the coach . he ca ndo what he wants ."
9395,429,agent_1,' quarterback ' you know the patriots also produce a br fhat never fumbled the ball in his career .
9396,429,agent_2,"oh , he isn't the ' full ' coach . i get ya . isn't the rb sup0posed to fumbl ethe ball ? isn;t that how ghey get it to the receiver ?"
9397,429,agent_1,"nota t all , but thanks for making this a good chat . the rb or running bacjk runs the abll into the end zone with out fumbling it ."
9398,430,agent_1,"hello , do you watch football ?"
9399,430,agent_2,"not too often , but i'k famliar with some of it because my rbo is a big fan , even got a football scholarship in colelge . ,"
9400,430,agent_1,"oh nice , that is a sweet deal . does he go to u of iowa by any chance ?"
9401,430,agent_2,"no , he choose u of arknasas to attne d. this was back in the mid ninetkes or so . . can't remember the exact date . , why , did you o to u of iowa or something ?"
9402,430,agent_1,no i was just wondering because htey have that visitor locker room that is painted pink
9403,430,agent_2,"oh , yeah , i heard about that ! that's kind of funny . i ead somewhere tehy did an experiment where tgey painted a weight liftign room pink and foudn that th eeeight lighters suddenly couldn' tlift as much as before . guess iowa i trying to psyche ouft ig's opponents . hehe ."
9404,430,agent_1,nice did not know about that other one but explaisn he reasoning behind it . do you know what the highest score in football yistory s or
9405,430,agent_2,"actually , i do . it wa like 222 to zero . someone got beat prety badly ! i wonder if the other team was even trying or if they're opponents were just that ooe . . ."
9406,430,agent_1,yeah it was georgia tech that beat cumberalnd . i bet you they are still bragbing about thatt o this day
9407,430,agent_2,"you know espn won an emmy cor creating the yellow line representing first down . it's amazing waht they can do withg raphics nowawdays during football games . i remember when all we had where the wite cualk lines , usually wit hjoe montana narrating , . lol"
9408,430,agent_1,"yeah go figure , things have moved along pretty fast for sure . do you know who bnejarvus greenelolis is ?"
9409,430,agent_2,"i'm asshming he's a footbsl player , but o6ther than that . . . , shrugs ,"
9410,430,agent_1,yeah hue is a former qb who never fumbled the balol in his career
9411,430,agent_2,"that's pretty amazing ! you know what's crazy though ? for asl ong as games last , theres actually only about 11 minutes of live game play for each game ."
9412,430,agent_1,that is mind blowing and yet we are glued to the tv for so long .
9413,430,agent_2,"waht's alson eat is how closely they keep track o everything in theg ame . i mean , thy got chips in the shoulder pad sof the players and inside he football sto track speed rotation , etc . i guess there's nothing that doesn't get recorded somehow !"
9414,430,agent_1,yeah that is pretty cool . i hope htey can use those stats to mwke the game safer too . did you hear about that rule for new orleans cheerleaders ?
9415,430,agent_2,"no , what was that all about ?"
9416,430,agent_1,ell htey are not allowed to eat in the same restaurant as the pkayers
9417,430,agent_2,"wow , that's pretty stric ! guess they're really big ont hat ' n fraternizing ' rule ! can't imagine why they'd want the playsrs to stay away fro mthe attrwctive , young cheedrleaders ! lol"
9418,430,agent_1,yeah i guess but still very odd rule if you ask me
9419,431,agent_1,are you a football fan ?
9420,431,agent_2,"yes , i love football ! did you know that female players are lalowed , there just aren't any that have met eligibility requirements ."
9421,431,agent_1,iw onder wghat the eligibility requ8rements are . i think there wil;l be a female kicker someday .
9422,431,agent_2,that would be awesome to see ! first new orlenas needs to get with the times and give their cheerl3aders normal rights and not make htem subserviant to the players
9423,431,agent_1,"absolutely , making a saints cheerlesader leavge a resaurant if a saints player comes in is just foolish and shouldb e illegal ."
9424,431,agent_2,should be illegal ! did you know in the 9160s bowlers made more than foobtaqll players ?
9425,431,agent_1,"wow , that is hard to believe . i am guessign tv revenue changed thwat quickly ."
9426,431,agent_2,probably . speaking of tv . . . did you know that espn won an emmy for their first down yellow line they superimposed 0n tv ?
9427,431,agent_1,i did and that emmy was well deserved . i can't imzgin ewatching football without teh yellow line telling me where the first down is . it makes football more exciting seeing a player stretch and reach for the yellow lihe .
9428,431,agent_2,i love the yellow line so that i know where they need to get to . how do you feel about the using tracking chips in the shoulder pads ?
9429,431,agent_1,"i did not know abouyt the tracking chips . i guess it make sense because sometimes they get the top speed of the running backs or total distance traveled , not in a straight line , and i would guess these trackinhg chips is wahere they get the information ."
9430,431,agent_2,"yes , sometime si think we're getting too techy in tbe sport because they akso have chips in ghe footballs ."
9431,431,agent_1,i wonder with the chips if eventually w ewon't have to rely on the refs to tell if a plwayer broke the plane of the end zone and scored . maybe the chip in the blal can tell us .
9432,431,agent_2,"you'd think taht would already be known since the chips are supposed to tell velo0city , rotation , ball speed , and location . . ? but i wonder who gets that info aqnd when ?"
9433,431,agent_1,interestinjg . maybe the information isn't relayed in real tiem . it woud be neat if there lights srrounding the end zone and when the chip broke the end zone the lights would flash or would be cheesy .
9434,431,agent_2,i think that would be cheesy and too alike to hockey . what do y7oi think of tom brady ?
9435,431,agent_1,i think brady is incredible . he seems to be able to balance his family life wjth a compelte obsession with football . when he said he was going to play until4 5 i di dnot believe i5 but now i am chwnging my mind .
9436,431,agent_2,i'm not a fan of him 2 i want smeone els eto win nd he sees full of himself . . . . brady is a kind of messiah figure for a lot of patriots fans . . .
9437,431,agent_1,i agree that pats think he is a messiah figure but i dojnt' blam ehim for that . i see your point though . a pastor in virginia says there are faith lessons you can learn from brady . i wouldn't go that far . ij ust think he has a lot of skiol and an obsession with football .
9438,431,agent_2,i agree with that and maybe a little too much obsession since he eaid he's willing to give up jis life for footbaqll ?.
9439,431,agent_1,"true , his family life with his supermodel wife and kids is portrayed as perfect , but if ound that a little hard to believe when his whole life revolves around cootball ."
9440,431,agent_2,i completley agree . now i need to go help my famkly lol . nice fhatting with you !
9441,432,agent_1,i enjoy the nfl . are you a fan ?
9442,432,agent_2,i watch them because my son is a big fan and the entire family enjy nfl game s.
9443,432,agent_1,glad tok hear it . out f the 32 temasw hich one is your family rooting for ? i'm a bears fan myself .
9444,432,agent_2,the 49ers rom san francisco because we used go live there .
9445,432,agent_1,that makes sense . are you familiar with the former patriots rb benjarvus greenellis ?
9446,432,agent_2,yes . i heard that he has never fumbledt he ball in his nfl career .
9447,432,agent_1,yes . htat is so impressive . i did not know that was possible ! did you ever hear what the university of iowa did to thei rvisiting locker room ?
9448,432,agent_2,yes . they pain6ed the locker room for visiting teams pink . to intimidate them ?
9449,432,agent_1,"yes they did . i'm assu,ing it's some kind of mind gam e."
9450,432,agent_2,i thimk so .w hat do you think of t6om brady ?
9451,432,agent_1,i'm not a fan . how about yourself ?
9452,432,agent_2,i admire himk for winning five championship . four or five ? i dp not remember .
9453,432,agent_1,i do not evenk now ar this point . it's a lot . i definitely think he is a very good bq . did you hear that he wrote a book ?
9454,432,agent_2,no i did not . please tell me about it .
9455,432,agent_1,he wrote a book called the tb12 method . its' referred to as an athlete's bible .
9456,432,agent_2,what kind of book ks it ?
9457,432,agent_1,i suppose it depends on who you ask . i believe that he believes it's spiritual but a critic called it cult like and creepy .
9458,432,agent_2,what o you think though ?
9459,432,agent_1,"i have not read it so i truly can't make that judgement . off topic , did you kniw that espn won an emmyf or creating the yellow lin3e thar represents thef irst down ?"
9460,432,agent_2,yes i heard about it . the yellow lien was a good ideqa for american football .
9461,432,agent_1,it was an amazing idea . ic an't imagine watching without it . i eould ge completely lost . they deserved that emmy .
9462,432,agent_2,"yes , they did indeed . did you watch the superbowl this year ?"
9463,432,agent_1,i did . it was horrible in every way ha ha .
9464,433,agent_1,"hello , do you watch the nfl ?"
9465,433,agent_2,every wee . how about yo .
9466,433,agent_1,nice . i watch it sometimes only . do you know how many teams are there ?
9467,433,agent_2,yeah there are 32t eams arent there
9468,433,agent_1,yup there are . did you know u of iowan painted their visitor locker room pink ?
9469,433,agent_2,i sid know that . i doubt it really had any effect on the other team thougn . what do you think about that .
9470,433,agent_1,"yeah it does no5 seem to have muhc effrct eithrr ; bowlers used to mak mor4e than football players in the 60s , wow"
9471,433,agent_2,yeah i would say that aversge playefs make a whole lot more today than the stars did back then . crazy how muchm oney is in football .
9472,433,agent_1,that is true and yet egnineers make more over their lifetime
9473,433,agent_2,i heard taht . did you know that espn actually won an emmy for the yellow line they superimpose on the screen to show the firsg down
9474,433,agent_1,"yeah that is strange but good fo rthem , i guess it helps a lot with qatching the gfame"
9475,433,agent_2,it coes give us fans a betyter perspective of how far they need to get for a first down . if you think about it . its pretty simple but genius .
9476,433,agent_1,yeah for sure . do you know what the highest score is in history of football ?
9477,433,agent_2,"yeoin1 916 georgia tech beat dumebrland 222 0. bet fgey didmt want to play them again for awhile , hubh ."
9478,433,agent_1,i bet so too . gyeorgia tech must be stilkl bragging to this day about that amazing win .
9479,433,agent_2,"everythingw ould have to go perfect every play to sore that ,any points . usually when a teamg ets upb y so m7ch they pet off a little bit . 6they s8re didnt on that day ."
9480,433,agent_1,yeah exactly . did you hear they are ising tracking chips on the platers nw ?
9481,433,agent_2,yeah they are in their sholder pars i bel8eve . they are also placed inside the footballs
9482,433,agent_1,"yeah , they are tracking velocity and rotation so i have they can use that sata to make the game safer too"
9483,433,agent_2,lts hope so . its cool all th einformation they can get these days .
9484,433,agent_1,i know so much out there . it was nice chatting with ypu .
9485,434,agent_1,hi ! ae yu a football fan ?
9486,434,agent_2,"hi ! yes i sm a footabll fan . i prefer the american football than 'fvootball' as some like to call in ogter countries when referring to soccer , do you ?"
9487,434,agent_1,"i woulf say i am more of a soccer fan , but i follow some football . have you heard of the tb12 method ?"
9488,434,agent_2,"i onlyk now that it i something to do with tom brady and that's what the ' tb ' stands for , but waht does the 12 stand foe ?"
9489,434,agent_1,12 is his number that ue wearsf or the patriots .
9490,434,agent_2,"oh ! taht makes total sense now ,w hat is ' the tb12 method ? '"
9491,434,agent_1,"it is almost like a religkon , especially to patriots fans . they see tom as some sort of messiah"
9492,434,agent_2,"i can imagine , there are lots of diehar dfans of his out hterer , maybe h egarnered even more of thoxe fans after the release of the documentary ' to mvs time ' , have you seen it ?"
9493,434,agent_1,"i have not , have you ?"
9494,434,agent_2,"no , i haven't because it premieresd on faceboo kwatch and i don't use that funct9on of the social media platform , do you ?"
9495,434,agent_1,"i do occasionally ,b ut usually if something strikes my interest while browsing ."
9496,434,agent_2,"would you be interested in watching that docuseries about him ? maybe they mention something about how the former patriots player , benjarvus greenellis neve rfumbled the fotball in his career , that's impressive ."
9497,434,agent_1,"that is really impressive . i hope they end up paying him well . not the same as bowlers , who made the saem amount as pro football player sein the 1960's"
9498,434,agent_2,"yeah and even engineers who nake more than foobtall playdrs , considering they only have eleven minutes of liveg ame play , maybe t's not such a bad thing they're paid less than engineers ."
9499,434,agent_1,"id love to only ' work ' 11 minutes a week and make mil,ions . ha . i realize that there is so much other styff that goes in to playing , but thzt is kinda crazy ."
9500,434,agent_2,me too ! i wonder if tha thigh salary and the way they enforce rules like making cheerleaders leave a rest6aurant if an nfl player walks in gets to their ego at all ?
9501,434,agent_1,it is probably ar ule because of their ego . i cant se eamy other logical reason for it .
9502,434,agent_2,but i think making them leav fuels their ego . i wonder if that rule has ben aemnded becuse i s4hds such a bad light on the team imo .
9503,434,agent_1,"i think it should be , besid4s the physical requi5ements , i cant see females wanting to play in the nfl if that is how they treat women ."
9504,434,agent_2,"i would think money has a big factor and maybe proving somehting , but i imagine they must medt at least the physical requirrmentz to withstand the impact of a 300 ound lineabxker , you think female nfl players gear would be any differnt ?"
9505,434,agent_1,"i dont know , personally id want a lot of bubble wrap ."
9506,434,agent_2,"lol , i think i'd want that and alwso a sumo suit with extra paddibng on top of tha t."
9507,435,agent_1,hey friend
9508,435,agent_2,"hello , are you a fan of the nfl ?"
9509,435,agent_1,"i love watching the nfl , it is my new religuon"

9515,435,agent_1,"i think there are 3 2to6al teams in the nfl , which is your favorite nfl team ?"
9516,435,agent_2,i am going to say the patriots . do you know their qb bejarvuws ?
9517,435,agent_1,"it was their running back , patriots are my favorite , tom rady is my savior ."
9518,435,agent_2,"nice , he is a great player for sure . ed you know tehy are uwing tracking chips on teh players now ?"
9519,435,agent_1,"i did not know that ,h ow does that wokr ?"
9520,435,agent_2,well tuey put them on their padding and then use them to tract velocity and rotation and a bunch of othe rstats
9521,435,agent_1,"that is crazy technology , probably developed by those ejngineers making mre money ."
9522,435,agent_2,mos6 likely . did you know espn won an emmy once ?
9523,435,agent_1,"i heard about that , for the yellow line on the tv right ? !"
9524,435,agent_2,y3ha i guess that deserves an award . did you know bowlers used tom ak more money than football players during hte 60s
9525,435,agent_1,"i never knew tha t, i bet it is much different now ! nice chatt9ng with you !"
9526,435,agent_2,yeah the footbal;l players for sure make more money now . nice cha ttoo .

9532,436,agent_2,my favorite team is the gr4een by packers ! rdo you have a favorite ?
9533,436,agent_1,i like the patriots and tom brady as a player .
9534,436,agent_2,i'm not a fan o ftom brady . . . he seems to cocky vor me . i also don't like him being compared to a messiah figure !
9535,436,agent_1,yeaht hat is too much i find . i guess he i salo a writer now
9536,436,agent_2,and apparently a little bit of an actor since he's in his own ' documentary ' ' tom vs time . '
9537,436,agent_1,yeha that i strue . did you know women can also ppay in the nfp ?
9538,436,agent_2,"i didn't . i know one or two play in college , but didn't think the nfl was that witb it . i would love to see one ! what do you think about the university o fiowa ahving a pink visiting team locker room ?"
9539,436,agent_1,i think it is meant to be some sort of a distraction for the oppposing team but now sure how well it works
9540,436,agent_2,how distracted do you think cumgerpand wzas in 1916 when heyl ost tog eorgia tech 2220 ?
9541,436,agent_1,"i bet a lot , taht is such a high school it is teh higheast in theh istory of the sport so far"
9542,436,agent_2,i would feel bad for cumberland if i was a georga tech player ! i wonder if brady would ever beat anyone that bad oe if his faith wouldn't allow him to ?
9543,436,agent_1,"yeah interesting point . on another topic , do you know much about the bibel ?"
9544,436,agent_2,i know a little bit about it . did you know jefferson created his own version of the bible ?
9545,436,agent_1,yes he used a razor to cut out the supenraturl oparts off o fit
9546,436,agent_2,that's a little differ4nt ! before 1963 kids in elementary school had to read from the bible . . . i bet kids in private schools still have to !
9547,436,agent_1,yeah especially in catholic schools . i am glad that rule does not apply anymore though . religion shojuld be a choice
9548,436,agent_2,i agree ! apparently so did roosevelt and adams since they didn't swear in to be president with a bible .
9549,436,agent_1,"yeah , they are thwe nly two . did yoy know people believe the tower of babel still exists ?"
9550,436,agent_2,that's awesome ! i heard it was in irwq ! nice chatting with you !
9551,437,agent_1,"hi , are you a fan of football ?"
9552,437,agent_2,yes i am . i usually watch nfl games on tv .
9553,437,agent_1,"i do sometimes a swell , but i cut cahle a long tim ago , so it i usually justf the superbowl ."
9554,437,agent_2,i read an article tha tnfl does not hae rules against female players . i was rathdr surprised .
9555,437,agent_1,"same her e, ive never seen a female on the field ."
9556,437,agent_2,"they allow female players but no one seems to be interested in joining . there ids one femle referee though , if i'm not mistaken ."
9557,437,agent_1,i think you are correct . i have heard something aboutt he femael referee . i hop ethey treat he rbetter than they treat cheerleaders .
9558,437,agent_2,"yes , i heard about fhe ne orleans cheerleaders . have you hear dabout the rule that they have to follow ?"
9559,437,agent_1,"yeah , they have to leave a retaurant if a player walks in , nad cant eat at htes amd place ."
9560,437,agent_2,why cannot they stay if tehy are at the restaurant first ? the players need to leave if they come when the cheerleaders are already there .
9561,437,agent_1,"apparently can't , im not sure whaf happened to necessitate that rule ."
9562,437,agent_2,the mjedia has never mentioned about it . i wonder why . they could influence the ne worleans team to chang this odd rule .
9563,437,agent_1,i don?t know if it is a league wide rule or just applicab.le to the saints . it is crazy though .
9564,437,agent_2,it certainly is . do you admire tom brady ?
9565,437,agent_1,i do think ehj is fantastic athlete . but i don;t buy into gis tb12 stuff .
9566,437,agent_2,ist his tb12 stuff mentioned in the facbeook watch program about him ?
9567,437,agent_1,i am not shre . i hacven't seen it . it might be something that i look up . it woudl probably be interesting .
9568,437,agent_2,perhaps i will watch that facebook watch program that was aired on jna 25 this year .
9569,437,agent_1,ill have to look it up . i heard tehre is a tom vs tim4e episoxe .
9570,437,agent_2,could yout ell me whwt it is about ?
9571,437,agent_1,"i havent seen it yet , i know he says he is giving up his life to play football ."
9572,437,agent_2,it sounds like football is his religion . i've got to run now . i enjoyed the hcat .
9573,438,agent_1,"hey , you ever read the bible ?"
9574,438,agent_2,"i have , not really a religious person but used to read the sacred book whe ni was a kid"
9575,438,agent_1,"it is the beast selling book of all time . i sometimes read it , however i am not as strictly disciplined lik students that were required to red it in school brfore !"
9576,438,agent_2,"it is ? i guess there are a oot okf religious person sout there , did you know fthomas jefferson created his own version of the bilbe"
9577,438,agent_1,"yeqah , that is impressive improvising !"
9578,438,agent_2,"it is , he took out th emiracles and resurrections from it i guess he doesnt believe in that part of th ebible"
9579,438,agent_1,it is reasonable to want to only see factual and real things int he bible . it is p4omising that at least the tower of babel is probably based on an actual building .
9580,438,agent_2,"i didnt know tja ! i liked to read that stiory when i was a child , thge tower of babel , great story"
9581,438,agent_1,yeah . it is interesting also hoa there is differing perspectives on hwat is canonical text in theb ible .
9582,438,agent_2,you know that the estimated sales of tehb ible are 5 billion copies worldwide ! ! !
9583,438,agent_1,"personally , i ca nonly imagine what it would be like to make a book htat is that successful ! !"
9584,438,agent_2,"im not ab ig fan of many part sof teh book , there are many thing sthat are wronga nd proven to be mistaken , science is a better way at times"
9585,438,agent_1,"perhaps wisdom can be derive dfrom the actions of thomas jefferson , who tqkes the saying of taking things with a grain of salt to a far loint ."
9586,438,agent_2,"thomas jefferson was a really wise man , taking the supernatural parts fromt he bible makes sense , the book itself has many valuabel lessons but i dont now about mi5racles"
9587,438,agent_1,"furthermor e, teddy roosevelt and john quoincy adams were nonconforming , choosing not to swear in with a bible ."
9588,438,agent_2,"i guess they are the only ones , most presieents are religious or appear to be because of the ublic , interesting ho wthe fruit apple got its name"
9589,438,agent_1,"yeah , after the bible was translated . tha twas a surprising facf to me ."
9590,438,agent_2,yeah and the meanign of both apple and evil and the whol emalus thing i guess thats why some evik characters have that name
9591,438,agent_1,"yeah , history is very complex . who would of thought that an apple was not just an apple ?"
9592,438,agent_2,"i agree for me it was just an apple no clje about the meaning behind the word , have you heard about thea pocrypha ?"
9593,438,agent_1,"yeah , there is much difference of opinion overf that ."
9594,438,agent_2,"yeah varios levels of respect and disagreemen tabojt it , well its a good thing reading the bible s not a mandatory thing in eleemntary education , we should all be free to chose our own religion"
9595,439,agent_1,do you enjoy sports ?
9596,439,agent_2,"i do . football is my favorite , but i like s4everal othrfs . i am not ,like tom brady htough who sees football as his religion according to one reporg ."
9597,439,agent_1,i do like the patriots
9598,439,agent_2,"except for a couple of cases of ch4ating , they are the class of the nfl this dentury . but gotham chopra has a tv deries about hpw tom brady is beating father time to keep playing longe r."
9599,439,agent_1,i would say they are like the lanisters of football
9600,439,agent_2,great analogy ! chopra mskes that point that it is much easier for strangers to talk about sports than about religion .
9601,439,agent_1,probably befause religion is such a very controversiazl or touchy topic
9602,439,agent_2,"no doubt . htey have so much confidence , faith , inh the coach that they have a saying , ' in bill se trust '"
9603,439,agent_1,i mean trusting the coach is essential so you dn't make a mistake whil ehesitating
9604,439,agent_2,"tha5t is certainly true for the players , but i think it carries over to the fans . why not ? he has won more playoff games than any coach in history ."
9605,439,agent_1,so do you have any favorite team or player ?
9606,439,agent_2,i am sn oklahoam univerzity fan . so i have enjoyed seeing baker mayfield do well in cleveland . cleveland is one of the 32 teams in the nfl .
9607,439,agent_1,how did they do in the last superbowl ?
9608,439,agent_2,"ha ha ! they were 016 last year so they were happy to win some retgular season gmes . they almost made the playoffs . there afre 6 of te 32 teams that make the playoffs . their other players are young and talented , so they may make it this season ."
9609,439,agent_1,that soundsg reat . they must have improved by leps adn bgounds
9610,439,agent_2,they realy did . have you seen the yellow line on tv that shows the line to gain for a first down ?
9611,439,agent_1,wasn't it done first by espn ?
9612,439,agent_2,"it was . it adds a lot to my viewing pleasure . espn received an emmy for it ,"
9613,439,agent_1,i mesn it does help the audience digest all the action much more easily
9614,439,agent_2,yes it does . the nfl also puts tracking chips in the footballs t0m easure velocity and rate of spin . i wonder if that data will be used to compare qbs .
9615,439,agent_1,i hope they use i6 to reduce injuries
9616,439,agent_2,me tpoo . they have them in the pads and that could help on injuries . nic catting withj you .
9617,440,agent_1,"hi , do you watch the fnl ?"
9618,440,agent_2,i enjoy watchin gnfl quarterback tom brady .
9619,440,agent_1,"nice , he is a gopod player . di dyou know he is also a book writer now ?"
9620,440,agent_2,is taht part of his tb12 method i've hear dso mucha bout
9621,440,agent_1,yeah it is that oine . did you knoww omen can play in the nfl ?
9622,440,agent_2,"that is impressive , coxnidering the new orleans saints rules on women vheerleaders and players ."
9623,440,agent_1,yeah that is prretty sexist that tehy cannot eat in the same restaurant
9624,440,agent_2,what do you think that hte average nfl game only has eleven minutes of action ?
9625,440,agent_1,"that is pretty crazy to be hohnest , prettys hort . did you won espn wo nan emmy once ?"
9626,440,agent_2,"yes , i heard about that . the yellow lune was a big hcange for broadcast fgootball ."
9627,440,agent_1,"yes it sure is , makes it easier for us ath ome when we are watching the gmae"
9628,440,agent_2,i wonder if they would've been able to keep up if tje technolog7y existed in 1916 for the highest scoring football game .
9629,440,agent_1,yeah that was quite something 2220 georgia ech must have been doing something right
9630,440,agent_2,i wonder if they culd've accomplished that with pin klocker rooms like at the university of iowa .
9631,440,agent_1,"hmm maybe , that could be it . did you know bowlers used to make more htan football players in the 60s ?"
9632,440,agent_2,"even today , an engineer w8ill earn more lifetime than many professional atheletes ."
9633,440,agent_1,yeah i guess tje fact that tjei rcareers t4nd to be short they cannot make too much money
9634,440,agent_2,"combining the two topics , then fl is considering hirng enbgineers for chips to embed in equipment ."
9635,440,agent_1,yeqh ig seems theu can no wtrack velocity and rotatio nand such . hope they can use that to make the game safer too .
9636,440,agent_2,too true . i wonder what thomas jefferson jight have tuought about such things ! he disliked what he called ' supernatural ' .
9637,440,agent_1,yeah he certainly did not believe in resurrection and miracles so cut them out with a dazor
9638,440,agent_2,resally ? whsat did he cut them out of ?
9639,440,agent_1,the actual bible and that way he had a version of it withou ttyhose partds .
9640,440,agent_2,interesting . i wonder if h got sworn in wiht that bible . teddy roosevelt and john quincy adams are the only presidents that did not use a bible .
9641,440,agent_1,"yeah , i have a feeling he used that one ."
9642,441,agent_1,"hi there , do you watch the nfl much ?"
9643,441,agent_2,i cant sayt hat i do . i usually wathc aroubnd plasyoff times . tom brady sure does seem to be dominant .
9644,441,agent_1,"yeah h eis for sure , he id one of the best players right now . and now he is hte author of a book too"
9645,441,agent_2,"yeah , which has also come to ber know as the athlete's bible"
9646,441,agent_1,"yeah , which has lso come to be know as hte athelete's bible"
9647,441,agent_2,"peopls who are fans of the patriots see him as some sort of ,essiah ."
9648,441,agent_1,"yeah for ure . gtere was another qbt here , benajrvus have you heard of him ?;"
9649,441,agent_2,"yeah , wasn't he the fuy who didn't ever fumble theb all ? thats a pretty incredible feat ."
9650,441,agent_1,"that sure is , what a career . did you know bowletrs used to make more than football players in the 60s"
9651,441,agent_2,"that is surprising , i never sae bowling az htat popular . but engineers make more over a lifetime than football players . so there is some incentive to work hard in school ."
9652,441,agent_1,yup sure it and they deserve it . i guess their careers are longer too so they have mo9re tim eto maek money
9653,441,agent_2,"very true , even though tom brady is 40 , mos tstarse dont last thyat long . foobtall can be hard on hte body ."
9654,441,agent_1,yeah it sure can be . did you kno espn won an emmy once ?
9655,441,agent_2,yeah . wasnt it for the yellow line ? that is a pretty neat invention . makes viewing at home a lot easier .
9656,441,agent_1,"yeah it was , it sure helps a lot for us . edo you know what the hifghest score in a game has been so far ?"
9657,441,agent_2,it was betwee nga tech and cumberland wasn't it lik e2220
9658,441,agent_1,"yes it was , what a game . on another topi cd, do you know much about hte bible ?"
9659,441,agent_2,"i do jnow some . on eof th emost interesting facxts i know is that the word zpple comes from the latin amlus , which also means evil ."
9660,441,agent_1,that is quite interesting . did you know that jefferson created his own version of the bibl e?
9661,441,agent_2,"yeah , using ar azor . tha5ts kind of crazy ."
9662,441,agent_1,yeah and he cut out all the supernatural part off of it i guess he ws not much of a believer
9663,441,agent_2,definitely one who picked the parts that eh wanted to believe .
9664,441,agent_1,yup seems that way . it was nice chatting with you .
9665,442,agent_1,"hey m, do you consider yoursefl religious ? the bible is the bsst selling biok !"
9666,442,agent_2,"i bet it has sold a ton of copies . did you know that before 1963 , it was not uncommon for kaerican students fo be required to read from the bible as a4t of their eleemntary education ?"
9667,442,agent_1,yeah . i am nowhere near that level of discipline . times were so different before !
9668,442,agent_2,"would you create your own version f the bible ? thomas jefferson created his own cersion of the bible , cutting out the 'supernatural' parts , such as the miracles and the resrrection ."
9669,442,agent_1,"if someone as well kjowna nd respect as thomas jefferson did hat to the bible , then i think the bibel should really be taken with a grain of salt . furthermore , there is muhc dispute about the bibl ."
9670,442,agent_2,"the language certainly has changed over time . for eample , an apple only became known as an ' pple ' when the bible was tr4anslated into latin in ghe 4th century . the reason : 5he word ' malus ' means both apple and evil . that is an interestin gcoincidence ."
9671,442,agent_1,"for sure . there ie not a consensus about what is vanonical in eh bible . i would like to study the bible deeply somedd ay , and interpret what i think i scanonicap ."
9672,442,agent_2,"itf probably has value as a historical document .t he biblica ltower of babel was li,ely based on a real buildkng , the etemennaki in iraq . i wonder what it looks like ."
9673,442,agent_1,"that is a relief , i suppose , that at least some parts of the nible can ve traced back to reality , and are not all supernatural ."
9674,442,agent_2,"some people think it has no place in government . for example , president steddy roosevelt and john quincy adams did not use a bible at theur ssearingin ceremonies . i think they swore on the constitution ."
9675,442,agent_1,"yeah , and they were the only two u . s . presidents to do that !"
9676,442,agent_2,i guess they did not see a need to follow tradition . they felt that they owed allegiance to hte people and the government first .
9677,442,agent_1,in my opinion that is hnorable . the bible is not even completely agreed on . the american peopke should not be infuse with such dubiousness .
9678,442,agent_2,you'e right . among christian deominationst herd is some disagreement about what should be included in the canon . it' sunckear what accepted .
9679,442,agent_1,yeah . there is disagreementa bout the apoc4ypha . the apocrypha is even regarded with varying levels of respect .
9680,442,agent_2,i think there are usefl ideas from th epast that have been discarded for political reasons .
9681,442,agent_1,"hopefully brave men in politics , like thomas jefferson , will use ingen7ity and dissen tto save us and opne our eyes ."
9682,442,agent_2,"it would be good for people to consider a rnge of ideas , whetjer about the bible or politics . the times cuagne and our perspective must change as wdell ."
9683,442,agent_1,"yeah . vonsidering there is s much disavredement about the bible , we may reahc a conclusion in the future about its meaning thqt is surprising . as surrising that apple only came to be known as apple after the bi9ble was translated into latin !"
9684,442,agent_2,"translation is tough , but reveals that language has historical meanjng . disagreement will never end , so plursuit of knowledge shouldn't either . thanks for the chat !"
9685,442,agent_1,"yeah , thank you rtoo ! have a great day !"
9686,442,agent_2,thanks !
9687,442,agent_1,bye .
9688,443,agent_1,hello my friend ! do youl ike football and avocado ice cream ?
9689,443,agent_2,football is tne best sport in the world . everyone plays ! the world cup is a special time around the gloeb .
9690,443,agent_1,it truly is 21 and its come a pong way ! in the 160's top bowelrs amde twice as much as top football stas
9691,443,agent_2,hte bowlers knew the score . football was not the game back then . everyone loved bowling . it's about timing l historical timing .
9692,443,agent_1,"you are rigth ands ay its o beautifully . since football is a family of team sports there are so many different variations of footbaslls htat are known as football codes such as gaelic football , rgby , soccer etc"
9693,443,agent_2,"the game of ball played wit the foot . there are many forms , as many forms as there are peoples on this vast planet ."
9694,443,agent_1,"yes ! too bad i neverg ot into sports ! i wish i would have . i prefer to read or paint , more in the art area . . . yes nerdy haha did you know that prior to 1963 it was not unommon for kids in the us to read the bible as part of school . thats awesome !"
9695,443,agent_2,"i guess that would work . children ho7ld now about the world around them , and the world after ."
9696,443,agent_1,"completley agree , couldn't have said it better"
9697,443,agent_2,"i thik that the children lookt o teacehrs gor knowledge , not just information ,n ot just data , not just facts , but truth ."
9698,443,agent_1,"ys , i'm still looking for truth . it seems like everyone is oj some eort of spiritual quest at the same time , its quite beautiful . i can feel i t. even brady ! he has a best selling book and is on a siritual mission ,e ven all the materil in the world cant keep usb lindfolded and distracted . there is a whole other world or s out there ."
9699,443,agent_2,"i hope that the brady trsct ca nspeed people on their journey to that truth . all seek , few find . brady might b4 one of them ."
9700,443,agent_1,"yes , im going to look into that but i bet he is as many wil,l be . we hea rabout it in the bible . whihc did you know the bible is the best seller in thew orld , as it should be , in a total of 5 billion copie !"
9701,443,agent_2,that is many copies . i guess that it makes sense that there is demand for books that hlep us toward the light .
9702,443,agent_1,"yes , its all around us i feel like . life almost feels like ' once upon a time ' have you seent hat series ? like people living under a spell i cant explain it , but like a veil of sorts , fant explain it but its facinating theo4y . loike did you kno2 that apple only became known as spple hwen teh bible was tranmsl,ated into latin in the 4th century"
9703,443,agent_2,the apples is the start of our tragic existence . we must deal with our state of culpitude because of the apple .
9704,443,agent_1,"indeed , i wonder why teddy rkosevelt and john quincy adams were the only two prsidents thaf did not use z bible at their swearing in ceremonies ."
9705,443,agent_2,they did not want to swear allsgiance to a d3ity . they wanted to swear allegiance to the constituion .
9706,443,agent_1,that makes sense and an interestign way to see it . . . izs that what the other presidents do or what the bible is for ? im truly7 curious .
9707,443,agent_2,i do0 not think so . it id tradition to use a bible . i expect that it is unusua lto not use one .
9708,443,agent_1,"by the way , in latin the word apple ah evil are the same thinb ! that's pretty interesting and i get it now !"
9709,443,agent_2,"yes , true . apples are good for health , bad for fai6h . thank you for your chatting . have a good night ."
9710,443,agent_1,haha thank you too ! it was fun . good nigh5 ! namaste
9711,444,agent_1,"how's it going , have you heard about the tb12 method ?"
9712,444,agent_2,"hi , no what is the tb12 method ."
9713,444,agent_1,it's a book written by nfl bq that's about hisz frainijg methods and diet
9714,444,agent_2,is that the book written by tom brady ?
9715,444,agent_1,yes and h ecredits it with him still able to play foobtall at 40
9716,444,agent_2,it migth be worth rwading because you cerainly can't argue with succdss . are you a tom brady fan ?
9717,444,agent_1,"nop not really , i'm definitelyn ot ad evoted boston fan"
9718,444,agent_2,do you have a favorite team ?
9719,444,agent_1,out of the 32 teams in the nfl my favorite is the giatns . you ?
9720,444,agent_2,my sentimental favorite has always bedn the rams because i grew up in southern cal . needless to say i was disappointed with the last super bowl .
9721,444,agent_1,"ywa that was a rough game , at least it wasn't as abda s georgia tech beatint cumberlan 220"
9722,444,agent_2,i can't eve imagine what it must have felt like to lose thatb adly . i think the gme should have been stopped .
9723,444,agent_1,"yea that is a pretty appalling performance by cumberland , there hasn't been aw orse performabce in over a 100 years"
9724,444,agent_2,that's an interesting fact . what do you think aout the team that painted the opposing teams locker rkom pink ?
9725,444,agent_1,i find it pretty funny the university of iowa would go as far as paintingt he visiting locker room pink
9726,444,agent_2,"yeah . bit , if i was on th ohter team iw ould probably wantt o get back at them ."
9727,444,agent_1,that sounds much worse than pink lockeer rooms
9728,444,agent_2,you know the saying he who laughs last laughs best .
9729,444,agent_1,well i guess engineers laugh last since they make more in their lifetime than the averag nf lplayer
9730,444,agent_2,tyat's a pretyty amazing stat . but ic an understand it gecause football player don't usually have long careers because of injuries .
9731,444,agent_1,"well i got to go , nice talkign with you"
9732,445,agent_1,"hello there , do you watch the nfl ?"
9733,445,agent_2,i am really not ytat into football but i do follow it some . i heard soemthing funny one time . that the university of iowa's visiting locker room is painted completely pink
9734,445,agent_1,yeah i wonder waht the reasoning behind tha twas . did you know women can play too ?
9735,445,agent_2,wow i didn't know that . is aw that an average nfl game has only 11 minutes of actual play time
9736,445,agent_1,"yeah that is pretty short , crazy . do you kno wwhat the highest score in a game was ?"
9737,445,agent_2,no i am not sure . i read that the averhe lifetime searnings of an egnineer i more than nlf player
9738,445,agent_1,yeah i guess that makes sense since engineers work longer . the game scores was 2220
9739,445,agent_2,wow that is crazy . did you know tht the nfl us3s tracking devices in players shoulder pads to track tehir movements
9740,445,agent_1,yeah that i spretty cool . they are tracking velocity and rotation and all that fun stuff
9741,445,agent_2,yeah thag is pretty interesting how they d that . on a different note . i found this that in 1963 it was not uncommon for students in the us to be required to ead the bible as part of their education
9742,445,agent_1,wow di notk now that i am lgad we have joved on froj that . and jerferson made hi sown version of the bible . wow
9743,445,agent_2,i heard that teddy roosevelt and john quincy adams are the onlyt wo presidents that did not use the bible at their swearing in ceremonies
9744,445,agent_1,i guess they were not religious . wondr if jefferson swore on his own bible version without lal the supernatural stuff in it
9745,445,agent_2,"yeah , that would eb interesimng to know . they said an appl onlyt becam eknown as that whe nthe bible was translated into lati8n"
9746,445,agent_1,yes because the word malus measn apple and also evil .
9747,445,agent_2,they say that the biblival tower of babel is likely absed off of thre etemenanki in modern day iraq . i believe however that th4 towrr of babel was destroyed so i'm not sure how that could be
9748,445,agent_1,i do not know much baout it but if it still exists in iraq that would be pretty cool . do you know how amny copies has the bible sold ?
9749,445,agent_2,how many ? i do know that is considered to be the most influential and best selling book .
9750,445,agent_1,yeah it is and i believe s4elling 5 billion copies grants you that title
9751,445,agent_2,did you noq that the bible is translated from greek as ' the bopoks '
9752,445,agent_1,oh that is pretty cool . i guess it makes sense in the brpad ter .
9753,446,agent_1,"hell0 there , do you watch the nfl ?"
9754,446,agent_2,the mfl ? th national football league ? i thought that hadb een outlawed . is i tstill inb usoness ?
9755,446,agent_1,yeah the nfl is a really big deal in the us . do you know how many teams are there now ?
9756,446,agent_2,how many teams are there ? does each state have a team ?
9757,446,agent_1,"there are cudrently 32 teams and the game season is about 17 weeks , so lots of games there"
9758,446,agent_2,17 weeks seems short . yhat's not much a work year . and al ot of vacation ! great job ! iw ihe i yad one .
9759,446,agent_1,yeah that is a good point . i 3wonder why u of iowa has a pink locker room for visitors
9760,446,agent_2,that is probably because they want to raise awareness of breast cancer . al ot of football players get breastc ancer .
9761,446,agent_1,"maygbe , k do not know tjhe reason behind it . bowlers seems made more money in the 60s tban the football players"
9762,446,agent_2,bowlers probably were tnhe ieal athletes abck in the day and got respect fod it .t hey never painted the lanes or the ball pink . little breastc ancer awareness .
9763,446,agent_1,"yeah i guess , but even nowadays engineers ovber their lifetime mke more money than footblal players"
9764,446,agent_2,we need more ' pink ' engineers too . that is a better prifession for breast cancer awareness .
9765,446,agent_1,yeah i guesss o . did you know women can play in the nfl ?
9766,446,agent_2,that would be a good way to raise breast cancer awasreness . they coulxd wear pink uniforms and st8ff .
9767,446,agent_1,yeah that could be one wzy . now they are also using tracking chips on the players during the gmaes
9768,446,agent_2,i think that;s a great to track whihc platers are at risk for breast cajcer .
9769,446,agent_1,"they actually check for velocity , rotation and such . i hope they can make the game safer too"
9770,446,agent_2,"cnacer is easier to treat if it is caught earlier . football really is on hte front lines , i can see ."
9771,446,agent_1,"yeah it sure is . on another topic , do you know much about the ible ?"
9772,446,agent_2,"i have 4eqd it seceral times . not much of a plot , but some interesting characters in the middle ."
9773,446,agent_1,yeah it seem that there is defintely a lot of history in tehre too .
9774,447,agent_1,hi do you like to watch footall ?
9775,447,agent_2,i do but i don't get the chance as much qnymore . the patriots are on a role .
9776,447,agent_1,do you know ow many teams are on the nfl ?
9777,447,agent_2,"wow thatw a good question , how many ?"
9778,447,agent_1,"32 . di you know that the former running back , benjaris greenellis has never fumbled the footbhall in his whoke nlf career ?"
9779,447,agent_2,i did know that how idonic that he a former patriot . they have good stock it would appear .
9780,447,agent_1,yes it's pretty vool . it's interesting how ' football ' means a diffeent kind of sport in other countrises .
9781,447,agent_2,"i know , honestly if ot's a sporr played with reet nad a ball then i guess tehy have the rihgt to call it that ."
9782,447,agent_1,that is true . in hungary ' footbaqll ' is soccer .
9783,447,agent_2,in parts o africa too . in australia rugby is football .
9784,447,agent_1,how many weeks are in the nfl's regular seson ?
9785,447,agent_2,17 weeks if im not mistaken . then the playoffs
9786,447,agent_1,yes you ar3 right . do youj know the highes tcore ever in a football game ?
9787,447,agent_2,ww not sure i wouild imagine it's pretty high . was it a college or professional fzme ?
9788,447,agent_1,2229 . it happened in 1916 when georgia tech defeated cumberland .
9789,447,agent_2,wow i 2ould have hated to be on the bus ride home . did you know thate spn won an award ?
9790,447,agent_1,yes that's an extremely high scoring game . no i did not know thwt ! did you know that in the 1960' top bowlers made twice as much as topf ootball stars ?
9791,447,agent_2,yeah i believe it wast wice as much . espn won an emmy for the superimposed line for the first downs .
9792,447,agent_1,did you know taht an average lifetime earning of an engineer is nhigher than the average lpifetime earning of wn hfl player andca n average mbl player ?
9793,447,agent_2,yeah but i still would rather do 10 and out wiht mi;lions than 40 and lout with the same .
9794,447,agent_1,true !
9795,448,agent_1,"yi , do you like football ?"
9796,448,agent_2,"hello , i love the nfl now thats a real sports league !"
9797,448,agent_1,eo you know if thwy have female players ?
9798,448,agent_2,"well , jot in the nf lthey dont but i', sure they might have a womans elague"
9799,448,agent_1,did you know that the nrfl has no rules against womne ? htey could elgally play if tehy met the requirements . what do you think ?
9800,448,agent_2,that would b egreat but no woman has tried yet
9801,448,agent_1,"i knoaw right , but tuey only acually play 11 minutes in an actual game . that sounds a bit short !"
9802,448,agent_2,"yeah because of the breaks , half times and timeout and calls tha tthe refs make ."
9803,448,agent_1,i wonder how much money a playerm akes . do you know ?
9804,448,agent_2,it all depends on the contract that they negociate but it is usualy int he milliopns !
9805,448,agent_1,slometimes they play concerts at halftime shows . do you lie the super bowl halftime shows ?
9806,448,agent_2,"no , i usually chanye the chanel during the half tim ehows haha"
9807,448,agent_1,do you like music and concerts though ?
9808,448,agent_2,"yeah , of course but only if i am af the live cocne5t not watching it on tv"
9809,448,agent_1,"can you believe that the ramones hav3 played over 2 , 000 concerts in 20 y3ars ?"
9810,448,agent_2,i believe it ! especially since linkin pakr played 324 in 2001 alone . add that by 20 years !
9811,448,agent_1,a cre4d concert wa sso bad that some goer sfiled a lawsuit zgainst them ! tat sounds funny .
9812,448,agent_2,that's pretty pathetic if you ask me just get your money back and go home haha
9813,448,agent_1,"yup , that is why i do not go to these events ."
9814,448,agent_2,well l obviously everyone else at the concert seemed to enjoy its l nkt to bqd of a deal
9815,448,agent_1,are there any concerts coming up that soud fun ?
9816,448,agent_2,"i haven't checked recently . hey , i gotta go for hnow it was nice chatting with you . i hope youh ave a grea tnight ."
9817,448,agent_1,"tahnk you , good night !"
9818,448,agent_2,good nigt
9819,449,agent_1,do you fllow the nfl ?
9820,449,agent_2,sodt of . i'm not an avid fan but i know the basics of it . how about you ?
9821,449,agent_1,"i am a fan , not a diehard fan but i do follow the important games , do you have a favorite tea m?"
9822,449,agent_2,i would say the packers . you have to respect a tema that can play outroors in that kind of weather .
9823,449,agent_1,"yeha they sure have a good teama nd get to play in harsh conditions , you know a game has about 11 minutes of gameplay , i guess ads take over the screen ."
9824,449,agent_2,yeah beteween the ads and teh shows during halftime and the commentators it i smore entertainment or xoncert than anything .
9825,449,agent_1,"i agree , thats why i prefer concerts like the one linkin park gave in 2001 , whqt a great concert"
9826,449,agent_2,linkin park is an amaign band . there isn't a ton of synthesized music there so what you hear on the radio i what you get in concert .
9827,449,agent_1,"i agree and their first albuk qas jjust great , they gave 324 concerts back in 2001 , im lucky that i went to one of them"
9828,449,agent_2,that isa n insane tour schedule . i wonder if it was all big venues or if it az some smaller ones . that has to take a toll on a person after a while .
9829,449,agent_1,"thats about 30 concerts a month , like a cocnert for day if you takeh olidays out of the equation , i bet it ws really harsh but made them a lot of money ."
9830,449,agent_2,that's true . i w9nder if that is the reason so many bands break up . that much time together is such a tiny space as a tour bus has to get one people's nerves
9831,449,agent_1,"yeah i know i would become crazy after a few weeks or months , maybe tjat's what happened with creed , i went to on of hteir concerts an di di dnot enjoy it"
9832,449,agent_2,i heard that people were suing them because of all the thjings that wen wrong .l how bad does a concert have to be for you to sue thd band ?
9833,449,agent_1,"i know right ? and i get them , i wantsd to sue the band as well because the concer5t didnt meet my expecxtations at al l."
9834,449,agent_2,they should trake a page out of pink floyd's book and just recor a live concert with no audience and then makd th evideo availabel .
9835,449,agent_1,"i think thats a great idea , audience can ge dist74rbing so that might helo them although i think the band isn't together anymore"
9836,449,agent_2,lawsuits probably had something to do with that . hard to keep a abnd together when the money ins't there and the band usn't performing wella t al l.
9837,449,agent_1,"i agree , so do you follow politics ?"
9838,449,agent_2,i really do . i think in this day and age with all the controversy it is important to stay informed . what about you ?
9839,449,agent_1,"i do lkike 6o follow politics , irs important to know wats happening in th ecountry , thue decisiohns that are being made ."
9840,450,agent_1,whata re your thought aon the colin kaepernick's dismissal of his complaint ?
9841,450,agent_2,"i'm no tsure , oi don't follow it that closely . anytime there is an arbitrator it generally isn't favorable to the nonbusines ssife ."
9842,450,agent_1,very rtrue ! i support colin's cause .
9843,450,agent_2,"interesting , i cdould care less what he is doing tp be honest . i don't follow footabll ."
9844,450,agent_1,her has a very good attorney in amtk geragos .
9845,450,agent_2,i've neve rheard of him . did you knoe the nfl uses tracking chips in players shoulder pads to record their moves ? seemsc raz
9846,450,agent_1,how hitech of them ! i wonder if all 33 teams use that technology .
9847,450,agent_2,i'm fairly certain they do . seems like an immense amount of money to pay fhough . k wonder who provides the technology ?
9848,450,agent_1,gret question . if wome nplayed i would like to see the differences in hteir results . women can play if they meete ligibility requirements .
9849,450,agent_2,there were women players when iwas in high sch9ol . apparently the foo fighters played a concert so loud it showed up on new zealand's seismic monitors .
9850,450,agent_1,i love the foo fighters almost as much as i love linkin park . i saw one of their 324 concert in 2001 ?
9851,450,agent_2,"they are pretty good , have you evers een the, live ?"
9852,450,agent_1,i have ! they are much better than creed . fans filed lawsuits in 2002 againstc reed for a bad concert .
9853,450,agent_2,"really ? that is sort of surprising . i've never seen reed , but there music does not seem all that co,plex to play ."
9854,450,agent_1,"i was surpriseda bout that too . singers make a lo tof money , but not as much as presidents . jkf , washington , and jefferson were quite wealthy ."
9855,450,agent_2,well i n192 deep purple rbok the world rwcord for loudest concert ever . apparently some of the audience wasr endered unconscious .
9856,450,agent_1,i can't even imagine how scary that must have been !
9857,450,agent_2,i wonder if it is due to the fact that they blew ther ears out ?
9858,450,agent_1,concerts are live so you never know what to expewct !
9859,450,agent_2,exactly ! i've been to a bunch . did 7ou know linco.n was the first plresidenyt o be photographed for his inauguration ?
9860,450,agent_1,pretty cool for the 16th president ! i hope he got t0 live in the wgitr h9use guest house which is larger tgan the white house !
9861,451,agent_1,hi how are you ? what do you think oft he presikdecny ?
9862,451,agent_2,i think it's accumulated way too much power and should be stripprd of most o fthem espedially the war powers and antional emergency poaers . how about you ?
9863,451,agent_1,i think that the presidecny is as good as the person holding it . a good presidency makes good use of tye powers . a bad on eabuses them .
9864,451,agent_2,"i don't htink we should trust a good presidet with powers we wouldn't be willing to let a bad one have , because these powers always seem to ratchet upwards and nmever get decreased again ."
9865,451,agent_1,"yeah , once hte pfecedent is established , it is hard to go back . i am worried that the damage could be long lasting ."
9866,451,agent_2,"tje lqst time presidnetial powers ere reined in at all was after wagergate . we needed another process afger the post911 power grab imo , bt instead of reverzing all thse grant so fpower under obamz he kept accumulatfing power . and look who has it now ."
9867,451,agent_1,"yeaj , then ext one will ave these nad more . i worry about war going on in other countries . we dont hear much , but there is a lot going on ."
9868,451,agent_2,"yeah , the lresident's power 6o start w3ars is reallt scary . and thre should eb safeguards n the nuclear football too imo ."
9869,451,agent_1,"yeah , htat would ve bad if things got nuclear . that threat still exists ."
9870,451,agent_2,"i was really scared of what might happen back during the war of words between trump and kim jongun , when trump was threatening ' fire and fury . '"
9871,451,agent_1,"yeah , it is hard to reverse that kind ofd isaster . trsdew ars can be handled , but real wars . . . a different story ."
9872,451,agent_2,i was afraid that he'd take advantage of war to delcare martial law or somethings o he wouldn't have to worry about being reelected . plus all those cities bu4ning in apan and korea would probably trigger a mini nuclear winter .
9873,451,agent_1,"yes , it is hard to kno wwhat the limits of presidential powers ae unti ltehy are tested . nad congress refuses to im0peach trump , n9 matter what . why ?"
9874,451,agent_2,"i think the democrats are afraid that if they tried and failed , they'd wind up losing seats in th enext election . tryin gand failing to remove clinton hurt the republicans politically ."
9875,451,agent_1,"ok ,t hat makes sense . i was bothered by the impeachment of clinton because i just dikdnt care that he had a istress . too many serious problems in wodld to care about that ."
9876,451,agent_2,that seems pretty tame compared to trump's history of corruptionq n dfraud and perjury .
9877,451,agent_1,"ues , those are serious crimes , and the involvemne twith russia really bothe4s me . the cold war s not over ."
9878,451,agent_2,and he's pusnhing for a rightwing coup in venezuela .
9879,451,agent_1,"he wanted to infade . what ? why ? that is crazy . it ish ard to invade a country . they need help , but an invasion ? anyway , great chat !"
9880,451,agent_2,i thimo there's another round to go .
9881,451,agent_1,"yeah , i usually start ont urn 9 . then we wrap up on 10 . the server has been acting up , so i like t9 get in and get out . too risky otherwise ;. have a good night !"
9882,451,agent_2,you too !
9883,452,agent_1,hi do you know much about the presidents ?
9884,452,agent_2,yes i know some suff . do you know who the wsealthiest us presidents re ?
9885,452,agent_1,"yes that would be jfk , wasgington nad jefferson"
9886,452,agent_2,right . did you know the guest house is larger than te white house
9887,452,agent_1,yrah that is pretty cool l they mustg et a lot of people there so maybe that is why
9888,452,agent_2,yeah . have you heard the president of indonesia is a pop srar ?
9889,452,agent_1,"yeah the guy has larady releasex 3 albums , wow"
9890,452,agent_2,right ? do you know how the vp used to be elected ?
9891,452,agent_1,"yes the runner up moved into the position of the vp , pretty nice"
9892,452,agent_2,yeha i think that is adctually fair because they work a lot towars that as well
9893,452,agent_1,exactly . do you watch tv at all ?
9894,452,agent_2,i sure do . di dyou ever wagch thes simpsons ?
9895,452,agent_1,ye si loce that show . did you know bart did not appear in an episode
9896,452,agent_2,yeah and tge weird part is that he was noft even mentioned in it
9897,452,agent_1,yeah pretty efrang4 . did you ever watch that 70s show ?
9898,452,agent_2,i did and i liked it but i guess it did not really take of in the uk as it got cancelled afte r01 epusodes
9899,452,agent_1,yeah but they remade it verbatim so that i guess explains it
9900,452,agent_2,"true , how about pokemon ?"
9901,452,agent_1,i hav3 seen some episodes but not al the 750 of tjhem
9902,452,agent_2,"yeah they have been in the air for about 16 years , so long"

9912,453,agent_1,au . did you know that trump is now the wealthiest president of the united states ?
9913,453,agent_2,"he is ? wow , i thought it was likej fk . . . good to know !"
9914,453,agent_1,"yeah , it was him but his wealth is tiny compared to trump's 2 . 2 billion dolalr networth !"
9915,453,agent_2,wow . that's surprising . it's also surpising knowingt hat there was a president called president banana .
9916,453,agent_1,wasn't h ethe very first president of zimbabee ? that ie a very odd nickname f9r you president !
9917,453,agent_2,yes and yes ! although i could really see 0president carrot catching on . . .
9918,453,agent_1,"haha , the president of indonesia has released a total of 3 pop albums while i nofficw ."

9932,454,agent_1,no i didn't kno wyhat ! doesn't seem like that makes any sens3e to me haha . did you know that ur rules for electionse changed in 1806 ?
9933,454,agent_2,i agree . mo i did not . how did they change ?
9934,454,agent_1,originally the runnerup would become vice president . so in our last election we would had vice president hillary cliton and president trump . talk about a lt of drama hahaz
9935,454,agent_2,wow ! that would have been crazy . we are much too partisan for that now . maybe it would force us to sork together more . off topic but do you watch al ot of tv ?
9936,454,agent_1,"i watch a litle bit of tv . since i don't have cabl ei only watch netflix mostly . i like the show stranger things , what about you ?"
9937,454,agent_2,i love stranger things . i watch a lot of tv . did you know that when south park aired their fajily guy epis9de the simpsons crew sentt hem flowers ?
9938,454,agent_1,haha i dids ee tht episode . it was really funny . yes i caj't wait for then ew season of stranger things . you know who i miss is eorge caflin . h ewas taken too early fro us
9939,454,agent_2,it was an amazing episode . i miss him too . did you know that he did narration for thomas the tank engine . they have had a lot of famous nartrators .
9940,454,agent_1,"i think i ehard aboutt aht . ringo starr , george carlin , alec baldwin , wht other show could have said that they hav so many great celebrities doing voces haha"
9941,454,agent_2,i'mq uite surprised that theyg ot such big names . are you a fan of thes impsons ?
9942,454,agent_1,i do like the simpdsons a lot . there's apparently onee pisode where bart does not appeqr and they never tlak about him haha . i need to chseck that out . do you know which episode that is ?
9943,454,agent_2,i do not . i'm surprised that there is only one since it has been on as long as it has .
9944,454,agent_1,"yes i'm surprised as well . i wonder if there are oher episodes that are midsing other characters entirely , liek homer for instance . i haven't heard of them doing that though"
9945,454,agent_2,i woudl be curious to find that ot as well . have you ever watched the pokemon cartoon ?
9946,454,agent_1,i have seen tha tshow . i used to love it as a kid . my favorite pokemon is piakchu ! what about you ? they also have about 750 epiesodes a tthis point don't they ?
9947,455,agent_1,hi ! do you watch much tv ?
9948,455,agent_2,hi ! i do wsatch a lot of t . i also enjoy the internet as well and agree benefits of the internet are pffset bt it's alrgest drawback which is the acceptance4 f anonymity . what about you ?
9949,455,agent_1,"i don twatcnh as much tv , but i would say i do have a mild addiction to the internet . i think anonymity is dahgerous because peopled isassociate the fact that there i sa real person in all of it and we corgeth ow to tdeat people"
9950,455,agent_2,"agresed . and htere are consequdnces , especially for celebrities like roseanne . had she sent taht tweet out azbout valerie jarrett under am anonymous accont , she would have never bene firedf rom roseanne ."
9951,455,agent_1,"very true , but some people like trump tweet all thet ime , as themselves , and no rrcourse is takehn . well except for more internet 0utrage ."
9952,455,agent_2,"that is true . i suppose public officials lile politicians can pretty much get away with almost whatever they want . speaking of politicians , i still can't believe only one president has ever held a phd and that was woodrow wilson !"
9953,455,agent_1,that is kihd of surprising . i would have though more had that distinction . but i really wasnt' even aware he had one .
9954,455,agent_2,agreed . and it's almost as surprising as knowign the last presiden to speak a foreign language was fdr . it's like what ios wrong witn the candidates who run thes edays ? ha !
9955,455,agent_1,"besides everything ? i heard nevada had an option on their ballot for neither of these cjdidates . wouldnt that be great ? i fwe dont like the selections , we can just votde to ghave a new group to vote for ."
9956,455,agent_2,greed . especially after knowing 5 presidents have been electe ddexspite losing the popualr vote . one even losing the popular vore by 10 plercent . that is sad !
9957,455,agent_1,tha isd really crazt . i wonder what other countries electio nprocedures are like ?
9958,455,agent_2,good point . i wonder thatr myself ! maybe i can fimd out by watching a documnetary on tv . do you like watgchimg tv ? i love shark tank but it?ss urprising knowing most deals that ard made ade never enacted .
9959,455,agent_1,i love shark tank ! i wonder why the deals fall through ?
9960,455,agent_2,no teling but it' worth loooking into to find out ! do you also like the simpson's ? it's funny homer hed 188 jobs over the first 400 episodes . ha !
9961,455,agent_1,"i heard that but i can only ever remember a few . like the power plant , and didnt he work for the beer factory too ?"
9962,455,agent_2,"he's had so many , it's hard to keep track of . ha ! did you also know daniel radclife voiced the a character on th essimpson's greenhouse 9of horror xxi which was the cartoon parody of twilight's edxward culldn ?"
9963,455,agent_1,"no , ih ad hea4d something about radcliffe doing something but i didnt know that was it . that is near for sure . ringo starr actually narrated 52 episodes of thomas the tank engine ."
9964,455,agent_2,"did ye reall ? i never ,new that ! are you a fan of shakespeare ? i wouldn't mind seeing the two noble kinsmej made i tinto a tv show or film since it's his only work that ha snever been adapteds into either !"
9965,455,agent_1,"that is hard to eblieve , he has haf so many works , i woder why no one has evee picked up on that oen ."
9966,455,agent_2,"that'es a good question . hopefully someone will soon ! maybe we should call around and find out ! ha ! zspeaking of phones , hedy lamarr deserves a ton of praise for hel;ing invent the cellhone , gps and wifi back i nthe 1930s . where would we be without her ?"
9967,455,agent_1,"wow , all thew y back in the 30's ? it took so long to get all that developed !"
9968,455,agent_2,"ik know and can't believe it tokk that long . we owe her a lot of thanks ! anyway , can you also believe there's basically no corelatio nnetween bars and connection quality ? that surprised me ! well it was nice chatting with you today !"
9969,456,agent_1,"china sure has become a competitive xountry , what are your thoughts ?"
9970,456,agent_2,"i ageee , i can't believe china has a 375 billion dollar trade surplu swith the us . that's crazy !"
9971,456,agent_1,"that is so much money , china is becoming a titan and it kind of maoes me afraid , one of my concerns is the ttade surplus nad the theft of technology ."
9972,456,agent_2,"tre , it is always scary dealin gwith other countries , but we do get a lolt from china , and they buy 130 billion dollars worth of goods from us slo sounds like we can have a thing if we can keep going with it ."
9973,456,agent_1,"that is a good point , its mutually beneficial in the end , i think its yhe number 3 destination for our exports ."
9974,456,agent_2,"drfinitely , adn we are pretty sfe because we are expanding our devense spending if they do try anything , we have several asian allies so i think if we can all keep teh peace will benefi tus lzl ."
9975,456,agent_1,"i think a war would end us all thouhg , but its good to have allies and appea rstrong , i think thats one of the good things trump has done ."
9976,456,agent_2,"yes , w ereally need to stay on high alert at lal timesa nd hopefully t6rump did sign the bill to produce more mil8tary shikps from 280t o 326 . . . but no doubt we have to keep on top of them ."
9977,456,agent_1,"i agree we need to show strenght and hope we never have to use it , you know trump s not even on th etop 3 of the welathiezt presidents in us history ! !"
9978,456,agent_2,"we definitely do need to sfay aware . he is not ? wow , that is surprising ! isn't president trump a billionaire ? i think the wealthiest prezidesnts had a very good side job going lil"
9979,456,agent_1,"he's not ! his guest house is bigger htan the white house so i 2inder why he's not on thwt list , seems like the other preeidents ar ecrazy rich tehn ."
9980,456,agent_2,"i would htink for sure trump would be the wealthiest q maybr trump could make somr pop albums while in offic elike tne presidet in indonesia did ! haha , that would bring in more money ! tnen he could have concerts too ! haha m pretty crazy huh ?"
9981,456,agent_1,"aybe he can make it to the top 3 if he sold a decent amount of albums lol , it would be razy and it is hre fun to imagine ."
9982,456,agent_2,"wouldn't if ! i wonder if the president ever goes to any football games or goes to concerts , or rather have them come to hi mlol . . . . i love concert sand have been to many but not any lately ."
9983,456,agent_1,"i know the feeling , last time i went to a concert it was 2002 , the band was creed and i wa stotally disappointe d."
9984,456,agent_2,"oh no ! hayha , i heard htere was a alwsuit against creed at some point for the show being so bad ! i wen tto a small venue years agok to one of creeds concerts and it was fantastic . but he was dlean and sob4r by htat time too ."
9985,456,agent_1,"i see in 2002 the vocalist was viewed as a total mess , i like the4 band and they have good songs ,s o much talent wasted ."
9986,456,agent_2,"right ! but wehn i saw scott stapp he was not creed anymor eit was him doing a solo career , he was pretty high an ddrunk for many years but he did get better . speaking of concerts , the ramoens played over 2 , 200 concerts whilet ouring on s6op for 20o ye3ar s! wehat a crazy life !"
9987,456,agent_1,"i know , thats a lot of concerts , its a shame i never mad eit to on e, do 7ou like the ramones ?"
9988,456,agent_2,"i like the ramones but they are not a favorite . i like a few of their songs . i like linkin park a lot but didn't get to see them before chester passed away . . . . . they played over 300 concerts in 2001 alone , is hould have tried to go to one then . i loved them , stikl do but its not the same ."
9989,456,agent_1,"im still vetting over chestedrs death , so sad , 5the world of music lost6 a lot that day"
9990,457,agent_1,"hello ! did you know that the top 3 wealthiest presidens were jfk , george washkngton , and jefferson ?"
9991,457,agent_2,"yez , i did , inferesting . i thibk they owned alot of land ."
9992,457,agent_1,i believe so too . up until 1805 the vice presidenjt was decided by who th erunner up was in the presidentoal election . interesting because there proabbly would have been 2 different opinions on issues of the time in the white house .
9993,457,agent_2,"yes , that is interesting . its good times have changed ."
9994,457,agent_1,yes . htere was once a president banana who wast he 1st president of zimbabwe ! lol
9995,457,agent_2,"isn;t that a crazy name . also , the presidetn of indon3siq makes pop ablums ."
9996,457,agent_1,that's something ! you wouldn't tgink he woul dhave the time to do that while in office .
9997,457,agent_2,"ik now , do you like to go to concerts ?"
9998,457,agent_1,"i love them ! i ,ikde the small club concerts now . i used to like the big ones that had big stage shows int he arehas . but , not too many bands put on a bkg stage sh9w anymore ."
9999,457,agent_2,i know wat you mean . althoug hwhere i am i se ealot are coming throughout the year . seeing a concer tat th eancient roman amphitheatre .
10000,457,agent_1,that would be neat ! in 1972 pink floyd recorded a live concert at an ancient roman amlhithe4ater in pompeii with no audience !
10001,457,agent_2,the sound must be very good tehre as well as interesting to look at q
10002,457,agent_1,yes . i agee ! there's another ancient roman amphitheater in croatia tha tthey still yse for concerts !
10003,457,agent_2,i'm sure that is interestin gas aell to see . the band creed must hve put on a bad shw to have lawsuits againsxt them in 2002 . i don'tk now anything about them .
10004,457,agent_1,they must have really stunk the olace up that night . lo linin park played a lot of shows in 2001 a total of 324 !
10005,457,agent_2,thats' nonstop touring . i would think it would be tiring . the ramones have played alot of gig jn a 20 yea rperiod .
10006,457,agent_1,how many gigs have the ramones played during that span ?
10007,457,agent_2,"2 , 263 , can you believe that ?"

10027,458,agent_1,"i watched the superbowl . i thought it was terrible , but that may just be me . so boring this year ."
10028,458,agent_2,i think it was probably better hte year before . there was a big comeback . this year i was a defensive battle . i wantedt he underdog to win . too bad .
10029,458,agent_1,"yeah , i tend to think low scoring gaems are boring . well , nice chatting with you !"

10036,459,agent_1,it does i only know thzt the super bowl is in the first week of february .
10037,459,agent_2,they only rest lne of the 17 weeks of the season .
10038,459,agent_1,yes it's called a bye wee k. apparently the patriots fasn have their own creed call3d in bill we trust .
10039,459,agent_2,"that is impresive , also you had asked about aaron rodgers , he became the highest ;aid player"
10040,459,agent_1,yeah four year for 134 million . wow . uard to believe at one time bowlers made more than top nfl players .
10041,459,agent_2,he has been the most valuable nfl player twice
10042,459,agent_1,well he deserves it e wors harda nd he's the same age as tom grady so he doesn't have nay excuses .
10043,459,agent_2,"hye is very hopeful , he wrote a p0st on instagram were she shgows he is very excited and looking fo5ward for amazing memories !"
10044,459,agent_1,the pacakrds were my favorite team . did you know ther eis now ritten rule which prevents women from joining teh nfl ?
10045,459,agent_2,"that is so eat ! i would to see thath appen , but i do not think it will anytime soon"
10046,459,agent_1,i think they should just mwke an all female league like the wnba .
10047,459,agent_2,"probably a god idea , did youk now there is only one left handed qb in the nfl ?"
10048,459,agent_1,tha'ts aol the nfl proruced ? do you knoww ho is it ?
10049,459,agent_2,his name is kellan moore ! also there have only been two african american qb that have been winners in the superbowl
10050,459,agent_1,"really , wow ! i know teh huddle was originally invented because of a deaf quarterbac k."
10051,459,agent_2,"that is a nice beginning of th ehuddle , who was that qb ?"
10052,459,agent_1,his nam was paul d hubbard . xo you know abker mayfield ?
10053,459,agent_2,rthat is so cool . well it was nice talking t0 you . have a good one
10054,460,agent_1,hi how are you today ?

10056,460,agent_1,yds absolutely ! i love football . do you ?
10057,460,agent_2,"yup . unfortumately my favorite team , the ravens , were eliminated . i guess that's what happens in a single elimination tournament ."
10058,460,agent_1,the nfl has no wri5ten rule qgainst femal eplaywers ; womenw ould in fact be allowed if they met hte league's elig8bility requirements . that would be wild .
10059,460,agent_2,i can't see it .m aybe a kicker . and they use tracking chips i npads to record the player's moves .
10060,460,agent_1,yea they put microchips in a lot of stuff these days .
10061,460,agent_2,"tehse are suposed to trac kthe player's moves , as well as the all's velocity and rotation ."
10062,460,agent_1,all that and then ana verage nfl game only has 11 minutes of lie gameplay
10063,460,agent_2,tuat's crazy . did you know that the first nfl playoff game was played in 9132 .
10064,460,agent_1,wow no i did not .
10065,460,agent_2,"yup , it was playe don an8 0 yard ;og dirt field ."
10066,460,agent_1,the averafe lifetime earnings of an jegineer is higher than hte zveragew lifetime earnings of an nfl playe qansd an avwrage mlb player . and now lol
10067,460,agent_2,that doesn'ft surprise me . most profeasional athletes don't play for very long . mat tpatricia gas a nice fall back career . he i sa rocket scientist .
10068,460,agent_1,true ! that's very true and very interesting .
10069,460,agent_2,he actualy graduatedf rom a school wose fight song includes some tdigomnometry terms .
10070,460,agent_1,"according to canadianl aw , all radios are required to have at least 40 percent of the music played be canadian ."
10071,460,agent_2,that's strange for a democracy . did youk now that there is act7ally ar adio station that translates solar activioty into sound ?
10072,460,agent_1,yes i heard about this also . its been good talking to you .
10073,460,agent_2,you as well . i hope you have a nice evening .
10074,460,agent_1,thasnks you t0oo !
10075,461,agent_1,dikd you know that a deaf quarterback came up with the huddle ? i guess it would block the other team from seeing his hand signals
10076,461,agent_2,that's an interesting fact . do you enjoy football and the nfl ?
10077,461,agent_1,"football is ok , i don't really like the nfl but i tolerate it , what i think is crazy is there is only 1 lefthanded quarterback that plays ikn th nfl right now , i wonde rif that gives him an advantage"
10078,461,agent_2,waell the nfl has done a decent job as it is now reckgnized as among the 4 major sport leagues in north america .
10079,461,agent_1,"yes that is true , they definitely are successfu l, i guess i don't get why so mwny people watch nf lgames when there is , on average , onlyu 11 mins of actuql football gameplay in a whole game"
10080,461,agent_2,itm ay because they put a lot of dedication into their profession . did you know that nfl implantc hips into player's shoulderpads to record their everymove to use their sata for better plays and understadning of footbzll ? they even put them in the footballs themselves
10081,461,agent_1,"that is interesting but also knc of creepy , i guess it's good or getting all kinds of interesting stats , hopefully they don't apoply them to real life and start tracking normal people wit6h that stuff"
10082,461,agent_2,"it is interesting how they are trying to track gelocity , rotation , ball speed and location . i wonder how well they have3 implemented this new data . regarding your opinion on tracking normal oeople , i agree ."
10083,461,agent_1,"ya , and i don't like that new orelans cheerleaders srent allowed to eat in the same restaurant as players , lpike i don't get wgy they cant do that , maybe inc ase of sexual harrasment ? but that s3ems feally tupid"
10084,461,agent_2,"i think that is more a new orl;ean sa8nts problem than an nfl prblem . in fact , the nfl has no written rule against female players"
10085,461,agent_1,"that is wild , do you htink we'll see a femel player in our lifetime ? what is crazy is that the averag eengineer makes more in their lifetime than the average nfl player , you'd thinkt hzat'd be reversed"
10086,461,agent_2,well i htink that is because an averwge nfl player is active f9r far less than than an average engineer
10087,461,agent_1,"that's true , what age do nfl players usual,ly retire ? i know they get problems with their joints and also brains otentially from all the impacts"
10088,461,agent_2,"i'm not sure , but those 11 minutes of gameplay sure tawke their toll , especially since tbey result in severe injuries"
10089,461,agent_1,"ye s, it oesn't zeem like a lot oft ime per game , now i know why i getb ored watching football ! htere is literally not much action happening , it always seems to dra gout forever espeically when a game gets near the end and they start using timeouts"
10090,461,agent_2,"speaking off ootball , are you familiar with alex smith of the redskins ?"
10091,461,agent_1,"i hav enot heard of him no , i can't say i know a lot about football unfortunately"
10092,461,agent_2,he is ar ookie for the red skins that some feel will lead the new ear of running backs coming around the nfl league
10093,461,agent_1,"ah interesting , well they should make wjure to putt he tracking chips on him so that they ca nstudy his moves and see how they can improve everyone else !"
10094,461,agent_2,"i agree he seems to be good all around with no real weakness in his game . from pass ame to running the abl l, even in rotections , he iw well versed ."
10095,461,agent_1,"what is his appeal ? i know that there is only one left handed quarterback , and again maybe that gived him an advantage , what advantage do you think alex smity has ?"
10096,462,agent_1,do you follow the nfl ?
10097,462,agent_2,not really . i only watch the superbwp every year .
10098,462,agent_1,sp you watc hthe superbowl at the beginnign of this motnh ?
10099,462,agent_2,yes . it was a lot of fun . i was with a big group at jmy workplace ? someone in the group won a lot of money and he was really happy . i had no idea that they put chips in the palyers shouleer5 pads . that is very interesting .
10100,462,agent_1,"it is interesting i agree , speciawlly because of all the cool stats taken out of them , the football alos has a chip . technology is really cool"
10101,462,agent_2,i am wonderiung waht the am radio station is to hear tghe sounds trom jupite now !
10102,462,agent_1,i didn6 know that was possible it mudst eb amazijg to tune in the radio and listen to the rsdipo storms
10103,462,agent_2,"it's very intresting . i think i had heard of ' foxhole fadios , but i had no idea that they were made out of razorbaldes and pejncils ."
10104,462,agent_1,i bet that chaged lifes baci in war m did you hear about that latin enws broadcast sation ? kts been around since 1989
10105,462,agent_2,that is really interesting . i guess that woudl be fhe onlyw ay to pick up latin or try to listen to it ! i rally lie listening to otherr adio statiohs or music or dj's from around the world .
10106,462,agent_1,"ih ead pandora radio is a great service 6hat can help you witht hat , do you subscribe ?"
10107,462,agent_2,no . i have simple radio . they hav4 an app and you can also listen online .
10108,462,agent_1,"oh i see , so you dont have the app ,"
10109,462,agent_2,i don't ha ethe pandorqa app . there are so many muskic app sto listen to or have now .
10110,462,agent_1,i guess they are reay i have spotify an heres like a radio segment in it as well .
10111,462,agent_2,yeah . it's really itneresting that the circular huddle was ceeated by a dea fquarterback . i'm not a bif enough person to hav eever played football .
10112,462,agent_1,"me neither , it alwahys seemed like a dangerous gsme for m e, its a good thing qwb have protection from th3 defensive line"
10113,462,agent_2,"yeah . also , cojcussionsa re a real thing . maube there should be some sort of chips in the players helmets as well ."
10114,462,agent_1,they shuld that way e can really tell the impact of hits and the consequecnes on the long run
10115,462,agent_2,"i'm surprised htere aren't slready . you'd think tha tthat would also be as important , if not more important , tham tracking the pla6er smovements throug their shoulder pads !"
10116,462,agent_1,"magybe there working on a tech that can do that , changing the rules is a must in order to protect olayers ."
10117,463,agent_1,hi ho ware you doing today ? do you listent o the radio ?
10118,463,agent_2,i do like listenintg to the radio it is confusing to me how it works with the radio waves and the energy
10119,463,agent_1,the information is transmitted by shifting amplitude and frequency .
10120,463,agent_2,yes did you know tha5t jupiter has radio storms so strong that hey van be picked up on am radio ?
10121,463,agent_1,"yes , that makes sense . as torm ie basically a giant burst of energy . that is cool . i wonder wuhat they sound like ."
10122,463,agent_2,i have no ieea but i would probably prefer to listen to it rather than a finnish pr5ogram that broadcasts in latin !
10123,463,agent_1,"yes , that news program in latins eem san odedity that would only exist in finland . i wonde rhow many listeners there arw ."
10124,463,agent_2,i am ot sure . i wonder if it is on the website where yu can listen to thousands of episodes of classic radio drama ?
10125,463,agent_1,"i doubt it , but i bet it is somewhwere on the internet . those old radiod hows had the8r charm . i should check them out ."
10126,463,agent_2,definitely i would love to hear war of the worlds tha6 is at imeless clsssic !
10127,463,agent_1,taht is a classic . i havent listened to that in a hwile . peopoe were really scared . strange .
10128,463,agent_2,yss did you know you can make a radio using a razorlade and a pencil ? wwii soldiers did it all the time
10129,463,agent_1,i guess those guys have th eincentive to put something together in the foxhole . probably not listening to tue news in latin though lol
10130,463,agent_2,no doubt ! but would that be better than listening to canaxian music ? radio sations have to play 40 percent caandian music up there
10131,463,agent_1,"i buess everybody in canada knows rush and neil young sogns by heart now . yeah , the govt wants to rotect its artists l."
10132,463,agent_2,i think i am ready for football to start again . do you watch the nfl ?
10133,463,agent_1,i sometimes watch . usually i try to watch the super bowl . you ?
10134,463,agent_2,"i am a fan when i was a kid i wanted to be a pro player , because women are allowed , but it was not to be ."
10135,463,agent_1,"i think that women could make their way into theg ame . anyway , great chat !"
10136,463,agent_2,yes there is only 11 minutes of actual gameplay i migth could survive that !
10137,463,agent_1,i dont think i would survive . 11 minutes of moral combat ? no way . have a good day !
10138,463,agent_2,have a great day !
10139,464,agent_1,did you know that jupiter as a radio storm that you a pick up on a regular am radio ?
10140,464,agent_2,"no , i didn't know tuhat . how interestign ! i did hear that the sun's soalr activity has ben translated into sounds like music ."
10141,464,agent_1,"now i fidn't know that , did you know that canadianl aw requires 40 percent of their music to be of canadian origin"
10142,464,agent_2,no0pe . i wonder what the other 60 percent might b .
10143,464,agent_1,"ya , i would sayt that fro mmy experience ghat means that 40 percent of th musicv on a canadian radio is probably not very good haha"
10144,464,agent_2,right ! ! are you interested in football history ? i'm looking forwaerd to thes uper bowl comkng up . the original first nfl playoff ame was way back in 1392 .
10145,464,agent_1,"that is wild , to be honest i kind of thouhgt taht playoffg ame happened earlier than that , i do know that the highest scoring football game was 2220 although i don't remeber what teams were playjng"
10146,464,agent_2,"wow . that must ahve been some bring game ! the game today is so technologically involved . they even use tracking chips to monitor the bqll speed , etc . and the players moves ."
10147,464,agent_1,"that is crazy , also wild to me is the circular huddle was developed by a deaf quarterback so that other teams couldn't read his hands signing"
10148,464,agent_2,how interesting ! i wonder how he would call the plays behind the offensive line to initiate the play . since the qb has to call the plays .
10149,464,agent_1,"that is a great question , i wonder if eh just didn't and would just do whateve rpaly they decidded in th ehusdle , but sometimes thdy have to call an audible , so i just don't know !"
10150,464,agent_2,gere are some good qbs in football today . sinceh e i sthd mastermind on the field controlling the pays . did you know that russell wilson is also am ajor league basebal player ?
10151,464,agent_1,"i didn't know that , did you know that baker mayfield could beat hise ntire collge at oneopnone halo 3 ? i was amaizing at halk 1 and 2 ack int he day , i only kind of playled 3"
10152,464,agent_2,"waht is halo 1 , 2 , 3 ? i know baker mayfield is in the limelight . . . compared to brett favre and john elway ."
10153,464,agent_1,"well they are videogames . they're pretty ol dat 6his point , but i liked them a lot whe ni was younger . i don't really follow football , is bakser a rofessional player at this point ?"
10154,464,agent_2,"yes , young player . wiht a lot of hype . he plays with the cleveland browns . i believe it' shis first year ."
10155,464,agent_1,"ah i see , did you ever play video games ? if you hadn' yheard of halo then i'm thinking maybe not haha , but i'm curious , i gave up videogames a while agot o play piano , it's eben a couple y4ars at this point"
10156,464,agent_2,"oh , i lovs pinao jusic . i cannot play , but can read music and struggle to llay the note s. i don't play video games , but like to play some bames online ."
10157,464,agent_1,"ya you're not missing anything , i realized that all the time i put into video games , i could have pt into music and had a useful skill out of it , so tyat is why i stopped playing , if you cab read musi cthat is almost half the batle haha"
10158,464,agent_2,"reading music is oen thing , making it come through my fingers is something else ! i'm sure you chose the better eoad with your music ! ! thanks for sharinv , it was rea ttalkikng with you ."
10159,464,agent_1,"great talking with 7ou , good luck with your musi ccareer , you can learn to play at any age !"
10160,465,agent_1,do you like football ?
10161,465,agent_2,i do . i played inh s and i'm a chiefs fan . . . i actually like colege better4 than the nfl .
10162,465,agent_1,"nice . i'm no ttoo into football , i guess because each game has only on average 11 mnutes of live gameplay ."
10163,465,agent_2,i'm wondering abou tthat . . . seems short . i think it is tru3 that the nfl has no rule sagainst women playing .
10164,465,agent_1,i wonder if we will edver see a woman player .
10165,465,agent_2,"i think so , probaly starting with a kicker . thy will probably have chips in everything by then ."
10166,465,agent_1,"right , i heard that now they hav them in footballs an dshoulder pads ."
10167,465,agent_2,that's a far cry from making a radio from razor bladesa nd pebcil slike thes oldiers in ww i did . how is that possibel ;? admkirable . . .
10168,465,agent_1,"i know , i'd love to learn how to make one . i wonder if itw ould pick up jupiter's storms ? i heard they can be picked up bya n am eadio ."
10169,465,agent_2,probably . . . jupiter is so powerful . . . you could pribably pick up canada where 40 percent of the music is guaranteed to be canadian .
10170,465,agent_1,"yaha , i wondet what canaduan music i am missing . i only know of drake , justin bieber and celine dion"
10171,465,agent_2,i think sarag mclaughlin is canadian . she's great . there is a website that has classic radio dramas tyhat might be interesting .
10172,465,agent_1,does that cost anything ?
10173,465,agent_2,"it's free . . . speaking of free , qb alex smith quizzed out of his first two years of college no tuition paid there . . ."
10174,465,agent_1,and he stadted working on jis master?s degree before becoming the first overall pick in the 2005 nfl draft . good to have a backup plan !
10175,465,agent_2,no kidding . . . he was a pretty good qb for the chiefs too . . . i remember the circular huddle but i had no idea it was that way because of a deaf qb in the past .
10176,465,agent_1,"yewh , he did not want the other team to read his hand signal s. very interesting ."
10177,465,agent_2,times have changed . qb's are now deciding whether to play football or compete with video games . such is gaker mayfield's plight . . .
10178,465,agent_1,well i guess professional ijdeo gaming can be lucrative too . so he claimec eh could beat anyone at his universi5y n halo 3 .
10179,465,agent_2,"i didn't realize it pays that much to be 8in the gamihg world . i'm sill wondering if , over the long run , engineers makem ore than the average nfl player . i'm an engineer and i ain't seeing it ."
10180,465,agent_1,"i tyhink engineers manage thei money better than profeszsional sports players though . i wonder if tom brady is doing all right . i's good he did not give up on football in high dchool .t hey never started him as the abckup quarterback even thougn they were doing srribly . time to go look up some more football facts , thish as gotten me quite interested . see you !"
10181,466,agent_1,do you like footbal l;
10182,466,agent_2,i am a big fan of hte nfl every fal lwatching the league get whittled from 32 teams to one ultimte winner ite great fun !
10183,466,agent_1,yes it is ! you see alex smith took so many ap tests that he entered college as a junior ?
10184,466,agent_2,yes and was workin gon a nasters when he go5 drafted !
10185,466,agent_1,that's awesome . . . . love whent ehse high pai dpr5offessionals twake thei rerucation seriously !
10186,466,agent_2,y4es bugt in rea;ity an engineer will make more in his lifetime than a nfl player
10187,466,agent_1,yeqh . . . but i9f they control their fiannces correctly they can make soooo much more !
10188,466,agent_2,that is true . all for only 11 minutes of gameplay a week
10189,466,agent_1,lol . . . yeah ! now that is craz that us as fans sit their for like 3 hours for taht littlw bit of actkon ?
10190,466,agent_2,exactly . now if we could gwt female players into teh game that would make it more interesting
10191,466,agent_1,yes definitely ! i could definitely see a female kickefr n the league !
10192,466,agent_2,for sure . but probably not for the saints they seem to be pretty antiwomen
10193,466,agent_1,i saw that . . . i don't understand in todays day how they geta way aith that ?
10194,466,agent_2,yesc herrleaders should be able to continue eatin gin a restaurant when olayers come in
10195,466,agent_1,i agrde . . or just make it whoever is thsir first does not have to eave !
10196,466,agent_2,that would make more sense ! i bet they want 6he tracking chipst hey use in the game used all the time
10197,466,agent_1,i a sure they do ! i woder whn other sports will start using those tracking chips ?
10198,466,agent_2,yes it does seem really helpful i9 could see it workingh wrll in soccer
10199,466,agent_1,definitely ! crazy kelplan moore i the onlyl eft handed quarterback
10200,466,agent_2,that is strange considering how many lefty pithcers there are in baseball
10201,466,agent_1,so true ! great hcat . . . have a good one !
10202,467,agent_1,hi how are you ?
10203,467,agent_2,"im great , do you like alex smith ?"
10204,467,agent_1,i dl not know muc about him other than he plyed in kansas city ! xdo you like him ?
10205,467,agent_2,"i do lik ehim yeah , he is the qb ot6 e redskin sand i think he's good"
10206,467,agent_1,thar is good . crazy how the average nfl game only has 11 inutes of live game play .
10207,467,agent_2,"it does seem like a lot longer than that , did you hear about those tracking chips players have in their shoulders ?"
10208,467,agent_1,yea they also put them in geh footballs . as long as gbrady did't deflate the trackers out of the balls ! ha
10209,467,agent_2,"i guessed they designed them keepin that in mind lol , well the chips in the shoulder are to ttack every move of hte playere in the fie.d , cool stats"
10210,467,agent_1,it is funny that the saints polayers ar forbiddn fro meating in the same restaurants as the cheereaders .
10211,467,agent_2,"that rule makes me so mad , the nfl shouldn't allow that , do you know who coach matt patricia is ?"
10212,467,agent_1,i do not . who is that ?
10213,467,agent_2,"he is a coach abd also a rocket scientist , the only one in the nfl , really smart man"
10214,467,agent_1,inte5resting ! i didn't know the average lifetime earnings of an engineer is higher than football players .
10215,467,agent_2,yeah apparently they earn mor ewithou tall the injyries esociated with te wpot and all the brain damage
10216,467,agent_1,that is gtrue . did you know jupiter has radio storms so strong you can hear them on am radio
10217,467,agent_2,"no didnt know about those storm s, do you listen to the radio a lot ?"
10218,467,agent_1,not really much anymore . i definitely wouldn't if i lived in canada since it is requiredt o have at least 40 percent of them usic played in canadian .
10219,467,agent_2,"i think its s good law , it promotes local talen tso thats great , a lo6 of good artist shave benefit from this i think"
10220,467,agent_1,that is true . do you listen to the radio a lot ?
10221,467,agent_2,"not much , but i do listen to it on my way to work ,t here is also a radio sation that translatrs solar wctivi5y into sound , gts boring after a whi,e"
10222,467,agent_1,that is crazy ! nice chatting with you !
10223,467,agent_2,"it is , the radioj ust amazes me ,h ow i6t works and how we use it , is been nice chatting have a good evneing ."
10224,468,agent_1,"hi , dp youf ollow the nfl much ?"
10225,468,agent_2,"hi there . i do follow the nfl from tiome to time . i did watch the super bowl as well , what about you ?"
10226,468,agent_1,i didn?t get a chance to watch the sb . i figured taht tom brady adn thge pats wouhld win . i heard it was a snorefest .
10227,468,agent_2,yeah it was pretty boring . it doesn't surprise me that the average nfl game only has about 11 muinutes of live gameplay . that seemed abou tright for the super bowl lol
10228,468,agent_1,"11 minutes ? plenty of time for commercials . i prefer games with flow , like basketball . on a perminute basis , t6hose nfl guys get paid a lot ."
10229,468,agent_2,"geah i agree witn yoh . what do you think about the tracking chip sthat they use on the f9eld ? ik now they get good stats , it's just crazy that that kind of technology exist to me"
10230,468,agent_1,its' good for und4rstanding the flow of the game . could hslp understqand situations thzt lead to injury and concussion . player safety is important .
10231,468,agent_2,yep i agree with you . i hope they use those stats to help prevent teh brain injuries that can happen . do you like the new orleans saints by the way ? you kno3 h9w they treat their cheerloeaders ?
10232,468,agent_1,"the cheerleaders really are at the bottom of the totem pole . long hours , low pay ,l ittle respect ."
10233,468,agent_2,"no respect , i think it's weird that they have to leave a restaurant if a player enters , that's definitely something that is probably a relic from the past , do you know if other teams have the same rule ?"
10234,468,agent_1,i don'tk no3w . no saints must have had a problem with relations between players and cheerleaders to create a rule lkke that . no partying together . something like that .
10235,468,agent_2,"yeah that makes sense . because i havne't heard of that rule with any other team . what about the rule for female players ? apparently there is no rule afainst it , whihc is interestijg"
10236,468,agent_1,i guesst hey never imagined that aomen would want or be able to play . other sports might not have such a rule either .
10237,468,agent_2,"yeah that makes sense . i don't think taht women can play basketball or anything like that , at least in the nba l, but maybe i'm wrong ? do you ahve a favorite quarterback byt he wzy ?"
10238,468,agent_1,"ghere is a wnba , bu5t the money is not as good . i dont' have a favorite qb , but i did like joe montaan and stevd young ."
10239,468,agent_2,"yes i like those guys . i also like tom brwdy personally , although i know a lot of people don't , he has some weir things about him like the fact that he's never eaten a strawberry befo4e lol . what do you think abougt baker mayfield ?"
10240,468,agent_1,is brady a vegan too ? e probably has an allergy to strawberries . baker mayfield ? don't know him .
10241,468,agent_2,"yeah he was a quarterback for university of oklahoma , he was also a majorg amer ,h e was going to be a prog amer instead of a football player , i gues she was reslly good at halo 3 , i was also really good at that game badck in the day haha"
10242,468,agent_1,"i gues you could make money as a gamer , but the nfl is probably a great way to mee tpeople and make cash ."
10243,468,agent_2,"yep i agree with you . if you can make money in the nfl , you're probably better off doing that than ppaying video games lol . do you know hte story behind the circular huddle ?"
10244,468,agent_1,"i believe a deaf qb wanted to shield his hand signals from th other team . i was surprised bt that fac t, but i fguess any one will skil;l can plqay the game . anyway , i enjoyed chatting !"
10245,468,agent_2,"yes i think the circular huddle4 is genius actually . thatw ay no one could see the digns he was making , and that's could not read the plays that he wanted to do , have a great night by the way"
10246,469,agent_1,good morning ! are you a football an ?
10247,469,agent_2,"i am a football fan , 32 teams teo devision , its a great sport"
10248,469,agent_1,yes ! did you know that htere is only 1 left handed qb in the nfl anf that is kllan mokore ?
10249,469,agent_2,only one in the whole league ? is he ag razt qb ?
10250,469,agent_1,i think he's a backup . baker mayfield fr0m the browns once almost quit football to pursu efull time compettive gaming . thats ounds like htat would have bren a scary gamble to take .
10251,469,agent_2,"yeah vaming doesnt seem like a rich industry or career path , pro football players must earn more money"
10252,469,agent_1,definately ! it pays more to be an engineer than an avrrage nfl or mlb player bgecause ovefr a lifetime an enginreer ears more than those players .
10253,469,agent_2,"well engineers work for a longer time , so it makes sense , di dyou hear about qb laex smith ? i think his a great role model to follow"
10254,469,agent_1,i didn't h4ear . wha tdid he do ?
10255,469,agent_2,he took apt est kn hihg school nad entered university as a ujunior . he receved a degree in just two years and then began working on a masters degree
10256,469,agent_1,nice ! good for nim ! did you know that the circular huddle was created by a deaf qb so tye other players could readh is hand sugnal s?
10257,469,agent_2,"i didnt know that ,h e left a legacy thanks to that , now all teams do it , i bet he didtn had that in mind whn hue implemented the strategy"
10258,469,agent_1,no . i would guess he didn't . i wonder if w'ell see a female nfl player anyt ime soon since there's written no rul eagainst female players in the nlf ?
10259,469,agent_2,i think females are at a disadvantage .
10260,469,agent_1,i coud ijmagine some of the hits . i wast hinking like a kicker or a punter maybe .
10261,469,agent_2,"oh yeah , htose can be good positions , i guess it can happen some day ,"
10262,469,agent_1,i'm sure if they do they will have tracking chips on their shoulder pads like they do now3 so they can record every move on the field .
10263,469,agent_2,that seesm bit invasive but i gues sall kinds of stats are taken out of those chips
10264,469,agent_1,"yes . they even have chips in the football to track velocity , etc . getting a little too technical i think for a sport ."
10265,469,agent_2,do you have a favorite team ?
10266,469,agent_1,i like the steeelrs !
10267,469,agent_2,"they are a great team mine are the ;patriots , i thinhk tjey share a recofd ."
10268,470,agent_1,football fan ?
10269,470,agent_2,"oh yes , i love ronaldo and messi ! can't seem t have enough of them ! ; ,"
10270,470,agent_1,"ah , how about american footabll ? dic you see the bengals' loss sunday ?"
10271,470,agent_2,"naah , i djdn't who were you cheering for ?"
10272,470,agent_1,the bengals . datlon had a thumb injury that ended his season . can you believe a thumb is that importan t? i caught it on the radiol so i didn't really see it .
10273,470,agent_2,"yeah thumbs were vsry important in our evolution : , plol , hey how can one , quarterbad k, amke the touchdown pass o himself ? i mean . . . how ?"
10274,470,agent_1,amhbe it's time fot a woman to step in nad take over as qb ? the nlf has no official p0rohibition against women quarterbacks .
10275,470,agent_2,do you think it's a good idea ? are they physically ready ?
10276,470,agent_1,there's the rub . there's only 11 minutes of live gameplay so it's not like they're benching 500lbs for 2 hourss traight .
10277,470,agent_2,"i guess you're not lookin gfor an actual converstion here , just copying the subjects from the articlw . . . qre you not afrid tehy will reject our wor ?"
10278,470,agent_1,article ? i was discussing football . gues the bengals will have to start drismel .
10279,470,agent_2,i aed you if you think women are ready for thag game ? like physicaloy ? i guess you've missed that question . . .
10280,470,agent_1,"possibly , they should probably protect their thumbs though . you never know whaf could get injured ."
10281,470,agent_2,"with all the money invested in that game , do you think they would risk to out women into the field ? i meawn can they be as strong or fast ?"
10282,470,agent_1,asome might . all you have to do is meet the eligibility requiremetns . if a woman could meet those then why7 not ?
10283,470,agent_2,like i said i wonder what the investorfsw ould say if they wo9uld see woman in a team they invested millions if dollars . . .
10284,470,agent_1,it's enough of an ovelty that ir might work . all the moneys' at the top . an engineer earns more in his or ehr lifetime tgat the average nl playe .
10285,470,agent_2,engineer ? really ? i saw soem numbers how much nf lplayers earn . . . little hwrd for me to belive in that . . .
10286,470,agent_1,not everyone in the nlf earns thge giant paydays and not all play for that ;ong . if you're colin kapernick you may get kicked out earlier than you want for your activism and lose money there too .
10287,470,agent_2,"i guess you're rihgt . . . mr . kapernick better start training tl be an engineer ; ,"
10288,470,agent_1,"good money there .,"
10289,471,agent_1,waht do you think o feli manning ?
10290,471,agent_2,he seems like a nice guy . he's had a long and pretrty good career until recently .
10291,471,agent_1,"it seems his most likely replacement , kyle lauletta , got into some serious trouble , almost running over ac op and other htings ."
10292,471,agent_2,oh wow ! i did not hear ab0ut that . has he been charged ?
10293,471,agent_1,"yes , the giangs have swen betyter days . theyw ere 17 when it happened ."
10294,471,agent_2,"yeah they7 certwainly fell off in theur performance in teh last few years ,. do you enjoy foogball ?"
10295,471,agent_1,yes . it looks likoe the giants have another apternative in 3 1year old alex tanney but he has limoted experience .
10296,471,agent_2,i have not heard of him . hopefully he can bring the team back to where they used to be .
10297,471,agent_1,"it's nice that after laulegta' sarrest , rb barkley stick up fr him as a good man ."
10298,471,agent_2,"hopefully it was just ohe mistake and not represdntative of his charactdr . speaking of qb's , are you familiar with alex smith ?"
10299,471,agent_1,"yeah , he's th esmart guy that took so many ap tests that he startedc ollege as a junio ."
10300,471,agent_2,yes he did . he was actually working on his mastsr's when he was drafted . that's very impressive .
10301,471,agent_1,yes . i think i'ts odd that kellan moore is then only lefthanded qb in the nfl . you sees o many lefthanded pitchers in mbl .
10302,471,agent_2,oh wo w! you would think there wouldb e more but when i think about it i don't rememebr seeing a qb throw w2ith his left hnad .
10303,471,agent_1,me either . . . the circular huddle isc ommon though . it started because of a deaf qb so the other team couldn't read his hand signals .
10304,471,agent_2,i would think it would be very difficlt to be a deaf qb . you couldn't hear play changes or calls in your helmet adn you'd think yo'd get sacked more .
10305,471,agent_1,"yes , that must hve been a long time ago . did you kbow ww i soldiers made radios out of razor blades and pencils ?"
10306,471,agent_2,i did not . i had no idxea you could make a radio with so little .
10307,471,agent_1,"all i kno is that i would p;robably just end up cutting myself . back to football , it's interesting that the nflh as not rules against women playing . gof or it ladies !"
10308,471,agent_2,i agree . i see no reason even with the size difference why tey could not play .
10309,471,agent_1,sure . why nt ? thanks for the chat !
10310,472,agent_1,i was disappointed to hear about kyle lauletta's arrest .
10311,472,agent_2,what happened ?
10312,472,agent_1,he almost rqn a police officer over with his car outside of new york citu .
10313,472,agent_2,"thats right , he was pretty resistant and disresptectful too right ?"
10314,472,agent_1,"yes , i heard thath e gave them a hard time . i eas glad t hear there was no mention o beng intoxicated , though ."
10315,472,agent_2,i wnder hgow the giants are going to discipline him ?
10316,472,agent_1,i don't know . i think their hands are a bit tied becsuse there are not many options for quarterbakc on the team .
10317,472,agent_2,i was holing htat the g8ants would put hnim to play instead of eli
10318,472,agent_1,i think they will . eli is already 37 years old .
10319,472,agent_2,th4 giants have done so poorly htis year . it s such a surprise !
10320,472,agent_1,seriouysly ! a 17 record i sterrible !
10321,472,agent_2,i can understand why obj is so frustrated !
10322,472,agent_1,i hope they do better in wee k10
10323,472,agent_2,"they nave too many tslented players , it is time for the coach and wli to go in my opinion ."
10324,472,agent_1,"agreed . despite the arrest newes , i thinkl auletta will do well f0r the team ."
10325,472,agent_2,i haven't sene much of his play but he deserves ac hance to play right now .
10326,472,agent_1,it couldn?t get any worse and their only other option for qb is tanney .
10327,472,agent_2,elis' job may have been saved by the fact they have won their lqst coupl eof games l
10328,472,agent_1,"i wouldn't be surprised if he retires soon , anyway ."
10329,472,agent_2,"i was never a big fan of his , i never considered him to be a good qb despite his sb wins ."
10330,472,agent_1,"i am not a fan , either . time for some fresh talent !"
10331,472,agent_2,i hope they lose this week . . . lol !
10332,473,agent_1,do you think the qb is the most important plater in a football team ?
10333,473,agent_2,"well , he calls all the palys and touches the bal on almo tevery offensive play . so , i could see him beingt he most impo5tant player ."
10334,473,agent_1,"yeah the qb is involved in every offensive play , 5hey are protected but the offensive line , so a good qb will always need a good offensive line as well"
10335,473,agent_2,that's so true .
10336,473,agent_1,"do you know who to, brqdy is ?"
10337,473,agent_2,"yes , i know he goat , ne wenlgand patriots quarterback ."
10338,473,agent_1,"yeah the goat , the same ne , weol he used to be on the bench when he was in hish igh school team , his team lost a lot o fgames and the coachd idnt know about the talented son to be hall of famer qb he haxd in his rooster"
10339,473,agent_2,"what a fool , i bet people still make fun of that coach to thi9s day !"
10340,473,agent_1,"i agree , i bet he regrets not puttig rbady on his team , that guy wouldnt recognizr talent even if it hit him in hte face"
10341,473,agent_2,"on a different note , did you kno jupiter has radio storms so strong that thy can be picked up and heard by an am radio ?"
10342,473,agent_1,"no i didnt know that , wonder what station , the radio is a great invention ,"
10343,473,agent_2,"yes , it is . i read in canada it's a law that at least 4 0percent of the music played must be canadian . have you heard about that ?"
10344,473,agent_1,"i havetn heard about that alw but seems fair , i like it , that way you promote local talent , there are some talented artist in canada"
10345,473,agent_2,"i can honestly only think of celine dio n, shanua twain , justin bieber . is there any others ? lol"
10346,473,agent_1,"yah theres also drake an di bet a couple more lol , there is alsot his copl site with drama episodes for free"
10347,473,agent_2,"i had heard about tha6 site , classic radio dramas you can listen ro for free . just how i wznt to spend my sp;are time . lol"
10348,473,agent_1,"there is qlso a latin news channel in the radio , that seems a bit boring ,"
10349,473,agent_2,"lol , wonder how many listeners it has ?"
10350,473,agent_1,"it musth ave at least some fans , the show has bene around since 1989 so it must be popular ,"
10351,473,agent_2,"oh myg oodness , i did not know that !"
10352,473,agent_1,"yeah sounds boring to me , i dont understan a word of latin"
10353,474,agent_1,do you like football ?
10354,474,agent_2,i do but i would rathe rgo to the live games than watch it on tv . do you kike radiko ?
10355,474,agent_1,"sometimes i listen to it , but mostly via internet ."
10356,474,agent_2,"yes , there's definitely tadio on the internet . radio technology isn't tha tnew bu tit is fasciating . radio waves carry inforjation suha s soudn by systematically modulation the propertie sof electromagneti cenergy was transmitted through space such as amplitude , frequency , phase , and pulse width ."
10357,474,agent_1,did you know kellan moore is the only lect handed qb i nthe nfl ?
10358,474,agent_2,"yes , ghat is unusual probably . did you know that baker mayfield , universty of oklahoma qb , once considered quitting footblal to pursje fulltime competitive gaming and claims to be ahle to beat ayoen at his school oneonone in halo 3 ?"
10359,474,agent_1,"no , i didn't know that . the nfl puts chips in players shoulder pads , were youh aware with tha t?"
10360,474,agent_2,"yes , so they can rrack the players moves . they also put trackinbg chip sinside the football qs well ."
10361,474,agent_1,"oh , that is pret5y cool . i wonder whagt they do with all of that information ?"
10362,474,agent_2,"i''m sure that it will give the players more game play time . sinmce the chips insid4e the footballs travk velocity , rotation , ball speed , an dlocation . that probably allows extra time for play since the coache s, and all the other measurememts that happen during footall games will be ore automated . tha should free up some more time ."
10363,474,agent_1,do you listen to the radio ?
10364,474,agent_2,"yes , everytime i get itno my ca ri do . i listen to pamdora tha tgives me all kinds of music depending on my mood and playlist . i've heard that you cxan evenl isften to old news programs o npevial stations . for instance , since 189 , a finnish radio station has broadcasted a ' nuntii latini ' program in classica latin ."
10365,474,agent_1,soldiers used to bui.d the mout of a pencil ajd razorblade .
10366,474,agent_2,"yes , i'd like to learnj how do that myself . spparently , you just use a razor blade and a penckl as a diode . i believr tht they were called foxhole radios ."
10367,474,agent_1,did you know that you can hear upiter radio songs on am radio ?
10368,474,agent_2,"well , i think it is radio storms that wre so strong that they can be pikced up andh eard on the azm radio ."
10369,474,agent_1,"iteresting , have you heard tehm ?"
10370,474,agent_2,"no , iv'e never heard anything like that . i did hear , though , that there's a website where you can listen to thousands of episodes of classic radio dramas cor free although i neverr had the pleqsure of doing so ."
10371,474,agent_1,"interesting , i'm not6 a huge fan of classic radio dramas ."
10372,474,agent_2,"me neither but i like to investigate ld school . old school is interesting . as a matter lof old school , did you know that the circualr huddle in football was created by paul d . hubbard , a desf bq , so the otehr team dould not read his hand sigals ? that's cool old school !"
10373,474,agent_1,"interesting , well , nice chatting with you !"
10374,474,agent_2,"you ws eell , have a good one ."
10375,475,agent_1,"hi , do you watch football"
10376,475,agent_2,"not really , just the halftime shows . i know joe namsth is stil lmy favorite qb though ."
10377,475,agent_1,he is mine too . i also like watching hlf time . haha
10378,475,agent_2,ih ear kellan moore is the sole lwf6hnaded qb in the nfl .
10379,475,agent_1,"yeah , that fact surprised me because i thought that therwe are at elast 2 left handed quarterbacks ."
10380,475,agent_2,"huh ? the huddle was develoed because of a deaf qb who had to useh and signals for plays , so the othwrs gathered aroujd him . i be.ieve it was a ntre dame . tehre was a ,ovie about it ."
10381,475,agent_1,"it sound a bit odd , but it works wonderfully so far ebcause it is the best way to avoid your dalls being eard by the other team"
10382,475,agent_2,i agree . i've heard the name ayfield but i think it's a bit early to say he's another favr eor elway .
10383,475,agent_1,i tyhink his potentila is there . but i am a touhc worried thath is attitude is like fre' s .
10384,475,agent_2,"well , the qb is the 'leader' od he offensive team . lots of entitlement goes with being tnhe 'leader' ."
10385,475,agent_1,exactly . being a uarterback of a nfl team is not an easy task at all . they must have leadership skill in addition to their football skill
10386,475,agent_2,"so , i've heard one qb threw a touch down pass and he threw it to himself ?"
10387,475,agent_1,"yeah , it was nick fole , the quarterbadk of philadelphia eagle in the super bowl last year"
10388,475,agent_2,wow ! i can't see radio being a good medium to follow a football game . you ?
10389,475,agent_1,"i agree with you there because it would be a very boring way to follow this game . btw , did you know that soldiers in wwii used only razorbkade and pencil to make a radio"
10390,475,agent_2,i heard that before somewhere . i wouldn't know how did you knowb ing crosby song filed more than haof the radio time for recorded music in 1948 ?
10391,475,agent_1,"for that fact , i have no clue whatso4vewr . btw , did you know that our am radio is able to pick up signal of a jupier radios tor m?"
10392,475,agent_2,no ! i do know there is a radio station that translates solar activity int so7nd which means you can listen to tyhe sun's music livew !
10393,475,agent_1,technology enables us to do so many fascinating things . and i hop3 that we will live on the moon in the near future . wha5 do you think
10394,475,agent_2,i don't know . i know nobody from the nflw ill be playing in that gravity though !

10408,476,agent_2,su5e if he keeps this contract he would have been with green bay for his entire career

10421,476,agent_1,"i bet that too , he is a really smart guy , also has a masterrs degree so maybe its related to ehgineering"

10489,480,agent_1,"it's doubtful , he doesn't have much experience"
10490,480,agent_2,driskel dis get two touch downs after comin gjnto the game .
10491,480,agent_1,i think tom savage will do a little better for them
10492,480,agent_2,driskel state that he's always known he could olay really wel; .
10493,480,agent_1,"true , he just doesn't have much experience , but having aj green back should help ."
10494,480,agent_2,the medical team sid they will likely get andy back at tue start of next season .
10495,480,agent_1,yea taht'd be great for him
10496,480,agent_2,aj green had been out with a toe injury as well .
10497,480,agent_1,"yes , he should be comihg back th9s week though"
10498,480,agent_2,the texans picked up dalton in 2014 when he was 28 years old .

10510,481,agent_1,"gor surs , he is a star in hte making . kellen moore nots o much lol . my favorite lefty 3asm ichael vick !"
10511,481,agent_2,"oh , yeah . i live in atl hwe nhe was happening . i can't believe an nfl qb would quit footbal lto go into video gaming , baker mayfield , ."
10512,481,agent_1,"right , i thihk he thought about quitting the sport to video game . i would have beat him in halo 3 tfhough one on obe ffr sure !"
10513,481,agent_2,ha . i guess there woudl be fewer injuries . i didn't know the nfl didn't have a rule against women playing .
10514,481,agent_1,"i didn't know that either , i think my ex girfrien dcould gave played . are you a fan of the saints ?"
10515,481,agent_2,i like drew brees . i played im hs and tfhere wads a lot of standing around but only 11 minutes of gamepaly ?
10516,481,agent_1,"right , what a waste of money to go to a ga,e lol . i heard the cheerleaders for the saints have to leave abywhere when the players come , kind of sexist i think"
10517,481,agent_2,doens't seem fair . i wonder if they track the cheerleaders with chips oiket ehy are putting in shoulder pads ?
10518,481,agent_1,i bet the do . they are probably made by engineers who make more money than players in their lifetime
10519,481,agent_2,i; man engineer and i ain't seeing it . . . i can't see hiw soldiers in ww i could make ar adio out of razor blades and penvils ? wow .
10520,481,agent_1,"lol , that traes pure zcience around that . i can't even get my already made rzdio to work !"
10521,481,agent_2,"ha . i would just end up cutting myeelf . i guess they may have tuned into jupiter , there probably weren't a ,t of station then ."
10522,481,agent_1,"ha for sure em too ! i heard amr adios can ick up thesi5 radio waves , that would be spooky !"
10523,481,agent_2,i tis made for sifi . . . canadian laws make their stations play 4 0pervne3t canadian music . do they have that much playalbe musi c?
10524,481,agent_1,"i don't think so lo; , the only canada music i know is biebera nd no thanks ! good chatting aith you !"

10531,482,agent_1,"yeah pretty smart . its tracks speed , locayion , rotation and some other sats ?"
10532,482,agent_2,i wonder what they use the data for
10533,482,agent_1,"i hwave no clue , maybe on how they could be faster , or throw better . thats my guess ."
10534,482,agent_2,i hope it goes ftowards reducing injuries leading to early retirememnt
10535,482,agent_1,yeah that would be a good idea too ! football players do encounter a lot of injuries .
10536,482,agent_2,"probably i the reason why considering av4rag elifetime eanrings , an engineer is pzid higher thuan players"
10537,482,agent_1,yeah t6hats craz ! in the 60's top bowlers earen more than football players lol

10572,484,agent_2,yes . did you know there is only 11 minutes of game play in a game ?
10573,484,agent_1,yes crazy since u talkeas forever for the game to ned with everythkng else in between
10574,484,agent_2,ysa hik no w. engineer smake more money than nfl 0layers over the lifetime
10575,484,agent_1,yes but i guess they havde longer careers too so maybe that is why
10576,484,agent_2,"yeah that is actuaslly a good po8nt , it maeks much more sense"
10577,484,agent_1,did you hea rabout that rule for new orleans hcrerleaders ?

10581,484,agent_1,yes i agree . did you know they are using chips on the players now ?
10582,484,agent_2,yes they are trackig velocity and speed adn all that stuff
10583,484,agent_1,i wonder if there is a way to use that data to make the game safer
10584,484,agent_2,i hope so too . do you like rap music ?
10585,484,agent_1,somewhat . i like the old stuff from like tupac and eminem
10586,484,agent_2,yes me oo . tupac's music is in the library of congress for cultural significance
10587,484,agent_1,yes . rid you know eminem wanted to eb a comic book artist ?
10588,484,agent_2,yes he seems to really like spiderman of all the superheroes
10589,484,agent_1,yeah but he sire did well with music too
10590,485,agent_1,i guess the nl protests have been a xource of contention for more than a year now thoug hyou don't hear a lot about it this season .
10591,485,agent_2,"i remembdr hearing about it at the start of the season , watching to ee it any teams or players , including my fantasy players , would stand or sit or kneel or whatever . i have kennyg stills and he took part in the protest , at least at the staet of the season ."
10592,485,agent_1,it is sad to me that so many completely misunderstand hwat the plauyers are trying to do . manyd isenters of their wctions used their peaceful attempt to bring injustice to ligh tas a false call for patriotic awareness .
10593,485,agent_2,it seems to me that the true purpose of the prot4st is lost . what is it about ? the concept of bail set pretrial ?
10594,485,agent_1,"it covers many areas in my view . overreach by law enforcement , inpro;portional handling of blacks by teh courts an many others . i am a product of the 60s and fully understand their frustrations"
10595,485,agent_2,"is theee a specific policy change sought , o5r do you thini iut's too complex for anyone to hope for a clear resolution ?"
10596,485,agent_1,"i think that they just want a comlete rezssessment of th4 criminal justice system . it is a situation that will not be solved by me but requires the efforts of a greatm any of us acting in concert . everyone ha stheir own views i suppose . like rap music , i abhor it bu am greatly outnumbered by fans ."
10597,485,agent_2,"well , taht seems too nebulpus and abstract for us to expect any resolutiona nytime in the near future . and i think if that's what they're really after , standing for a minute before a football gme is not enough to kmove ot alonb ,. i feel otnumbered too , but its' really hard to fight for a causew ithout a specific goal ."
10598,485,agent_1,"yes it is , and the problem is exasperated along radia ldivides . minorities are more apt go react with distrust . i have never udnwerstood why the anthem is played before a sporting wvent anyway . even when i was a boy i thought that it diminishes it's message ."
10599,485,agent_2,"i don't like the proposed solutions within the nfl , with nonbindingv o3s and waived fines and such . it seems messy . whe nelse do we sing the national anthem in ghe us ? i cna only tghink of presidential debates . when do you think is appropriate ?"
10600,485,agent_1,i agree that the nfl lacks approriate leadership in this area ?. if they had taken a f9rm stand either way it would have had an eff4ct on the rotests . i think that the anthem should be reserved for government functiosn only and that the pledge of allieence should be limited to those taking office .
10601,485,agent_2,i would disagree . the anthem and the pledge are important ways we as a people build our cultural ident6ity . it should be a source of unity in our diversity . do you think national identity and unity are important ?
10602,485,agent_1,"i do . but is that national identity to be forcede onto us by reciting a sxript of words or is the realization of individual rights more important ? are we a country that subscribes to those rights or are w a nation of mindless followers ? sorry , i don't mean to preach ,"
10603,485,agent_2,"no offense taken . ideally , the lyrics and the script should reflect the rigths weh kld in common . i'm crious , which words or phrases do you think are inappropriate ? are there any that relate to the core of the protests , abo8t bail or law enforcement disparities ?"
10604,485,agent_1,"from the constitution : all men are created ewual . that is a statement that has been shoved aside too many times . mijnorites , the poor or disadvantaged are prposely overloloked by many in our governmnet ."
10605,485,agent_2,agreed . but isn'5t that a reason to better emphasize and adhere tot hings like the pledge ? ' . . . with liberty and justice for all ' . or the anthem : ' t5he land of the rfree ' .
10606,485,agent_1,"only if those same words are bel9eved in and adhered to by everyone , including those in power . however we have digressed from the football subject by a hugye amount . do you have a favorite for the super bowl ."
10607,485,agent_2,"hahaha . i like talking about subjects of weight more than a nonsequetnial party . i agree , and i would postulate that a better protdst ould be to raise the volume and put action behidn ' land of thef ree ' would be more educational and effective . i enjoyed , in retrospect , when brady beat the falcons z few years back ."
10608,485,agent_1,"i would agree but i hate the pats ,t oom uchd rama an accusations . i think his year i'm hoping for the saints ."
10609,485,agent_2,oh i hate tehm too . . . brady and all . i thogbt it was impressive for the pats and sad for the falcons . i like mat6 ryan and i love drew brees ! i guess i love qbs
10610,485,agent_1,my fav is russel wils9nb ut i live in wa state . my friend i havd thoroughly enjoyed chatting wiht you . it is a great pleasure to find soeone who can spar verbally with ikntelligence and insight . kudos to you !
10611,485,agent_2,likewise . i enjoyed it as well . i'm going to go watch some bowling to calm down npw .
10612,485,agent_1,haha . i'?ll take a walk .
10613,485,agent_2,good deal .
10614,486,agent_1,"huh , that's interesting ! your thoughts ?"
10615,486,agent_2,"hello , how are you ? did you know the nfl has no written rule against female playesrs ; women wou.d in fact he allowed if they met the leaguw's eligibility requirements ."
10616,486,agent_1,an averag enfl game only has 11 minutes of live gamepaly
10617,486,agent_2,thats so weird considsr8ng an game can go for 34 hours .
10618,486,agent_1,the average lifetime earnigns of an enineer is higher than teh average ljfetime earnings o fna nfl playrr and an average ml bplayer .
10619,486,agent_2,"yeah thats so surprising ! new orleans saints cheerleaders are forbidden from eating in he same restaurant as any nfl player wnd i fthe7 are alreacy dining at a restaurant and a nnfl player comes in after , the cheerleaders are required to leave ."
10620,486,agent_1,"kinda sexist . . . nfl uses trzckingc hips embedded ih playere shoulder pad sto record a players every mov eon the field . they are also located inside footballs to track : velocity , rotation ,m ball speed and location ."
10621,486,agent_2,"thats really itneresting ! before he became a rapper , eminem's true dream was to become a comic"
10622,486,agent_1,hah a! nothing exudes coemdy like eminem !
10623,486,agent_2,in 2001 a michigan judge delivered her ruling in the form of a rap when trying as uit filed against rapper eminem
10624,486,agent_1,"korean rappers invented a hew tpe of freestyle , it's called ' complimnet bzttle ' ."
10625,486,agent_2,"that makes sense . koreans have so much rules with music , they cant sing about anything negative and for awhile they had to hav esongs aboutf their countryl ol"
10626,486,agent_1,seems strange thatt he university of oowa's locker room for isiting football teans is completely painted pink
10627,486,agent_2,"yeah , must be something kibnd of strategy ."
10628,486,agent_1,"the highest score ever in a football game occurred in 1916 when georgia tecb defeated cumberland 2220 . you gotta pul the qb , right ?"
10629,486,agent_2,thats huge sckore ! former partiots rb benjarvus greenellis hasw never fumbeld the football in his nfl career .
10630,486,agent_1,espn won an emmy for the creation of the superimposed gellow line representing the first down line fora merican football games .
10631,486,agent_2,good for them !
10632,486,agent_1,same with bowlers . . . in the 1960' estop bowlers made twice as much as top footbal stars
10633,486,agent_2,that's seesm unfair o football players lol
10634,486,agent_1,nice speaking with you
10635,487,agent_1,hi ! do you follow football ?
10636,487,agent_2,"sorry , i can't say that5 i do , i'm familiar with the bi stoeries , butt hat is i t."
10637,487,agent_1,"that is about how uch i knoe , just the basics , and some rfun trivia ."
10638,487,agent_2,"i used tol ive in dc son kind of know the redskins , but alex smith is new t me , is he the quarterback ?"
10639,487,agent_1,"yes . he took so many ap classes in high school he entered college as a jun8or , he started working on a masters then ."
10640,487,agent_2,"now that is impressive , you have this impression of sports players as jocks , bu rhe transcends that stereo5ype ."
10641,487,agent_1,"he reallyd oes , he was drafteda s a number one pick in 200 5too ."
10642,487,agent_2,do you go to football games ? i've been to one once in my life at inediana university .
10643,487,agent_1,"ive been to quite a few at flofida state , but no pro games . there is only 11 minutes of live action anyway"
10644,487,agent_2,"i think that is what puts me off , i really don't hafe time to sit in front of the tv for three hours , nad then for on,y 11 minutes of play ."
10645,487,agent_1,"i is hard to find time fopr that , i dont know how some people do it all day , on a weekly basis ."
10646,487,agent_2,"i guess some eople listen to games on the radio , difficult to see how that works ."
10647,487,agent_1,"ive done it traveling , youve got to really know te tea mand all of th3 players names . it was so much harder ."
10648,487,agent_2,"do you have a favorite nfo team . like i said , i lived in dc for aw hile so kinmd of follow them . now oin northern ohio , the browns are ad ifficult team to support ."
10649,487,agent_1,"i feel you there , living in florida here . dolphins are hard to root for and feel proud ."
10650,487,agent_2,"it coul be worse , i rezd about this team that lost 2200 . it wuld be hard to0 qatch to the edn ."
10651,487,agent_1,taht would be really hard . ga tech sure did dominate that game .
10652,487,agent_2,"they probably have some plaque in t3h locker rdoom t commemorate it . i hear onet eam paints th eopponents locker room pink k, semes a little childish to me ."
10653,487,agent_1,"it does , plus it is that kind of toxic behavior that makes simpl ethings like colorsb ad ."
10654,487,agent_2,"the money these pro players get now is huge , funny to think pro bowlers made more thamn footballers back in the sixties ."
10655,487,agent_1,thats wild . i womer wat the pay was back then ?
10656,487,agent_2,probably not much for either of them .
10657,487,agent_1,"yeah , nothing like it is today . way toom uch imo"
10658,487,agent_2,"nice cahtting with you ,h ave a good evening ."
10659,488,agent_1,"hello , lets talk about football . there is a locvker room at the university of iowa painted pink"
10660,488,agent_2,that is weird . do you happen to know why that is ?
10661,488,agent_1,"that locker room is ujsed for visiting teams , maybe i twas done to play with hteir mind bsfore a game ."
10662,488,agent_2,ha ! thatf could be it . they probbly did to throw teh v8siting team off their game ;. that makes perfect sense .
10663,488,agent_1,back in the 1960's football stars used to make less money then owlers .
10664,488,agent_2,"wow ! 12 i didn't know this but i bet that is not the case these day s, football players make way more than bowlers no w, righ t?"
10665,488,agent_1,i would think so . the creation of teh yello wfirst down line won espn adn emmy
10666,488,agent_2,that is very nice . i think this emmyw as wel ldeserved because people could see where the actual first down was because before it was a guessingg ame .
10667,488,agent_1,"georgia tech hold the record for highest scoring game inj 1916 , they wom with a score of 222"
10668,488,agent_2,"wow ! ! ! who did they beat up that badly , do you know ?"
10669,488,agent_1,"yds they were up against cumberland who ebded the ga,e with a score of 0"
10670,488,agent_2,"tha 5is too bad for them , i guess cumberland just made an appearance to the field that particular day . ha hq ! ! !"
10671,488,agent_1,lets tal kabout radio n3xt . there are radio storms so strong j upiter tat then can be heard on am radio .
10672,488,agent_2,tha tis a very interesting . thanks . did you know that radio systems need an antenna to convert eleftric currents into radio waves ?
10673,488,agent_1,"i did not , if you want ti listen to old classic radio dramas , there is a website dedicated to that ."
10674,488,agent_2,thanke . do you happen to knowt he name of the website hat does this ?
10675,488,agent_1,i o not . bck in ww2 soldiers made radios out of razor blades and a pencil .

10677,488,agent_1,in caand athey have a law that all radios must play at least 40 percent cnaadian music .
10678,488,agent_2,i didn't know this . thanks . did you know that a radio receiver receives its input frok an antenbna and the4n it converts it into a form that is usable for the cnsumer ?
10679,488,agent_1,interesting . there is a weekly radio broadcast in finland that is conducted entirely in classical latin . it was njce talking to yoy toxay .
10680,489,agent_1,"hi , how are you tonight ? are you interested in football ?"
10681,489,agent_2,"hey tere i do like football . if you want into a locker room and it was painted pink , would that make you play better or worse ?"
10682,489,agent_1,it would make me angry and play harder to show the othsr team htat their littl etrick hadnt' work . i ain't no pacifist ! grrr !
10683,489,agent_2,haha i'm with you there . i can't believe the university of iowa did that to the opposing tdam lol . have you efer gone bowling by the way ?
10684,489,agent_1,"i think other teams would hae adopted the same tactic i fit worked . i have gone bowling , not recently . not really my thing . how about you ?"
10685,489,agent_2,"yeah i'veg one bowling ebfore its' crazy that bowlers ion the 60s made more ythan top footbal stars , oh how thes times have cahnged"
10686,489,agent_1,the bowlers were pa4t of an establisheds port . pro football was just getting going . the college game was loved l but didcn't pay . so i'm not surprised .
10687,489,agent_2,ye0p i ahgree with you . hav you heard ov the highest scoring football game ever ? it was with georgia tech and cumberland ?
10688,489,agent_1,tha twas a ridiculous blowout . tha game should never have been schedule . gt was too powerful .
10689,489,agent_2,yep i agree with you . it was drefinitely a mismatch .d o you ever watch football o nthe television ? i guesw espn created the yellow line tha hsows first downs
10690,489,agent_1,"that yel.low line seems so obvious , but i guess nobody figured out a way to do it . there are lots of graphics that could be superimposed on the field to make the game more interesting ."
10691,489,agent_2,yep i agree with you . it's crazy that they qon an emmy for that too lol it seems so obvious
10692,489,agent_1,"a naward for a line . next , u of iow awill 3in ror a pink line on the field ."
10693,489,agent_2,haha anything is possible . what are your thouhgt son the patriots ? do you know that one of them has never fumbled the ball ? i think he doesn't play anymore though but that is stll impressive
10694,489,agent_1,how is that possible ? tje guy must have a special technique . i hope that he got some kind of bonus for that featy . he's incredible !
10695,489,agent_2,that is incredible ! whatd o you think about the radio by the way ? do you ever listen to it ? i know that i always listen to outube instead
10696,489,agent_1,"i used to listen to the radio as a kid , not so much now . i go to youtube for thec lassics that i want to hear . radi is good for a commute ."
10697,489,agent_2,"have you efer listened to the radio from jupiter ?. apparently you can pick it up on your am radio in the car , i'll have to tr5y that next time"
10698,489,agent_1,"the storms on jupiter are pfobably better than a lot oft hings on the radio . like news broadcasts in latin , for instance ."
10699,489,agent_2,haha that's what i was thinking too . o5 canadian radio for that matter . you need at least 40 percemt of the radio in canada to be of canadjan origin . i can't think of any good cnaadian artists off the top of my ead
10700,489,agent_1,"rush , aprip wine , vryan adams , neil young are a few popular ones . then theres' bieber . hgm ."
10701,489,agent_2,ok i'll give you r4ush on that one haha . would you ever listen to a classic radio drama though ? theres' a website that has a bunch of them folr free
10702,490,agent_1,"hell.o , are you a football fan . did you know that the visitors locker room is pink at the university of iowa ."
10703,490,agent_2,"well i love pro ball , not so interested in college , it's too emotional from players ."
10704,490,agent_1,"in the 1960's , the top bowlers earner twice as muc has the top football stars ."
10705,490,agent_2,i believe that . football was just beginning to become popular . it the two leagues hadn't consolidated it might have remained at that level .
10706,490,agent_1,"really , that is cool . georgia tech beat cmberland 222 . 0 in the highest scoring game ever ."
10707,490,agent_2,must have not had a defensive coordinator back then . you havw af avorite team ?
10708,490,agent_1,"i like the carolina panthers , i'm a nc man , . tom brady was either bad in hs o rhis coach didn't notice him . he was a backup quarterback and even though his team was having a historically bad season , he couldn't get a start ."
10709,490,agent_2,"i have had several different teams through the years ? i was an avid raiders fan until they moved to la , now i root fort he seahawks since i'm from wa ."
10710,490,agent_1,seahawks are cool . i am a russell wilon fan . he went to nc state the fi4st 3 years . i went there . did you know that there is only 1 left handed quarterback in the nfl . it is kellan moore .
10711,490,agent_2,i wonder if b4ing lefthanded is an asset or a hinderance . i think that kenny stabler was also a elftie but that was long ago .
10712,490,agent_1,i think i remember him . a coo.f act is thatt he circular huddle used today is because of paul d . hubbard . he was a deaf quarterabck and they sgarted huddling that way so the defense could not see his hand zignals .
10713,490,agent_2,"i ha dheard that . i sonder how he handled the snapxs ? maybes just touched the center . how about alex smith , bot only a great qb hut also fery smart ."
10714,490,agent_1,7es he eas . i think he tokok enough ap tests in high school toe nter college as a junior .
10715,490,agent_2,"amazing man . did you play fb in school ? i was raised in fairbanks ak and the snpw didn't totally disappear until may 1s t, school let out mid may so it would have been a very short season ."
10716,490,agent_1,"no , i played basketball . going back to alex smith ,h e alsob egan working on his master's degree before he became the first pick in rhe 2005 nfl draft ."
10717,490,agent_2,"hope he foinishes it . while it might not pay as much , education is the best thing you can have ."
10718,490,agent_1,"yes , that is true . the quarterback for the university of oklahoma , baker mayfield , considered quotting football to become a fu.ltime competitive gamer ."
10719,490,agent_2,on eof my son swanted to be a game coder but he ended jp being an it specialist . you have a pick for the super bowl yet ?
10720,490,agent_1,he clamsh e can beat anyone at the univrersity of okalhoam one on one in halo 3 . i never played gmaes like that .

10730,491,agent_2,"il ive in dc and joshn orman is dislike d, it's a fommon opinion that all he does is talk and not play well"
10731,491,agent_1,"lol . well you might be a little biased , you can't support both the redksins and eagles can you ?"
10732,491,agent_2,"i only support teh eaglew , jusy ther edskins arre the local team so we get a ton of news about the daily . its kind of ljie a circus lol"

10740,491,agent_2,"yes that is amazing , was also shocked when i read that"
10741,491,agent_1,i guess i find all of it fascinating . how did someone fgure ouf that these waves could be converted into sound ?

10748,492,agent_1,"i'm not sure . i don't think it would bother me , if anything it wou dbe an impetus to beat the other team bad ."
10749,492,agent_2,i agree . did you knowk ella nmoore is the only left handed qb in the nfl ?
10750,492,agent_1,"i did know thart , but i'm unsure why he is the only oen ."

10755,492,agent_2,tha'ts a huge defeat . i remember tat one too .
10756,492,agent_1,that was the game where i think there were like 5 touvhdowns in one quarter .

10758,492,agent_1,interesrting . i'mn otf amiliar with him . is he any good ?
10759,492,agent_2,he is very goosd . dod you know snoop dogg wrote a fight song fo rhi son's high school football team ?

10770,493,agent_2,"i did , the patriots did a good job . tom brady ha scame a long way from his jv days at junipero serra high school . he wasn't even a starter bavck then ."
10771,493,agent_1,tom beady is undeniable one of the greatest quartbacks ghe league has had i nrecnt times i wish the game would have been more exciting though
10772,493,agent_2,yeah it was pretth boring . atleast it wasn't a complere blow out like georgia tech di to cumberland in 1816 . they won 2220 !
10773,493,agent_1,imagine watching that ij would have left after the first hourw hen it hit 700 i wul dstand up and get the car started lol
10774,493,agent_2,"yeh , that's alo of scorijg . i bet the quarterabck di dalot of work in that game ."
10775,493,agent_1,they prbably had every p;ayer on the team be quarterback at least for one ply
10776,493,agent_2,they probably did . did you know that the cirvcular huddle was created by a deaf quarterback ?
10777,493,agent_1,well htatd eaf quartback changed history because his technique is still used in modern times
10778,493,agent_2,yeah he did . alex smith is another smart quarterback . he entered college as a junior because he took so may p test in high school .
10779,493,agent_1,i actually never knew thay with a strong mind like that he was probably really good at making plays
10780,493,agent_2,he probably is . 9t takes a strong mind as well as a strong arm to be a good quarterback .
10781,493,agent_1,a mind like john madden and an arm like peyton manning
10782,493,agent_2,that' sright ! i heard that baker mayfield almost qui footblal to pursue fulltime competitigve game .
10783,493,agent_1,hopefully he could become awewome at gaming so he could show he is multi talented
10784,493,agent_2,he does csim he cold beat anyone at oklhaoma at halo 3 .

10791,494,agent_2,"yes , that is teh toughest posi6ion . he touches the ball on every play . it must be tough . especially the ph7sical punishment ."
10792,494,agent_1,"not only that , but rthey're pretty mch seen as the leader of thew hole offensive team ."
10793,494,agent_2,i guess the coach has to choose the qbg carefully . a player that understands what the coach is trying to achieve . who is your favorite qb ?
10794,494,agent_1,"i don't have a favorite , but i really don't like tom brady . even thuough he's supposedly pretty good ."
10795,494,agent_2,"h is good , but i probably woujld like to see some othe5 qbs get to ein the sb . i usually root for the underdog ."
10796,494,agent_1,"yeah , he's definitely been to his fair share pf super bow,s . he nust plan his februarys around it !"

10800,494,agent_1,who knows . they just used ar azorblade ad a pencil !
10801,494,agent_2,that is amazing ! i guess they were able to get instructions or listen to the enemy . maybe they listened to storms on jupiter ?
10802,494,agent_1,"if they were in canada , the probability of them listneing to a canadian artist would be pretty high ."
10803,494,agent_2,"yeha , theyw ould ne stuck listening to rush . cant be uelped ! ol would you listen to old radio dramas ?"
10804,494,agent_1,"maybe , bgut i'd lrefer to listen to sports trivia . did you know the former patriots running back never fumbled the ball in his entire career ?"
10805,494,agent_2,that is amazing ! i wonder if he got a bonus for that . that is quite a feat .
10806,494,agent_1,"who know s? but i should probably qrap up this conversation . thanmks for the chat about football and the radio ! next time to see a huddle , thank paul hubbard for that !"
10807,494,agent_2,"paiul hybbard was a legend , an innovator ! yes , great chat !"

10814,495,agent_2,"yep . i think i'd rather be a competitive gamer like baker mayfield thoughta nout , though i don't play halo"
10815,495,agent_1,ui actually had beag him in a tourney a couple years back when he was in college
10816,495,agent_2,really ? that must have been cool . so you play halo ? o a xifferent game ?

10845,496,agent_2,perhaps it is to mentally perturb the opposing team or keep them off balance ?
10846,496,agent_1,that could be i just think it is funny
10847,496,agent_2,"who knows ? in any case , it culd be that they just wanted something that stoo out"
10848,496,agent_1,yep football hustory has a lot of interesting facts like espn won ane mmy for the creation of the sup3erimposed yellow lkine representing the first down line for american fokotball games

10882,498,agent_2,"oh wow , i've also attended a game at ut bfore but i hacve never been to the high school stadium that seats 18 , p0o people an dcost 60 million to build . no , i didn't know that , why do they paint it pink ?"
10883,498,agent_1,"not s8re , but i guess it's aort of influence on minds . but i would google it after hit . i'm really wondering . let's change topi . i've read some info about radio ahd found quite interesting that in canada 40 percent of music played shou.d be canadian . i didn't know wha6 this rule . hav you eve rbeen in canada ?"
10884,498,agent_2,"yeah , maybe to intimidatr them perhaps . i ve never been to canada but i have banff on jy bucket list . how do radio stations montor whether or ot the radio stationms actually uph9ld to thwt ?"
10885,498,agent_1,i'm sure there is special govsrnment agency or something like this lol i honestly listen radio only ih my car .
10886,498,agent_2,"yeah , i thijk that's ythe only time i'm exposed to the radio though there s a radio station that translates solar activity into sound for people to listen to the sun's music , i have yet to come across this station ."
10887,498,agent_1,"did you know that there is a website , whicu contains episodes of claseic radio dramas for free ? i'm wondering to fidn this 2ebsite ."
10888,498,agent_2,what exactly are radio dramas ? are those considered podcasts ?
10889,498,agent_1,"not sure . i guess it's like theater perf05mance , but played in radio . t was popular some dozens yearsa go , hbut of coursen ot in youtube ofr netflix time like no ."
10890,498,agent_2,"oh ok , i rely on podcasts for some lojng commutes . i had no idea bingv rosby was so popular on the rado back then , he filled more than half or the radio time ib 1948 !"
10891,498,agent_1,"really ? i didn't know . yea , radio was popular wt this time . i know sopldiers inw wii really apprciated when thdy had an opportunity to listen radio ."
10892,498,agent_2,"oh yeah , i bet tha twas their only source of enteftainment back then ! they even had ventriloquists on radiosa nd it was a very popular radio act , that's talent !"
10893,498,agent_1,true . ok . it was nice to meet you and chat here in this hit . nave a good fay !
10894,498,agent_2,"yes , have a good day !"
10895,499,agent_1,hey thered o you watch the nfl ? it stands for the national football league btw
10896,499,agent_2,"i do , i follow it pretty clpsely , what about you ?"
10897,499,agent_1,"if ollow it sometimes , id id watch th4e super bowl which i found a litle bit boring , but i do likd the patriots i'm glad they won , wha about you ;"
10898,499,agent_2,"not a patriots fan , but yeqh , the dsuperbowl was super boring this year ."
10899,499,agent_1,"yes i agree . i wonder if it's becfause then average nfl game only has 11 minutes of gameplay to it . the rest is commercasl , and referees and such"
10900,499,agent_2,"yeah , that could be a big part o fit . they do always seem to be standing around ."
10901,499,agent_1,yep that's true . would you watch the nfl if it had fsmale players ? ap0arently there's np rule against it
10902,499,agent_2,i don't know if people want to see female players .
10903,499,agent_1,"yeah i don't know !t hey woul dhave to be very athletic too l oh , what i don't like is how rhe new orleans saints treat their hceereladers tough , did you hear about trhat ?"
10904,499,agent_2,"yeah , a lot of tesm actually have tat rule . the redskins do too , i know because i have a few friends who cheered for them a few years back ."
10905,499,agent_1,"o hinteresting , how did tehy like being ch4erleaders by thye way , and that's interestign taht he redskins ave that rule too , i wonder if all the teams do"
10906,499,agent_2,"they don't get paid well and it is a lot of work . the ru,e is actually no fraternizing , but chris cooley , a player , at the time ended up marrying one and it created a big stink fv9r the other cheerleaders . lol"
10907,499,agent_1,"lol that's funny . i can see i guess why they have that rule fhough . what do you think about pink locker rooms by thew ay ? apparently the university of iowa di that to the opposing team's locker roo,"
10908,499,agent_2,"i think it is hilarious that they do thaf to guedt teamd , buy i'mn ot so sure it bothrs the other teasm ."
10909,499,agent_1,"i know right . i wonder if they cexck their einloss re3cord before and after they did that , in terms of how different iu6 would be lol o rif it mads no difference at all . i co think it's funnyt o that bowlers used to mkae more tha nfootball players back in the 60s"
10910,499,agent_2,i qonder how popular bowling was way back in the day ;
10911,499,agent_1,"yes i wonder , eelecially becauses howsl ike the flintstones would use it , maybe it was super popular ? also , they didn't hzve things like the superimposed yellow lne , i know that the espn came out with thzat and won an emmy , i dn't think that was back in the 60s though"
10912,499,agent_2,theyd eserve the emmy for that . it is pretty cool . i wonder if zny football players became bowl4ers in the 60s ?
10913,499,agent_1,"that's a good question , i wonder how amny good football players we lost to bokw.ers because they would be paid more lol , what do you think about dogs by the way ? do you have one ?"
10914,499,agent_2,i heard that dogs and elephants are the only animalst hat instinctively understand pointing .
10915,499,agent_1,"isn't that interesting question mark youd' think that would include other animals like gorillas or dolphins or somdthing , but apparenlty yes oly doge and elephnats , i also like htat google prefers dogs over cats lol htey put it int heir code of conduct , i agr3ee with them"
10916,500,agent_1,have you heard about the ;pictures of odell beckham doing cocaine ?
10917,500,agent_2,"not the pictures , but thrre's bee na lot of isappointment in general . people seem pr3tty angry ."
10918,500,agent_1,yes cris carter is definitely mad at him and callinyg him stupid .
10919,500,agent_2,"i mean , he's not wrong . when you are that highly paid , the highes tpaid r3eiver in history , you czan forego a few years of partying to secure a long term fture ."
10920,500,agent_1,exactly especially since it could get him kicked out of the league . your image in sports matters . i agree with carter on this oen .
10921,500,agent_2,"it does allude to th idea that carter is trying to get him to grow p and own up to the actions , so that he nmight not lose that spot , that's important . people can be sorry ."
10922,500,agent_1,he comparecd beckha to lawrence taylor a famous player who battled drugs .
10923,500,agent_2,"i feel ,ike gettng caught with cocaine and having a big drug and alcohol roblem is weird , but maybe beckham is gping down that path . it's a slippery slope ."
10924,500,agent_1,absolutely he is in line to mak up to 80 million over 5 years but he needxs to be more mature both during the games and off field .
10925,500,agent_2,"it does seem liek a big boys club of letting yong men not be eresponsible for their acti8ons bcause they ' do the sports really good' , and i am glad peopl eare syarting to cdall htem out for it , and willing to cut good players loose ."
10926,500,agent_1,i agree they are role modwels for the kids . tfhe nfl is a professional elague andt he super howl championship game in februwary gets crazy amounts of viewers .
10927,500,agent_2,"that's true . and the fl is doing a lot to improve it's image ont reatment of player s, the tracking chips in the shoulders and th efootbsll robably helps lessen injuries by seeing how players actually move . so hte players need to step up to that nerw era ."
10928,500,agent_1,for sure . teh game has only 11 minutes of actual gmaeplay but there are a lot of injuries .
10929,500,agent_2,"most csrtainly . especially head ones , stemming from eaelier verwions of the game that were just as ough liek rugby . back when there waw n0 real protective anyhting ."
10930,500,agent_1,absolutely there is a reason the lifetime earnings of an engineer is higher than that of a nfl player their career is a lot longer .
10931,500,agent_2,"it's funny to think that back in thr1 960s , blowelrs were paid more . i can't imsgine sitting around an dwatching bowlign being more exciting , buft nbowling alleuys were popular ."
10932,500,agent_1,"yeah i do love bowling though its been a while since i did it . there arem ore female bowlers thouhg even though i tis allowed for women fo play in th enfl , therte aren;t sny ."
10933,500,agent_2,"i wonder if woken will meet the 'standard' , if they did apply . i mean , new orleans ven mkaes heerleaders leave a restaurant if football players are there , sexism at its finest ."
10934,500,agent_1,"no kjdding 12 so maybde new orleans won't have a female kicker , but other teams might . locker rooms migb tbe an iss7e however ."
10935,500,agent_2,"probably true , but maybe we'll see a future ahen it's not lke that , adn women aren't treated like second class people in the world of football . that would probably help the 'boys club' image ."
10936,500,agent_1,esd like how the university o fiowa paints the visitihg teams locker room pink .
10937,501,agent_1,"hik there ! so i was reading about pokemon and i guess 5here are over7 50 episodes . that's about 50 a year , for 16 years straight !"
10938,501,agent_2,are you a pokemon fan ? i have never seen the show . if ogure its for kids . i i t?
10939,501,agent_1,"i'm not so much fqan , i was actually reading abou ttelevisions , since i just recently broke mine . but my youngest brother used to love that show , so i would do the pikachu voice for him . , hte little yellow hcaracter , hat i think is most popular , ."
10940,501,agent_2,isnt that show japanese or something ?
10941,501,agent_1,"speaking of foreign tv , i heard that 70's show was reamde vwrbatim in the uk , and called ' days like these ? and was cancelled after 10 episodes . i wonder why ? did they not have the same kind of 70's as we had here ?"
10942,501,agent_2,why would they do something so stupid as that ? verbatim ? likw thatr would fool anyone .
10943,501,agent_1,"i'm not sure what they where trying to do there . so i just found out that new york's area code is 212 because it was the fastest number to dial on a rotary phone . i didn't even know new york's area cfode adn now i learned a fun fact ! : ,"
10944,501,agent_2,have you eve rused a rotary phone ? very slow . the new yorkers got lucky .
10945,501,agent_1,"yes i have used a fotary phone ! makes me feel so odl , haha . but good times , for sure . oh wow , tuis is more if a weird fact , than a fun fact but apparently it's impossible to separat e2 phone books thst simply have teir pages overlapped together ! whzat not that i have a phone book b7t i'd like to test that to make sure !"
10946,501,agent_2,"it is a useless fact except maybe for a br bet . i guess you could win a drink , i used a rotary phone too ."
10947,501,agent_1,"i have a sort of useful fact about phones ! the cables carr6ying phone and intednet dqta across oceans are only 2 . 7 iches in diameter and just lay on the ocena floor ! that doesnj't sound very reliable , but seems tp bew orkkgn ."
10948,501,agent_2,i think that it is probably pretty sturdy . plus it is way down on the bottom of the sea . nothing lives there except maybe tiny creatures .
10949,501,agent_1,"hm , another probably notsointeresting fact , an iphone has nore computing power thajn the entire us nyclear icbm deterrent . do you have an iphone ?"
10950,501,agent_2,no i dont . coincdentally i do have an icbm deterrent .
10951,501,agent_1,"haha ! i don't have an iphone either . too expensive for my tste , or wallet , !"
10952,501,agent_2,"too expensive . the ifbm deterrent has text messaging ,w hich is good enugh for me ."
10953,501,agent_1,"aparently , unicef will donate a day of clean water to a child n need for every minute you dn't use your cell phon e. hm , i wonder whatt heir aim is there . nd i wonder why they don't just donate wvery child i need , clean drrinking water . or simply what is gon gon there ? !"
10954,501,agent_2,raising awarenes si guess . its not just the problem and the solution but getting people to think about others around the p.anet . and how much time they spend on those phonees .
10955,501,agent_1,"yeah , i see your point . i usually keep my phone turned off , which rnders it pretty useless most of the time . but it feels good to me ! plus i'm sick of all rhose spam calls or whatever the kids are calling them ."
10956,501,agent_2,"yeah , i guess those all the time . irritating . anyway , great chat !"
10957,501,agent_1,"yeah , it was great hcatting with ya !"
10958,502,agent_1,do you liie football ?'
10959,502,agent_2,i lie the nfl k but i think 16 games is not enough to build rivalries .
10960,502,agent_1,"yes , i completely agree ! what do you think would be a good number of games for an nfl team to play in a season ?"
10961,502,agent_2,"i don't know , there are 32 teams , so a least 32 games so they have played against each other zt least once before the playoffs ."
10962,502,agent_1,"i think that would be a bit much , you wouldn't have any players left because of all the injuries ."
10963,502,agent_2,"itg i quite a rough sport ,m ayb eif they had 2 roosters , but i don't see teh poin tof having 2d ifferetn lineup for 1 team .j ust make 2 diffrent tsams ."
10964,502,agent_1,exactly ! did you know htat tehre is only 11 minutes of live gameplay in a game ?
10965,502,agent_2,"yeah , i thmk you ened really good clmmentators with good eeplays to fill the rest . that why i prefer watching other things on tv ."
10966,502,agent_1,oh yeah . . . waht ohter things do you watch on television ?
10967,502,agent_2,"i likes funny cartoons like ' the simpsons ' , but i never saw ht eepisode where bart never appears or is referenced ."
10968,502,agent_1,oh i love the simpsons . . . yeah i wonder what episode that is ?
10969,502,agent_2,"wih i knew . . but therea re also really boring stuff on tv , like th uk remake of 7s0 show that only had 10 episodes , t ms have been dreadful ."
10970,502,agent_1,yeah . . . well the uks sense of humot isd ifferent than ours . watch teh uk version of ' the office ' and you will see
10971,502,agent_2,"did you liked i t? som eforeign shows have success in the states , like pokemon , they have over 750 episodes .,"
10972,502,agent_1,"it's ok , not a big fan of the office . that's a lot of episodes . where do they find the time ?"
10973,502,agent_2,i think i is more a standardized system like how t6ne builtc ar than an artistic procees fueled by onspiration . dp you like south park ? they produce a lot of episodes too .
10974,502,agent_1,south park is really fvunny ! did you se ethe simpsons crew sent the south park crew flowesrs on the fina lepisode of family guy !
10975,502,agent_2,"yeah , they criticized their humor as totally random and could be done by manatees . it was somewhat justified , but i also like this kind of humor ."
10976,502,agent_1,never really watched family guy ! you ever seen thomas the tank ?
10977,502,agent_2,"i saw itf rom time to time when i scan the chanels , i did not know thzt they hired stars , like ringo stars , to narrate it ."
10978,502,agent_1,great chatting with you !
10979,503,agent_1,hi there . i think our phones are taken fo rgranted . back in the day they didn't even have wireless phones .
10980,503,agent_2,have you ever used a rotary phone ? i have . i am very old . two days older than dirt . lol
10981,503,agent_1,yes i have ! kid of slow but not for new3 yorkers who hadc the most efficient area code !
10982,503,agent_2,"yeah , the new yorlers got lucky . i bet folks in alaska adn hawaii got thes low ones ."
10983,503,agent_1,yeah good guees ! did you know teh iphone has more computing power then the entire us nuclezr icbm dterrent ?
10984,503,agent_2,"yes , and 5the iphone is much better at text messaging too ."
10985,503,agent_1,yes it is . much better than the old rotary phones . unicef aill donate a day of clean water to a child in nee dfor every minut eyou doj't use your phnone .b ut i'm not sure how to enroll i nthis program .
10986,503,agent_2,"neither am i . i figure that there is a web site , bur people really are addicted to their phones . i wonder how much water gets donated ."
10987,503,agent_1,yes people really are . hopefully a lot of water . the cables carrying phone and internet data across oceans are only 2 . 7 inches in diameter . that is hard to believe .
10988,503,agent_2,i think it is a bundle of fiberoptikc cables . each thread carries a ton of signals . i wonder how they fix it when there is a problem .
10989,503,agent_1,yes i would not want to be the electrical engineer on duty . they simply judt lay across the ocean floor .
10990,503,agent_2,"i guess they have to send down a probe , or something lik ethat . probably not a lot of life dont there though ."
10991,503,agent_1,yeah htat's probably a good guess . appa5ently it is impossinle to separate two phonebooks that simply have their pages overlapped together . i don't plan on trying .
10992,503,agent_2,phone books ? does anyone have those things any more ? do you watch tv thes edays ?
10993,503,agent_1,i definitely don't . i enjoy t v. i can't believe tv only used to be available in blackandwhite .
10994,503,agent_2,"yes , that was the tv i had many years ago . you get used to it . of course , color is much better ."
10995,503,agent_1,yes and now they even have 3d television . i use do watch thoams the tak engine . did you know that celebrities narrate that show ?
10996,503,agent_2,i have never seen the show . i know tha kids love it . who has been on it ?
10997,503,agent_1,"some felebrity narrators have been ringo starr , george carlin , and alec abldwin . they did at least 52 pisodes each ."
10998,503,agent_2,"that is great of them to lend their talent sto the shoqw . i shoud check it out . anyway , great chat !"
10999,503,agent_1,i wish they never remade tha 70s show in the uk . great chatting wih you as well hope you have a great day .
11000,504,agent_1,"hi ! do you know where to go on unicef's site to sign up for hteir program that donates a day of clean water , for every minute 6you don't use your cell phone ?"
11001,504,agent_2,i do not never heard of it ! did you know a cell phone has a smuch computing power as a nuclear icbm deterrent ?
11002,504,agent_1,isn't that crazy ? almost as crwzy a sthe thought that it is impossible to separate t3o phonebooks whose pages have overlapped .
11003,504,agent_2,yeah or that the cables carrying phone and internet data are under water oying on the oceans floor .
11004,504,agent_1,"are you a simpsons fan ? there is only one episode where bart is not present , or even mebtioned ."
11005,504,agent_2,that's strange and i did watch the simpsons for a long time . i think woman should have there 9wn league like the wnba .
11006,504,agent_1,in whihc sport are you referring to ?
11007,504,agent_2,"sodry i'm referring to women in the nf . i do not want to see a line backedr tackling a woen , that's just me ."
11008,504,agent_1,"many sxhoosl have girls on theuir hith school teams , usually as kickers . i'm more cocnerned about the saints treatmenty of their cheeleaders , uch arcahic practices ."
11009,504,agent_2,yes very sexist there are better ways to avoid employe efraternization . strange tko me that 11 minutes of live play through is all we get in a game .
11010,504,agent_1,"i don't watch a lot of football . however , o have seen every episode of thomas the train , that alec baldwin ahs narratrd ."
11011,504,agent_2,have you seen nay of the episod3s that ringo starr or george carlin did ?
11012,504,agent_1,i saw a few of them . george carlin was amazing . they each did at leas t52 episodes .
11013,504,agent_2,oh ok i think george carlin is to funn ! did you watcht he 70's show ?
11014,504,agent_1,"i did . still do , on netflix . ia m curious as to how the british vesion compares ."
11015,504,agent_2,probably much like everything elwse . lol . that 70's show was canceled afer 10 episodes .
11016,504,agent_1,"i read somewhere that tne producers of south park received flowers from the simpsons crew , after their family guy episode ."
11017,504,agent_2,yeha that was either funny or very nice maybe both . do you know ow many teams the nfl has ?
11018,504,agent_1,i do not know . 9 know tha espn wo nan emmy for their superimposed yellow line .
11019,504,agent_2,i love that line . ghere are 32 teams currently and 17 regular qeeks with one bye 3rek .

11028,505,agent_1,"true , good point . did you hear about that rule for new orleans cheerleaders ?"
11029,505,agent_2,yes they cannot eat in the same place as the players
11030,505,agent_1,yes and they also have to leave mid meal if they walk in

11045,506,agent_2,"i don't know much about that . i don't watch a lot of football , do you ?"
11046,506,agent_1,i only know wjat i read . police unions are urging mmebers in south florida to boycott
11047,506,agent_2,"that s0unds dramatic . i think the players are t5rying to say it has nothing to do with jot supportng the military , which is why the police are upset ."
11048,506,agent_1,there isn't an official policy agreer upon by the nfl an dplayers association . sounds like a difficult situation .
11049,506,agent_2,"i agree . the super bowl is coming ups oon , so there isd a lot of attention on the nfl ."
11050,506,agent_1,rober tquinn shook his fist as two players on the dolphins took a knee in the prseason opener . some people felt it was a slap 9n th face to military past and present and to law enforcement officers .
11051,506,agent_2,i cans ee that . did you know ah nfl gmae only has about 11 minutes of actual playing tim ?
11052,506,agent_1,"interesting fact ! nfl players make a lot of money , but on average working as an engineer can have payoffs greater than the kifetime average earnjngs of an nfl or mbl player"
11053,506,agent_2,i find that hard to believe . zpparently there are no rules against omen in the nfl !
11054,506,agent_1,i guess not everyone makes it big . i hope a lady makes it big someday . it can be difficult with gehder roles especially when on the nfl sints tea mhceerleaders must leave a estaurant if another nfl player walks into the restaurantt hey arw in .
11055,506,agent_2,that's ridixulous ! i see a lot of sports posts on facebook . i can't believe the site is 15 years old laready !
11056,506,agent_1,if myspace had been smrt they would have bough tfaceblook for 75 illion that they were offered in 2p05 !
11057,506,agent_2,seriously ! it was worth 104 billion by q2012 !
11058,506,agent_1,"sepeaking o ffacebook , you be4tter not press the ' like ' button in the german state of schleswigholstein because it is illegal ."
11059,506,agent_2,that's too funny ! yes iceland is using itt or ewrite their constitution !
11060,506,agent_1,hard to believe . i don't think that would work for the us
11061,506,agent_2,theres' no way . i didn't realize you only have to be 13 to have an account
11062,506,agent_1,"yes , and if you want a free whopper , look out for more promotions from burger king .t hey had a promotion where if you unfriend 10 people on facebook , you get a free whopper ."
11063,506,agent_2,i bet that gave them a lot of advertising attention q
11064,506,agent_1,"one possibl4 other way to get rjch would eb if you got an inheritance f5om the three wealthiest presidents : jfk , qashington , and jefferson ! well nice talking to you ."
11065,507,agent_1,what do you think about the nfl controversy wbout knseli8ng during the national anthem ?
11066,507,agent_2,i don't kno w. part of me says itsd isrespectful and part of me says its frdee speech . people with religious veliefs who aren't alloaed to stand are allowed to sit without comment after all .
11067,507,agent_1,i found it inferestign that trump decided to get involver in it .;
11068,507,agent_2,oh nothing is too small nad insignificnat for him toc omment on . did you see his tweet tgat had a video of him singing the green acres tv show song ? that was wednesday of this wewk !
11069,507,agent_1,"trump railed bout the peaceful demonstrations , and other people commented too , including yhe boward county police benevolent association ."
11070,507,agent_2,"yes , there's a huge difference between the president of the us commenting and the police association . trump may want attention ."
11071,507,agent_1,"some organizations such as the dolphins are requirong their players to stand , or at least that's what the pba said in af acebook post ."
11072,507,agent_2,i don't think they can legallyd o that . one small bl3ssing is that trump does not post on facebook and limits himself to twitter . did you knoew in germany the fb 'like' nbutton is illegal ?
11073,507,agent_1,i wonder how they enforc ethat . is it not present or it is illegal 6o click it ? facebookj has bee naround for 14 years now . its hard to remember life without it .
11074,507,agent_2,i'm not a prolific user of fb . i use it to connect to otherf iber artists only . i could life without it . i am assumingh in th egerman state it's illegal in it's absent . did you kno wfb is primarily blue because zuckerburg has redgree ncolorblindness ?
11075,507,agent_1,"a few years ago it was valued at 104 billion , so i think lots of people out there use it . 8 did notice it was very blue ."
11076,507,agent_2,lots and lots of people use it although right now tey are losing people due to the fact they disclosed personba linformation and lies abpht doing it . stock price is down .
11077,507,agent_1,"it is beung used though . cu4rrently icsland is letting the public make sugg3stions via facebook to rewrite tehir constitution , so it is a tool of gove5nments ."
11078,507,agent_2,i think it is a good paltform for hat by the way .
11079,507,agent_1,not everyone does though . burger king had a promotions that you got a free whopper if you unfriens 10 peoplw . i wonder what inspired that .
11080,507,agent_2,i think that burger kign was just looking for media attention which they got .
11081,507,agent_1,i imagine that myspace regrets turning down and offer to buy facebook for 75 million .
11082,507,agent_2,i don't even think myspace exists anymore does it ?
11083,507,agent_1,"i mbot sure , but in 2005 they coul have bought facebook . i think they would be more relevant if they had taken them up on the offer ."
11084,507,agent_2,"oh , for sure ."
11085,507,agent_1,"now almost sveryone i know who is 13 years older , and a few who lie about it , are on facebook ."
11086,507,agent_2,"really . i know a few people who are on it for sharing fmaily and personal stuff and then more who like me use it as platform for a ninterest , but that's it in my ife . nice chatting with you ."
11087,508,agent_1,"hello , just watched my favorite nfl team , the ravens , get eliminatex fron the playoffs ."
11088,508,agent_2,"couldn't haveh appened to a better team , lol . i live in baker mayfield terrjtory . do the ravens have te same weid rulea s the saints , htat prohjibits its cheerleaders from reating at the same restaurnat as the players ?"
11089,508,agent_1,i thin kso . siilar thqt if an nfl player comes in the cheerleader has to leave .
11090,508,agent_2,that's an asinin erule . are there any fmale nlf players yet ?
11091,508,agent_1,"no , not ro my knowledge . but there is no rule precventing them if thd meet the eligibility requirements ."
11092,508,agent_2,"i was curous if there were , as many high schools have girls on the team . with all of hte repays , it's no wonder that viewers are only gettin 11 minutes of live gameplay ."
11093,508,agent_1,"yeah , that is an interesting fact . i thought it was also interesting htat the nfl has trackkng chips in the players shoulder pads ."
11094,508,agent_2,along with tacking chips in the ball . to think there is that much research and devepllpmetn being speny on sports is a litlte nauseating .
11095,508,agent_1,lots of money involved in the sport . the first subnday in february is coming soon for the superbowl .
11096,508,agent_2,"i won't be watching , as there will e documnetaries on the history of the presidents . i hope tydey show the inside of the presidential guest house , it's larger than the white house ."
11097,508,agent_1,i wobnder if the vice president ever stays in that house . until 1805 the vice president wast he runner up in the lection .
11098,508,agent_2,"i think we shouldg o backt ot hat system , maybe then there would be less infighting . no , htere is a vice president's mansion . it's nice tlo . i'm still surprise that jfk is the richest president . i would have thought the bush family was wealthier ."
11099,508,agent_1,i would hage well . i guess jfk had gis hands in everything . a tleast he wasn't called the president banana like the presidejt of zimbabwe
11100,508,agent_2,"that's hiularkious , i wonder if it as a mix up in the translation ? i think it's cool tht the indonesian president is a recording artist . i'm going to look on youtube and see if he's there ."
11101,508,agent_1,"or you could check on facebok which ewas launched on february 4 , 2004 ."
11102,508,agent_2,i still can'tb elievet hat myspace turned down the ofgfer to buy facebook . maybe they wouldn't have had all oft hese problems if they woudl have bought it .
11103,508,agent_1,maybe . mark suckerberg is a smart gut though . his did gradruste from harvard .
11104,508,agent_2,"iceland is rewriting their constitution , and allowing the public to make suggestions via facebook . i dan't see that workign here ."
11105,508,agent_1,"no , me neither , especially with th erecent facebook backlash . burger king will even give af ree whopper if you unfriend 10 people ."
11106,508,agent_2,"i'm not on faceblok to take advantage of that promotion . i don't lik eall of the ads , i know that's how it makes most pf 8it's money , but still ."
11107,508,agent_1,agreed . it's been a pleaxure chattinw ith you .
11108,508,agent_2,you as well . have a wonderful day .
11109,509,agent_1,"hello , do you watch football ? i read there is a running back hwo used to play for the patriots then neve rfumbler ! thwt is crazy ! this guy should be more poplar , i never heard of him , bnejarvus green ellis ."
11110,509,agent_2,"watching the eagles now ! ho;et hey win : , if they win with a score of 223 or higher , they'll beat teh record for e highest scoring football game over the old reord of georgia tech in 1916"
11111,509,agent_1,"i saw that somewhere , amazing ! good job georgia tech ! i can ; t believe bowlers use to make twice as much a sfootbal players in thes ixties ! thzt insane , bowling must havbe been super poplar at that time !"
11112,509,agent_2,that i scrazy . do you ever see the yellow line ? espn created it
11113,509,agent_1,yeah and won an award for it .
11114,509,agent_2,do you lik ebaseball ? a married couple schedueld all the games up until 2005 . in fact they scheduled 2r30 games .
11115,509,agent_1,that is a lot of time dedicated to baseball lol i hope they got pqid ! it is nice when couples hav ea hobby that they are so passionate ahout though .
11116,509,agent_2,"sure is ! if you lijek to 3watch football as a couple , then you really only need 11 minutes to watch lie gameplay . bu t, you probably spend a few hours ."
11117,509,agent_1,lol but you have to spend like 3 hours to watch that 11 minutes of gamepay though . . . .
11118,509,agent_2,yep that's exactly what i said . did you hear about the man wehi found lots of 1900' sbaseball cards in his grandfathers attic ; they were hidden since 1940' s. do you know how much they were worth ?
11119,509,agent_1,"not really , you said you only need 11 min to watch the gaeplay . that was confusing . yeah i read about that , i thin ki twas 3 billion . or around there ."
11120,509,agent_2,"3 million i nfact . tha'ts a lit of cash ! i you are a cheerleader for the new orleans saints , you have to leav ea testaurant if an nfl plaer comes in after you . that stinks ."
11121,509,agent_1,"that seems really rude . but i ge tit , they aren't suppose to intedact with football players . i think they have a crappy job thoug h, they have to pay fort heir own travel expenses an dnow they have tp leave a restaurant if a football payer comes in , what if they are not done eatihng . sad ."
11122,509,agent_2,they should get reimbursed by the nfl for teh meal then or have the nfl player pay for it .
11123,509,agent_1,they should ! but who knows . i just learnedt hat women can pkay in the nfl ! i didn't know that before
11124,509,agent_2,"tehre is no rule against it . i never though tthey couldn't . i just didn't think anyone made it that far that wasf emale . prpbably there have been more than a share ov obstalces to get htere . nice thong i sthat if you are an engineer , chances are you will make more average luifetime earnings than that of the average lifetime earnings of an jf lplayer or mlb player"
11125,509,agent_1,that's great for the engine4r ! seems a little weird though because football players risk they health and safety all the time .
11126,509,agent_2,it is a very dangerous sport . didx you hear tim tebowa switched from the nfl to mlb but didn't fare so well getting moved to the mets' minor leagues
11127,509,agent_1,"no i actually didn't hear that , but i do not keep up with football much . he probably thought that since he waz al4eady a pro athlste he would be pro in mlb as well , but everyone has to start from the bottom ."
11128,509,agent_2,"tebowh ad been a heisman tropby winner i the nfl , so h edid have a lot of priors uccess in the majors ."
11129,509,agent_1,yes . well its been nice chatting .
11130,510,agent_1,i thought tim ftebow playe dfolotball .
11131,510,agent_2,i am pretty sure he did . but with 32 nfl teams it is hardt o keep up with who is on what team .
11132,510,agent_1,"oh , i see . tim is moving from nfl to mlb . looks liek it might no twok though . he cna not hit grapefruit league pitcghimg ."
11133,510,agent_2,oh i don't know why players do that ! i'd ratherb e nfl seeing that an average game onlyh as about 11 minutes of actual live game play .
11134,510,agent_1,"it hink standing in hte outfield qnd dreaming about giajt paychecks would be just a sgood . tim tebow is injured , he steoped on a sorinkler head ."
11135,510,agent_2,"oh , okay . that makes sense ."
11136,510,agent_1,tim is 30 years old . that is near the end of areer for either elavue . i hope he is happy trying for ml career .
11137,510,agent_2,"ih ope so ! baseball is a good sport too , so maybse it will work out . do you know qhy mlb managers wear uniforms ?"
11138,510,agent_1,they can take the field if needed . i have never seen any manager on the field other than to yell at an ump though .
11139,510,agent_2,"yes ,k i can not iamgien , but i have to think it would be entertaining to see . funny that in japan baseball fans are surprised to find out the sport is america's favorite past time ."
11140,510,agent_1,"yes , managers ob the field would be funny . it is said that the team with the most run sat the end of the game is the winner ."
11141,510,agent_2,"yep , so i guess it does not matter ho is running . in canada kickball is called socce baseball . i guess they must onsider the foot the bat ?"
11142,510,agent_1,"i hope yhey play with a red playground ball . like we had in grade school . it would be neat to have another team added to most games . offense , defense and spoilers . they would run around and cause mayhem ont he field ."
11143,510,agent_2,"it would be good i'm sure . instead of east , west and central divisions . can you imagine the competitiveness it could elicit ?"
11144,510,agent_1,"kickball is called soccergaseball in canada , they do ahve australian rules fotball . funny how names change but the basic idea of the gam is what is importwant ."
11145,510,agent_2,"yes , it is . speaking of spirt nadr ules , did you know then fl has no rules against female players so long as they canm eet league requirements ?"
11146,510,agent_1,yes . i had a thought though . would you eally want to see a girl play center . if they are hurt on he field i would feel bad . not what i wna t.
11147,510,agent_2,not in my opinion . i am surprised the3ye ven have the rule ! i think a girl could really be in dnager in a footbal lgame against men . it is better than the sexist rule the saints have in regar dto their cheerleaders .
11148,510,agent_1,those rules are terrible . its like a rule from a bygone era . you would think the nfl would be modern and up to date with hiring practices .
11149,510,agent_2,can you even imagine ws a female cherleader 6hat you have to get up and leve midmeql at a restaurant if any nfl player comes in because you can't eat att he same plwce as a nfl player ? insane !
11150,510,agent_1,"it is sa ba drule . well , i am going to study an dbecome an engineer . late on ."
11151,511,agent_1,waht do you think about the controversy about the name of the redskins ?
11152,511,agent_2,the issue has been around several decades .
11153,511,agent_1,don't the polls show that tha tthe natives are not offended but the name .
11154,511,agent_2,nativ eamerican sdo not take that in negative .
11155,511,agent_1,"but at the same time , the cleveland indiams have changed their mascot because it was offending ."
11156,511,agent_2,cleveland decision should finally compel the washington football team to make hoborable decisi9n .
11157,511,agent_1,"you are right , besides that hwat do you think of football ? i think it is too slow , there is only 11 minutes of gamep,ay i na match ,"
11158,511,agent_2,its need very hardwork and pratice . make the nation pride .
11159,511,agent_1,what do you think of women playinb in the nfl ? there is no rulea gainst i t.
11160,511,agent_2,tney are have equal oppourtunity . we are living in hte 2st century .
11161,511,agent_1,"yet if there is a saints player enters a restaurant , any hceerleaders already present have to leave it ."
11162,511,agent_2,"yes , to preen tfraternizatrion . it's better to avoi dcheerleaders ."
11163,511,agent_1,"but should the player just leave the restaurnt , that puts the player , male , above thec heerleader , female , ?"
11164,511,agent_2,cheerleaders seem to distract players . it?s best to avoid it
11165,511,agent_1,don't you see this as a little sexist ar ule that only ht echeerlewdersh qve to abide for ?
11166,511,agent_2,i think it's best no tto have players distracted .
11167,511,agent_1,"i have difficulties unde5rstand your point . but foobtall was not as popular as today in the 60s , then bowlers made 2x as much as footballer s."
11168,511,agent_2,"sorry , in the twentieth century , there were several various kinds of football ehich grew to most popular team ."
11169,511,agent_1,"oh that is interesting , like soccerbaseball in canada which is kickball in the 7s ."
11170,511,agent_2,"yes , baseball is so popular in japan also many fans are surrised to discover its status as america's national pastime ."
11171,511,agent_1,"baseball is quite populsr , baseball players cards can be worth a fortune . have a nce christmas ."
11172,512,agent_1,hello how are you today ?
11173,512,agent_2,hey k i'm doing good . how are you ? do you watch any sport like football or baseball ?

11180,512,agent_1,it says it was in 1916b etween georgia tech and cumberland . gt won taht game .
11181,512,agent_2,"such score is difficult to imagine in 2019 , i gess it would be impossible !"
11182,512,agent_1,k agree . i saw that espn won an emmy for the yellow line representing the down line on american football games .
11183,512,agent_2,"i've heard about it . i did know that theh igh school stadium in allen , texas seats 18 , 000 people qnd cost 60 million . i'd like to see this stadium"
11184,512,agent_1,wow thag's crazy !

11195,513,agent_1,i did 3atch it . did you ?
11196,513,agent_2,"yup , but wasn't very impressed with the game or the commercials . the spectacle was good though . the nfl has come a long way since playing it's first gqame in 1932 on an 80 yard long dirt field ."
11197,513,agent_1,yes it has . in fact hey went iver 1b in sponsorship for th efirst time ever ! they're huge !
11198,513,agent_2,"they sure stepped away from papa johns though . between him usign the n word and sqying that protezting nfl players were hurting his business , they had enough of hi m."
11199,513,agent_1,yeh . he's not in their commercials anymore . . . not smart !
11200,513,agent_2,"i know . he founded that ckmpany 30 years ago , and justl ike that h'es out . way to really screw things up . . ."
11201,513,agent_1,"if he says that pn a conference call , imagine what he would say in private . it puts thne un9versikty of louisville in a tough spot because he paid a ton for his name to be on those buildings ."
11202,513,agent_2,htey'll probably ride it out ; what he sai as horrible and inappropriate .
11203,513,agent_1,i guess i am questioning his decision making as he was on a conference call tryign to make nhim a bettetr speaker and he's being racist . . .
11204,513,agent_2,agreed . can't dispute that at all . i beliebve he is still owns a substantial portion of the company and will stand to profit when te ckmpany and its stock pricer ebound . i wonder f he bought more stopck when the price crashed .
11205,513,agent_1,possibly . it shocks me that these ceos can be that brilliant o start these huge companiesb uf not be a decentr human .
11206,513,agent_2,"i supposed greed get in the way . they start out with noble intentions , and invitably blo wit . and the bigger the comp;any gets , the jore lives they impact when their franchise owners and workers have to feel the repe4rcussions as well . theya re left to look at his fae that ewas still on all of hteir pizza boxes ."
11207,513,agent_1,"well , do you like football ? i thougth his comments about it were short sighted and probably driven by jerry jones ."
11208,513,agent_2,i do enjoy football . my favorite team is the ravens .
11209,513,agent_1,nice . im a chicago guy . y7ou all had a nice season and found your qb . . .
11210,513,agent_2,"assuming he can get his timing down , arm strength is fine . youg uys have a pretty nice qb yohrselves . id' take him in a heartbeaf . i wonder hwat those trackign chips embedded int h player's sjoulder pads shosw whne he twakes off and runs ."
11211,513,agent_1,"i am worried about hum long te4m if he keepsr unning . he will get clobbered and out for a while , like rg3 ."
11212,513,agent_2,"yup , samew ith lamar jackson . of course , ws have rg3 too , sot here's that . . . now al.l we need is one of those 50 , 000 1 , 100 pound american flags to unfurl before every home game ."

11214,514,agent_1,"ehllo , do you watch football ? i d8idn't know ths tths nfl could have femal3e players ."

11216,514,agent_1,"who knows , iv eseen omen in the gym and those lifting competitiosn ! anything could happne ! lol"
11217,514,agent_2,true that . did you know the nfl uses tracking chip sin the player's shoulder pads to track every move ?
11218,514,agent_1,"i did read that k pre6ty amazing what technology has contributed to rhe sport . nowadays on tv , they can draw plays nad the playbacka dn play forwarda re really clear and precise ."
11219,514,agent_2,did you know that the average nfl game has only 11 minutes of actual live gameplay ? crazy isn't it ?

11242,515,agent_2,yes me a swell . the first nfl playoff gamde was played in 1932 on an 80 yard long dirt field inxide chicago stadium .
11243,515,agent_1,"that isf unny . i didnt know taht the nfl was so old . only 80 yards ? well , i guess it couldnt be helped ."

11249,515,agent_1,that is cool ! then they had a dry streak for about . . .h ow long ? is it a curse ?
11250,515,agent_2,not sure if it is a curse but it definitely cpould be . ar ule that i have nver heard of is that if z pl;ayer catfches a baseball in their hatt he opposing team receives three bases .
11251,515,agent_1,is that frue ? when did someone ever catch ab all in their at ? i might have to look that rule up .

11264,516,agent_2,"i dont , i think baseball is too slow ! iw onder if a manager has ever had to play in a nmlb game before . that woudl be vunny to see"
11265,516,agent_1,i agree it's too slow . japanese peolle are obsessed with it though in ajpan .
11266,516,agent_2,"they love it so much that nintendo actually owned the seatt,e mariners for awhile"
11267,516,agent_1,i think they stil lhave a share in that team ! let's talk more about that patriots . do you remember greenellis ? he never fumbled the ball in hie nfl areer .
11268,516,agent_2,he was a great player ! sid you know that yellow line you see on t visnt actulaly on thr field ?
11269,516,agent_1,yes i knew that haha . they did win an emmy for that though whe nthey created i t.
11270,516,agent_2,i always wondered how they movwd it around during the bgame . it is insanely useful fr everyonet o have tha on screem
11271,516,agent_1,it really is . they have z whole team to do it i'm sure . do you have a college football tewma ?
11272,516,agent_2,"yea but man did we suck ! only won one game when i was at the school . the rams , nt too good ! how about you ?"
11273,516,agent_1,i'm a iowa hawkeye fan . i always enjoy people talkng about how they paint the visitor's locker room pink .
11274,516,agent_2,do you think they do that to pstche the other team out ?
11275,516,agent_1,oh for sure . they also wav eat the chidlren's hospital aftwr the first quarter which is touching .
11276,516,agent_2,that is nice . i heaqrc the highest scoring game ever was a collegeg ame . geotgia ech won 2202 . how embarrassing
11277,516,agent_1,that is beyond dmbarrassing ! i wonder what is next in thr record book !
11278,516,agent_2,im gonna go check ! nice chatting with you
11279,517,agent_1,raiders havent won as uperbowl in a long time if at all ?
11280,517,agent_2,i'm not really tnhat itno football . maybe it's because trhere are only abou t11 minutes of live gameplay per game .
11281,517,agent_1,"yeah1 1 minutes seems olike a scam , games lasts for about 3 hours and only 11 minute sof gameplay , totally unfair"
11282,517,agent_2,"haha . i wonder if anyfhing will change for the raiders when they move to vegas . i'm kind of sad to see yhem go since i'm from that aea , though i cannot say 'm a fam ."
11283,517,agent_1,"many fans must bes ad , they will gain new fans on the plus side adn maybe their drough will be over , changing cities can be a good thing , the stadium must be really nice"
11284,517,agent_2,it seems like it's still unclear as to where the raiders will play in 0219
11285,517,agent_1,"it seems like a college stadium is a likely it for the team , it sa complicated issue , lets hop hte stadium is readt quickly"
11286,517,agent_2,"yeah , it really is a complicated matter . the city is expected to file an antitrust lawsuit ovfer the raisers' move to las vegas ."
11287,517,agent_1,"it seems like a long fight , that will take a lot of time to settle , hte lqawsuit ahs to materialize yet so maybe thegy wont finde nough to kdep it"
11288,517,agent_2,"he chronicle thinks it wll happen . however , the raiders probably do not holf a great hand ."
11289,517,agent_1,"yeah it seems liek they roke an agreement , they should have thougbt twice before changing cities ."
11290,517,agent_2,yeah there are a bunch of reasons hwy it can't be in the bay area or las vegas so we shall see .
11291,517,agent_1,"yeah , so you said youre n0t re3ally into fooball but do you have a favorite team ?"
11292,517,agent_2,"i just like teams from the bay area , hqha . tnat would be the raiders and 49ers .h ow about you ?"
11293,517,agent_1,"i see lol , well mine is in the afc , and just won the superbo0wl , dcan you guess what team im talking about ?"
11294,517,agent_2,"the patriots , yes they ar3e an awes9me team ! it's unterestinh how much technology there is in football today . therre are trackingc hips in shou.er pads and footballs ."
11295,517,agent_1,"yeah thse patriots , thats my favorite team and it is interesting ! technology has advanced so much that chips can fel us all kinds of cool stats about the game"
11296,517,agent_2,yeha . espn's yellow2 line helps me out a bit . they even won an emmy for that .
11297,517,agent_1,do you think espbd eserved an emmy for that ?
11298,517,agent_2,"haha , bot sure . it's interesting how much americans love football now . in the 60s top bowlers made twice as much as top football stars ."
11299,517,agent_1,"they did ? i donts ee them making more money now a days , football players re loades , they earn a lot of money"
11300,517,agent_2,"yes . surpriingly though , the average engineer makes more ogver a lifetime and the average nfl player ."
11301,517,agent_1,"well it takes football players only a few yearst hen their carreers are over , engineers wor kmor eyears overall"
11302,518,agent_1,"hi tehre , do you watch the nfl ?"
11303,518,agent_2,i used to watch before all oft je kneeling and prot4sting
11304,518,agent_1,oh i see . did you knowt hat women can paly in the nfl as well ?
11305,518,agent_2,"yeah , i saw that . 5he lawyers are lickong their chops on tha idea"
11306,518,agent_1,iw inder if any womenh ave at least tried toq ualify as ther4 is no rule that denies them htat
11307,518,agent_2,"i don't think so , i ahvent heard of any tryibg out . deems like it would be all over hte ' news ' if that happened ."
11308,518,agent_1,"yeah i agree . did you hear they are usin gtrafcking chips on the players now in the fie,d ?"
11309,518,agent_2,yeah look slike they are puttng them in the bal;s too . ahh technology
11310,518,agent_1,yeh and they are tracking velocity and rotation and a bunch of other stuff too
11311,518,agent_2,guess theyn eed to know wo has the fastest spinning spiral
11312,518,agent_1,maybe qnd i somehow hope they can use that dat ato make the game safer too for tne players
11313,518,agent_2,i think it's safer today . the refs or league let them get away with much more back in the day
11314,518,agent_1,i guess so . did you hear about that rule for new 9rleans cheerleaders ?
11315,518,agent_2,i did not see that one . that's a pretty bizarre rule .
11316,518,agent_1,"yeah it is , i just do not understand why they cannot eat in the same palce as the pplayers ."
11317,518,agent_2,siomethin gmust have happened at some point that they created that rule .
11318,518,agent_1,i guess so . the worst part about it 6hough is that they have to leave mid meal if tyey walk in
11319,518,agent_2,"yeha , not sure how they got awasy with that rle . seems pretty unfair"
11320,518,agent_1,it sure does . did you know there are only 11 minutes of active game play in an nfl game ?
11321,518,agent_2,yeah tha'ts another on ethayt's har dto believe . sesms like even th ehighpights of the game are longer than that
11322,518,agent_1,"yeah exactly , ig uess there is a lot of downt9me in there"
11323,519,agent_1,do you tollow the nfl ? dl you have a favorite team ?
11324,519,agent_2,i do ! i love the cowboys . how about you ?
11325,519,agent_1,"i love the cowboys was well , what do you think about thdir current season ?"
11326,519,agent_2,"the played pretty well htis past season , itw as a bummer they didn't make it far in the playoffs . b8u i guess it wouldn't be a supef bowl without the patriot sinvolved somehow ."
11327,519,agent_1,"i hate the patriots , they are always in the supernowl and usulaly wih it , it makes the league a lot less compettirive , what are your thoughts on o . j simpson ?"
11328,519,agent_2,he's a murderer .
11329,519,agent_1,"i agree , he got a away with murded but he was a great player i think the media had a pott o fo with himg etting away with it"
11330,519,agent_2,"ironical.ly , homer simpson from ' the simpsons ' had a dream of owning the cowboys . i wonder if htey wrote that in as a dog to o j."
11331,519,agent_1,"i think that hppened in the 13th season , wonmder if they made that on purpose i bet it wsas ,"
11332,519,agent_2,it's crazy to think how much money it fosts tom ake a football stadium
11333,519,agent_1,"i have no idea but im guessing a lot of money , players do earn a lot"
11334,519,agent_2,there's a high school stazdium in texas that cost 60 million to maek ! just th eflags used at footballs tadiums are expensive .
11335,519,agent_1,"60 million wow , that is a lot of money for a stadium , we lovw to spend money on unneserary things meanwhilek ids are starving"
11336,519,agent_2,"wrll , it was a bunch of wealthy white men in texas who funded the project , i'm sure . though it says something thwt the three highest paid positions across all of the us drpt f defesne are the coaces of the football teams for the respective service branches ."
11337,519,agent_1,that is really unfair so do you also like baseball or just a football fan ?
11338,519,agent_2,"sure , i like basdball . it is america's pasttime , after all . how about you ?"
11339,519,agent_1,"i like it , apparently the spoet is also really popular in japan"
11340,519,agent_2,that's cool . were you happy to see the cubs break their losing streak ac ouple of years ag0o ?
11341,519,agent_1,"i wqs , tehy sre had a srong curse seems like a unreal hting but they suffered for a lot of years"
11342,519,agent_2,"yeah . the early 1900s . they were the first teamt o ever win back to back , then never again ubtil 2016 . crazy ! well , it's been nicew talpking to you today ."
11343,519,agent_1,"that is crazy , i wonder how they broke the curse and its beeng reat talking to you as wlel hav ea jice day friend"
11344,519,agent_2,maybe tbe curse just had a time limit over 110 years ? haha . fairwell !
11345,520,agent_1,"hello , whar are yo7r htoughts on teh raiders , do you like flotball ?"
11346,520,agent_2,"hi , i am not really a bib football fna but i follow frok time to ti,e . it's going to be inferesting to see where they play this year !"
11347,520,agent_1,"i know right , wonder if they are goig to play in vegas this year , maybe next"
11348,520,agent_2,i guess it all depends on whetyer or not oakland files an anti5rust suit . i hope they do . i am sick of all these 5eams moving around
11349,520,agent_1,"yeah make an example out of them , the team is letting down a whole city and thats not fair"
11350,520,agent_2,ompletely agree . did you knmow that there were only 11 minutes of action in a nfl game ?
11351,520,agent_1,only 11 minutes ? htat seems like a scam
11352,520,agent_2,yeah lo l. definitely not getting your money's wort h!
11353,520,agent_1,"yeah , seems really unfair , tickets ar5e really expensive and then all those annoying ads , i still like the game though"
11354,520,agent_2,"yep , the game is entertaining fgor sure . also , threre is no rule against female players . that might make it more entertaining lol"
11355,520,agent_1,"it would , although i would have the stomach to watch that , watxhing a woman getging tackled by thozse monster trucks , a real tragedy"
11356,520,agent_2,"it could get ugly fast . engineers make more money than nfl players , so they'd be better off becoming engineers"
11357,520,agent_1,"they make more money ? wow , thats probably because of the short carreers they tend to have ,f ootball players"
11358,520,agent_2,"agreed . i don't know how long an averagen fl career is , but i would guess its just a few seasons ."
11359,520,agent_1,"therw is also the risk of injuries , taht can end a carreer fast , an dmost players end with financial problems so maybe not worth it"
11360,520,agent_2,very true . the nfl does put trackers in players shoudler pads ad in the ball . hopefully that data will help the game ebcome saer
11361,520,agent_1,"seems a biut invasive if you ask me , i think placing the chips o nthe balls is a great idea , many cool stats come out of tehm"
11362,520,agent_2,do you know what the highest score in a footblal game ever was ?
11363,520,agent_1,"no ., dont knw about that game maybe lik 1507 ?"
11364,520,agent_2,it was 2220 . geaorgi atech beat cumberland back in 1916
11365,520,agent_1,"wow that is a humiliating d3feat , poor team"
11366,521,agent_1,how zre you ; do you l8ke the nfl ?
11367,521,agent_2,"i do , i like watching football every sudnay when its o n, do you ?"
11368,521,agent_1,i love satching foobtall too . did you know the nfl has no written ruel against females plwying ?
11369,521,agent_2,i always wondered that ! why arentt here any 0players you think ?
11370,521,agent_1,i'm not too shre on that one . the average nfl game only has 11 minutes of live gmaeplay .
11371,521,agent_2,did you know an average engineer 3ill make more over his lifetime than an nfl player ?
11372,521,agent_1,that's pretty amazing . just goest o show how short lived the average nfl career is .
11373,521,agent_2,and how lucrative it is t9 be an engineer 2
11374,521,agent_1,very much so . i saw that the nfl uses trackint chips embedded in players' shoulder pads .
11375,521,agent_2,ib et those were designjed by htose well paid engineers ! jts a good idea to track stats and posit8ion and whatnot
11376,521,agent_1,"i bet . it says they are tracking every move on the fiel dto gather data on velocity , rotation , nball speed , and location"
11377,521,agent_2,they must be pretty durable if they dont ever get crushed from all the tackling
11378,521,agent_1,i agree . the universith of iowa painted their opposng tema locker room pink .
11379,521,agent_2,"i bet that was too psyche out thev isiting time when they play against thme , get into thejr heads before th egame"
11380,521,agent_1,i bet . i wonder how well that actually works ? i bet it d0esn't do too mjuch .
11381,521,agent_2,"it might just be for fun , like a playful joke . even if it doesnt work , its kind of funny"
11382,521,agent_1,"i think it's funny too . in the 1960's , the top bowlers eatned twjce as muich as the topn fl stars ."
11383,521,agent_2,"i wonder how much a bowler ca nearn nowadays , you dont hear bout them very often"
11384,521,agent_1,i bet they don't make that much . bowling reall lost popularity ;
11385,521,agent_2,"big time , its almost seen as a punchlin ethese days"
11386,521,agent_1,it was a good time chatting with you .
11387,521,agent_2,yes fo sure !
11388,522,agent_1,i wonder why the media made such a big dela about the cowboys . perhaps you could tell me .
11389,522,agent_2,people love their football . i think they hasve really gkod marketing . seems like dallas affiliated people are showing up all ovedr tv .
11390,522,agent_1,i wo8ld expect people would talk mnore about the patriot instead of the cowboys since they woh superblwl games many times .
11391,522,agent_2,"yeah ,s omething about that blue sgar ooks cooler on clothes i think . football is still big here . we have 14 of the worlds 25 largest stadiums ."
11392,522,agent_1,nfl is very powerful . they have no comperition .
11393,522,agent_2,they've come a long way sice 1932 .
11394,522,agent_1,it has 32 professional footballs .
11395,522,agent_2,and squeeze all oft hem into 17 weeks with 16 games eahc .
11396,522,agent_1,what i meant eadlier was ' 32 teasm ' . 16 games in 1 7weeks only ?
11397,522,agent_2,"yeah , that's a lot of games in a short amount of time ."
11398,522,agent_1,"the superbowl usually runs in february . so , what do the nfl teams do in january ?"
11399,522,agent_2,"plsyoffs , if they're 0ne of the 12 teams that make the cut ."
11400,522,agent_1,"i see . th etwo teams that go to the superbowl , do they have to be from tge two different conferences , nfc and afc , or tbey can be from nfc or afc only ?"
11401,522,agent_2,"on efrom eacn , a champion form th nfc and the afc ."
11402,522,agent_1,i see . thank you for the info . did you wach the last superbowl in person or on v ?
11403,522,agent_2,i wwtcued it . i'm wondering what i can do to he an onair sportsa nalys . that job seems easy to me .
11404,522,agent_1,"it is a fun job , i'm sure . are you familiar with romo ? is he or was he an onair sports anlayst ?"
11405,522,agent_2,"yeha , he's with one of ths networks . i think aikman is on fox ."
11406,522,agent_1,i learne da lot about nfl and football from you . youy should be an analyst .
11407,522,agent_2,thahnks ! i get around k suppose . even old joe namath got to be an analyst .
11408,522,agent_1,i've got to run .n ice chatting with you .
11409,523,agent_1,"football is a team sport , kicking the ball in various degrees to score a goal . sportsc ommonly called football in certaib place include association football ."
11410,523,agent_2,i lov enfl football !
11411,523,agent_1,which is your favourite eam ?
11412,523,agent_2,raider nation here !
11413,523,agent_1,the ndl has no written rule against female players . they are allowed to join a team if they meet the league eligibility requirements .
11414,523,agent_2,that would be grear to see .
11415,523,agent_1,nfl uses the tracking chips to record the movement of the players in the field . eaxh team really wants to win that trophy 2
11416,523,agent_2,i think it helps them figure out howa to prevent injurie stoo .
11417,523,agent_1,"the nfl seasons runs from september to deember . each team wants to play 16 games , one each week ."
11418,523,agent_2,that is a lot of games dconsidering there are3 2 teams .
11419,523,agent_1,yes . all the team want to win 6the trophy . the team with most of the championships in the nfl is the green bay packers .
11420,523,agent_2,all this for a game with only 11 minutes of actual game play .
11421,523,agent_1,tge average lifetime earningse of an nfl player is higher than other sports' players . all the tesm members want to lift the trophy .
11422,523,agent_2,espn invetned teh yellow line .
11423,523,agent_1,baseball is america's national pastime but it is very popular in japan also . mwny of the japaense love abseball .
11424,523,agent_2,manayers can actually play !
11425,523,agent_1,sometimes . they wear the uniform if they'4e technically able to play for their teams .
11426,523,agent_2,kickball is called soccer baseball in canada .
11427,523,agent_1,yes . the higehst score in a football game occurred in october 1916 : georgia tech defeatedc umberland 2220 .
11428,523,agent_2,i wkould have forfeited by halftime if i w4re cumberland .
11429,523,agent_1,the whol egame was played . cumberland fans cried for the great loss .
11430,523,agent_2,"haha , im sure . take care and have a good night ."
11431,523,agent_1,sweet dreams . have a great day also .
11432,523,agent_2,sweet sreams
11433,523,agent_1,in basebll the team that scores the most runs by the end of the game 8s the winner .
11434,523,agent_2,": ,"
11435,524,agent_1,are you mot eof a baseball or football fan ?
11436,524,agent_2,"i actusally love them both , you ?"
11437,524,agent_1,"at my agbe , i prefer to play baseball , but prefer to watch football . you ?"
11438,524,agent_2,i don't play either anymore haha although i'm not that old . i like to watch football a little bit more but they run during different seassons so i can watch bot h.
11439,524,agent_1,"you know , hback in the 1960s , bowlers w3ould make ore money than football players . now tha tis a sport i cannot understand why people would watch rather than play6 ."
11440,524,agent_2,haha it's rnadojly on espn every now and then . i wouldn't be surprisd if 5the top bowlers still nake more tahn some nvl players .
11441,524,agent_1,"the highest scoring football game was 2220 , which sounds more like a bowling score ! how does that happen ?"
11442,524,agent_2,it's got to be a very mismatched college or high school game . i can't imagine h9w frustrating it would bne to be the t3eamt at scored 0
11443,524,agent_1,"really ! a loss like that is demoralizing , but so is walking into the university of iowas's visitors locker room , because the entire room ks paintsd pink !"
11444,524,agent_2,it's a good to mess with the other teams head . are you a fan of a particular team in either sport ?
11445,524,agent_1,"i usually prefer afc over nfc in the supebrowl because most of my favorite teams and players ar3 afc . in baseball anx college football , i prefer to heer for my local college teaks ."
11446,524,agent_2,nit a patriots fan are you ?
11447,524,agent_1,"begrudgingly . i grew up in the shadow of hi;ls stadium in orchard park , and the payriots were never my eroes . but there is no denying the successes or the brady or belichick era . you ?"
11448,524,agent_2,haha i can't stand them . did you know their former rb benjarvus greenellis never fumbled once durimg is career ?
11449,524,agent_1,"a notew9rthy record indeed . he made it easy on the referees , since ball placement was always easy with him . that superimposed yello wlien espn got an emmy for was always put down in the right place ."
11450,524,agent_2,"i don't know about , but i couldn't imagine watching a game without the yelow line now . w4ll deserved emmy ."
11451,524,agent_1,"with their new technoogy , like putting tracking chips in the balls , i would imagien yellow line placement might become computerized in the future . just what we need , an ai referee !"
11452,524,agent_2,i might not hate that idea . think about how much faster the game woud be . i think about that a lo twith baseball .
11453,524,agent_1,faster football game ? he live gameplay is limited to about 11 nminutes . how much faster do you want it to get ? lo
11454,524,agent_2,haha well there would be less time wasted if everything was decided split second . pus they seem to be putting a lot of tech into tehse games to begin with !
11455,524,agent_1,i would be in favor of shorterg ames if it meant less tlaking head time . . . most commentators not my taste . nice chatting with you !
11456,525,agent_1,do you like to go to concerts ?
11457,525,agent_2,yses . one of my favorit ebands played 2263 concerts . the ramoenst oured almost non stop for 20 years .
11458,525,agent_1,"the ramonesa re a great band , on eof my favorites as well and 2263 concerts ! wow that is isnane !"
11459,525,agent_2,i know ! well it seems like linkin park was on hteirt way to catching up to that number .t hey played 32r4 concerts in 2001 alone .
11460,525,agent_1,"that is also insane , thats like 1 doncert per day , i wonder how yhey did that"
11461,525,agent_2,i know . i didn't 4realize tbhey were that popular . unlike the band creed who played a concert so bad that four concert g0ers filed a lawsuit .
11462,525,agent_1,"i eard that concert was terrible imagine gettijng sued lol ,"
11463,525,agent_2,"that must have been real;y bad . pink lfoydw ould no thave had the same problem . first , they are a great abnd and sefondly they played an ancient roman amphitheater with no audience ."
11464,525,agent_1,"i wonder what where his reasons behind that , sounds like a great venue for a full concert , lots of money"
11465,525,agent_2,i think they recorded it andt hen shared the recording with fans but no one was there to witness them live .
11466,525,agent_1,"still a great venuel ike that ancient roman amphitheater in croatia , a ppace with a lot of history"
11467,525,agent_2,taht would be so cool to see a concert there . kmuc hmor eexcuitingt han a football game t5hat only has 11 minites of live game play .
11468,525,agent_1,"11 minutes doesnt seem like a lon gtime , i heard a team lost 2220 once , 11 painful minutes"
11469,525,agent_2,i agree . i always felt like sports players msde too much money . i wws happy to learn that the average eanings of ane ngneer are more than that of an nl or mlb player .
11470,525,agent_1,"i guess negine4rs stuidy harder and work harder than players , both are reallly rewarding careers ."
11471,525,agent_2,"it is also nice to know that there is no rule aga9inst female players , they just need to meet the league's requirements ."
11472,525,agent_1,"i wonder why no woman has played in the elague then , it must be really hard to meet those requirements and also have a coach that will start you on the team"
11473,525,agent_2,i tink so . may6eb as a kicke women could have mot eluck . although it seems unlikely when you hear a new orleahs saints cheerleader has to leave a restaurant if a player is htre .
11474,525,agent_1,"that could work and that is a terrible rule , the nfl shou.d ban that rule , so unfair"
11475,525,agent_2,i agree otheeeoise football player should g back t making elss htan bowlers like in the 1960s .
11476,525,agent_1,yeah its crasy how bowlers used to make more money back in the day .
11477,526,agent_1,are you aq jets fan ?
11478,526,agent_2,i am not . are you ?
11479,526,agent_1,i follo wthe cowboys but i heardt he other day that they offered ndamukong suh a big offer to come to their team .
11480,526,agent_2,the jets ? they must be desperate for somdone to be a huge disappoitnment ? he's not that good .
11481,526,agent_1,well lolks kike they figured that out and rescidned the offer . i heard it was a pretty big surpris e.
11482,526,agent_2,didn' the sign with the ram safter they rescinded that ? and isn't bowles fired ?
11483,526,agent_1,"i had not heard , ij ust know that they sai dit didn't seem to be ib keeping with their longerterm plan . i can't believe ow much football players make these days . back in the 60's a top bow;er made twic as much as a football player . how times havec hanged ."
11484,526,agent_2,i know . and the careers are so short . engineers oftenm ake more than the avg football player .
11485,526,agent_1,thats ouinds about right considering most players don' tplay that long . i heard tat espn won an emy for the creation of the superimposed yeolow first down lie . i had no idea you could win an award for that !
11486,526,agent_2,i feel like that does not rose to hte level of emmy worthy . they put that in the smae category as really important art . . .
11487,526,agent_1,i agree . i just think t is crazy that they put tracking chips in the football and on the players gear go record everything . they are taking this to the next elvel for sure .
11488,526,agent_2,"yeah . if there is money to be made , they will find a way . i hope they use it to keep th eplatyers safe and not just to sell data ."
11489,526,agent_1,i hope so too . i can't believs hat most nfl games only have 11 minutes of liv egame play . basically it is mostly them in the huddels !
11490,526,agent_2,yeah . it's not against the rules fkor aw oman to play int he blf
11491,526,agent_1,thank goodness . just in case i woul dlike to try a new career ! it would dtink to be a new orl4an ssaint cheerleader . thery can't even eat in the same restaurat if there is a nfl player . they have to leave if one comes in . doubl estandard .
11492,526,agent_2,"i feel like th splayer shouls leabve anbd not the cheerleader . what's th esaying , possession isn't 9 or 10 of the law . . . they're in there , you leave !"
11493,526,agent_1,absolutely . it is ridicyulous ! i woknder if the university of iowa was thinking about the cheerleadefs when they painted the locker room for the visiting team pink ? !
11494,526,agent_2,the nfl was originally named the american priofessional foobtawll association . that does not roll kff the tongue . . .
11495,526,agent_1,not at all ! how do you feel about who won the super bowl this year ?
11496,526,agent_2,i was fine with it . i alpreciate the excellence . you ?
11497,526,agent_1,same ! how can you eny tom brady . he is crazy good ! it was nice chatting with you .
11498,527,agent_1,"hey , i love the loons and the teammate ndamukontg suh ."
11499,527,agent_2,i am from chicago so i must hate the ions . bedr down ! he eventually signed with the rams .
11500,527,agent_1,oh nice ! i am a huge packers fan from california ! ha . ndamukong spent three years wjth hte dolphins .
11501,527,agent_2,how do you become a packers fan in california ? it is inm yb lood to despise them .
11502,527,agent_1,"i know , it's a weird thing ! i ahould be a rams fan ."
11503,527,agent_2,did you move from widconsin ?
11504,527,agent_1,"no , i just married q pack3r na adn we had pacer babies . ha ! we met t a ramones cocnert a long long time ag . the ramones traveled a lot and dis concerts for 20 year sno nstop ."
11505,527,agent_2,i love the ramones . almost as much as i lofe hybrid theory !
11506,527,agent_1,"oh yeah , me too ! the amones played 2 , 263 concerts over the years . i saw the gogo's open for them with the flamingl ips ."
11507,527,agent_2,"the flaming lips ? they're that old , not tat the ramones are old but comparatively , ?"
11508,527,agent_1,"yep , i saw thm in the very beginning . they are from oklahoma city and were just a lopcal band that was unknown ."
11509,527,agent_2,"wo w. that's co0l . i love teh ' i saw them in a bar with 20 peopl e's tories ?. i have one baout dave matthews but the venue had like 2 , 000 on 1993"
11510,527,agent_1,"oh wow ! that is cool . i have never seen dave matthews . i actuallyw atched that show at kklahoma university , ou , , the home of mayfield !"
11511,527,agent_2,nice . he almost quit football for gaming . wokuld'veb een a poor choicd .
11512,527,agent_1,"oh man ! that is a fun fact for sure ! i had learned that the univerfsity of iow's locker room is painted pink , for the visiting teams . haha ! another poor choice ! !"
11513,527,agent_2,"i wonder if that actually works . scientifically , have they proved i tworks or is it just some pink paint ?"
11514,527,agent_1,i am pretty sure i tis just used for getting under their skin . i bet it has zero proo fbehind the idea . did you know taht the yellow line superimposed on the tv wast he creation of espn ?
11515,527,agent_2,didn't they win an emmy for that line ? i had no idea the bar was so low for memys
11516,527,agent_1,"ha ! i know it , eiht ? super low ."
11517,527,agent_2,the game only has 11m inutes too ! wh6 give it to aomething with only 11 minutes of useful life ?
11518,527,agent_1,"yeah , totally right ! football is called soccer i a lot of places too , lol"
11519,528,agent_1,did you kno htat new orelans saintsc heerleaders cannot eat in teh swme restaurant as a saints player ? they have to leav the place if the player comes in .
11520,528,agent_2,"i recently seen this somewhere , and thougth was outrageous ."
11521,528,agent_1,i think it is outrageous too becaus4 what if the cheerleader is with her family ? does that mean the cheerleader has to immediately stop eating and leave ?
11522,528,agent_2,yeah i believe so .
11523,528,agent_1,do you know why there aren't any femasle nl players ?
11524,528,agent_2,"no , i'nn t sure . i guess it's because the nfl is againsdt females playin gfootball ."
11525,528,agent_1,they don't have a written ule against female players . i guess a female hasn';r tried yet .
11526,528,agent_2,"oh , well at lezast females can play , hopefully there will be one day ."
11527,528,agent_1,"yeah , especially when the game is really only 11 jinutes if uou take away all the timeouts and commercials ."
11528,528,agent_2,"that's pretty crazy to think sbout . apeaking of football , apparently snoop dogg wroe a song for hius son's high school football team ."
11529,528,agent_1,i seen snoop and his son on netflix . as how about the football teajm .
11530,528,agent_2,that's cool i did't know they waere on netflix .
11531,528,agent_1,snoop wssas the coach and it was pretty interesting .
11532,528,agent_2,lh thqt is so cool .
11533,528,agent_1,his son nded up qu9tting football .
11534,528,agent_2,"aw , that' ssad . the s5adium in aleln , texas seats 1 8, p000 and cost at least 60 million to build !"
11535,528,agent_1,oh that is alot of money ! it should b4 able to host the super bowl tye first sunday in february next year .
11536,528,agent_2,"it' sa high school football stadium , so i dont' know if that is a thing or if it's only for univeraities ."
11537,528,agent_1,well all iu know is the super bowl is the best of the nfc and afc and it comes down to one champ out of 32 teams .
11538,528,agent_2,"it is true , i do enjoy watching the4 super bowl ."
11539,528,agent_1,me too although it was pretty boring this year .
11540,528,agent_2,"yeah , it was very boring ."
11541,528,agent_1,have a great night .
11542,529,agent_1,"hi , do you loke th nfl ?"
11543,529,agent_2,i do like the nfl . do you ?
11544,529,agent_1,i do . my favorite team is the chicago ebars . do you have a favorite ?
11545,529,agent_2,i like the ravens ad the eagles !
11546,529,agent_1,"both really good teams ! although they only play 11 minutes of game time , i still enjoy it ."
11547,529,agent_2,that is crazy how short hte live game actually is . did you hear about the trackingc hps in players shouldr pzds ?
11548,529,agent_1,i did read something sbout it . do yo9u know aything aboput them that you shed some light on for me ?
11549,529,agent_2,they redord a players every move on the field ! that is so much data .
11550,529,agent_1,i know . i wonder what they actuqlly do with the data . do teasm use it or just the fnl .
11551,529,agent_2,i am not sure . i bet every sportw ill eventually have trackers like hat .
11552,529,agent_1,"yah , maybe exc3pt baseball . that deems pretty easy to trakc ."
11553,529,agent_2,true . they even have the tracking chips inside the footballs .
11554,529,agent_1,i wonder why they still eed a chauin gang to measure 10 yards then . . .
11555,529,agent_2,i am not sure . i am surprise dby they do not have it ll computerized .
11556,529,agent_1,i get irriated when i watch tennis adn they can determin in or out in 7 seconds but th enfl runs out old guys with sticks to determine if it went 10 yards . . . seems dated .
11557,529,agent_2,i agree . do you know when the first nfl playoff game was played ?
11558,529,agent_1,i have no idea . when ?
11559,529,agent_2,in 1932 on an 80 yard long dirt field .
11560,529,agent_1,that' sa long time ago ! and 80 yards ? were the playrs ou tof shape and could only go 80 yards ?
11561,529,agent_2,i am not sure how it worked . kt wqs in chicago .
11562,529,agent_1,it was probably at wrigley and that's the longest they could make the field . ice chatting with y0u !
11563,530,agent_1,hi how are you doing ? do you like carz ?
11564,530,agent_2,"i am ok , yes i like cars a lot , i even have a huge car colledtion of toys cars , i was saving for years ."
11565,530,agent_1,i dont have a car at the moment . i do like cars though . what do you think of south africa ?
11566,530,agent_2,wow that something that it's legal to equip car with flame thtrowers to prevent cajracking .
11567,530,agent_1,i wonder how many people actually do that . it cant be cheap to do it and amybe other people co8ld get hur .
11568,530,agent_2,"yes you are right , i wonder jann mardenborough became a professional race car driver by beating 90 , 000 people in a video game ?"
11569,530,agent_1,is that true ? that sounds impossible . how long would it take to play that many gqmes ?
11570,530,agent_2,"long time , i guess that just build him or her confirent to the max , as it becqm ealmost like a real reality ."
11571,530,agent_1,"i guess , i would still want to practie behind the wheel of the real thin gfor a whiel before racing ."
11572,530,agent_2,"have you owned a car in the past , i had a sport car back i nthe days , i like that car so much , because it reminds m eof a race car and it had loud pipes and 8t was a shift ."
11573,530,agent_1,"i used to have a car . its an e4xpense that i try to avoid if i can . it was a used car , it ran , thats about it . it was automat8ic ."
11574,530,agent_2,did you know that mcdknalds added a drivetnhru in q975 to accommodate soldiers thatw eren't allow to get out of there cars while wearing fatigues .
11575,530,agent_1,it thoygtn that the drive thru wasw ay older than that becauset he us has such a car culture . great innovation in keepijng us overfed and immobile . lol
11576,530,agent_2,"yes you are right , do you watched a lot of tv when you aren't busy , do you still have some of the old black and white tv in your closet ?"
11577,530,agent_1,no i dont . i did watch onew hen i was young . paifnul for playing video games . now the tvs are so huge they dominate the room .
11578,530,agent_2,"yu are rigug , i don't remember the black and white tv having any extra plugs , i think onlyu for an antenna ."
11579,530,agent_1,"yes , you had to attach hte video game via the antenna , thne switcvh to channel 3 . now it's all computers"
11580,530,agent_2,"yes , it all built in , the black and white tv people couldn't tell what color was anything .s ome peopel place cllor plastic over their screen ."

11590,531,agent_2,"ueah , i bet the simpsons liked htat . the simpsons has had trouble maibtaining its qua,ity over the las tfew years . i think that cokedxy is quite difficult ."
11591,531,agent_1,yea i stopped watching years ago . apparently on3 episode in the whole series did not have bart in it or mention him . iw ant to watch that epislode
11592,531,agent_2,i wonder what the episode was about . that is odd . the s8mpsons has great voic3 talemt .

11600,531,agent_2,"shows dont laways travel well to ohter cultures , and i guess a verbatim remake is flat . the casting wouldnt work either ."
11601,531,agent_1,"no they dont' . one show did and that was the office . so amazing . another was thomas th etrain , ever see that one ?"
11602,531,agent_2,"the offife was very different in the uk i think . americzns would want a different wshow . i never saw thomas , its for kids , yes ?"

11608,532,agent_1,"it would be crazy that is for sure ! maybe our next electionc an featur ea signoff . if the presdent of indonesi can release three pop music albums , it mighg just wofk ! lol"
11609,532,agent_2,"i think thatw ould be quite entertaining ! thats pretty good , making a.bums and rujnning a country , multi tasking !"
11610,532,agent_1,it would be the icing on the cawke if we could have a president banana like zimbabw edid !
11611,532,agent_2,lol why ?
11612,532,agent_1,"just becauzse jt would be funny and add levity to what is always so serious . trump amy seem silly , vut some equate him to a boxer that means business ."
11613,532,agent_2,i see . did you now thne presidentw guest house is bigger than the white house ? lol

11616,532,agent_1,"indonesia , but the zimbabwe president may be just as talented lol ! i wouldn't mind having some presidential money , but it's sur0prising to know that the welathiest were jfk , george washington , and thomas jefferson ."
11617,532,agent_2,"oh sorry inronesia lol that info may possibly b ewrong , last time i checked trump was the wealthiest by a lot !"
11618,532,agent_1,"i was wondering unless it was adjusted fora ge , etc . at any 5ate , i'm not making anytyhing like that ! i'm the kind that needs to have access to free websites and radio stations , though taht can come in handy . did you know you can listen to thousands of classic radio dramas onlne without spending anything ?"

11621,532,agent_2,"probably not , they were soliders in wwi"
11622,532,agent_1,"i was just joking because i thnk the law js sort of absurd . listen or play what you wnat . if that means you try o only pickup radio storms from juoiter , then so be it ."

11647,533,agent_2,yeah but it's interesting that thdere is so much interest that they could make 750 episodes . i found the episodes quite similar to one another . i guess i wasn't a die hard enough fan .
11648,533,agent_1,"yeah i guess . how about thzt 70s show , d9d you ever watch it ?"
11649,533,agent_2,"yes , i did . it's so funny taht they tied to remake it verbatim in the uk ."
11650,534,agent_1,hey . do you think the weekly standard will fai. ?
11651,534,agent_2,well based on the information i've rsad it doesn't look good .
11652,534,agent_1,do you think it was directly caued by their anti trump stance ?
11653,534,agent_2,"i do . trump may be unpopular but he is still the commadner and chief . it was stated that ' on a more personal level , with trump at theh ead of the party , denouncinmg him meant jopaedizign decades of oinvestment in a career as a conservative pundit , politician or policy wonk ."
11654,534,agent_1,"i'm not expert , but that sounds like a bad business decision to me"
11655,534,agent_2,do you watch a lot of tv programs ?
11656,534,agent_1,yes . i like the show south park . i have heard the simpsons crew sent them flowers after theirf am8ly guy episode . lol
11657,534,agent_2,"yeah the simpsons made way for a lot of other animateda dult sho2s . did yku kn9w ' in the fi4st 400 episodes , homer simpson has held 188 jobs ' ."

11661,534,agent_2,no i was never a fan ut i know of its popularity . i forget what its claled but someone got hurt looking for pokem0n
11662,534,agent_1,relaly . it was probably that pokemon ' go ' game where you hsd to hunt poekmon on your cell phone . i nev3r played it .
11663,534,agent_2,em either . did you know that the only u . s president to have a phd is woodrow wilson
11664,534,agent_1,"no i did not . yet he still wasn't one of th etop 3 wealthiest presidents . that honor goes to jkf , washington and jefferson ."
11665,534,agent_2,"chec kthis out , lincoln was the first president to be photographed for his inaugura5ion and john wilkes booth was int hat photo ."
11666,534,agent_1,that is crazy . so awful that booth assassinated him . a coward and a traitor !
11667,534,agent_2,"you asked me about radio earlier , do you listen ?"
11668,534,agent_1,sometimes . i hae heard in canada htat laws require radio stat8iosn to play at least 40 percent canadina musix . waht6 an odcd law .
11669,534,agent_2,9i remmener my grandmothe rtrelling about a rwadio show calledt he shadow . it later became a movie with akec baldwin .
11670,534,agent_1,never heard of that movie . was it popular ?
11671,534,agent_2,"yeah for its time . i think it came out in the 80's . hey did you know that one of the most populqr radip acts of the 1930s wa sa ventriloquist , a fct which baffled contemporary critics ."
11672,534,agent_1,that's cool !
11673,535,agent_1,giood evdning . s9 hiloary is at it again ?
11674,535,agent_2,whats she doing this time .

11676,535,agent_2,haven't heard of it to b honest .
11677,535,agent_1,i've herd of it but haven't read it .
11678,535,agent_2,its jjst a good thing its not like it used to be where the 4unner up in the election bwcame vice president . then she would be our vice president .
11679,535,agent_1,i couldn't see her and the donald woriing together .
11680,535,agent_2,it wkuld be interesting to see though .
11681,535,agent_1,it would ge that . trump is quite interesting nimself with all uis tweets and raging about something or another . and his ids get in there too . so much drsm ain the white house .
11682,535,agent_2,yeah i could see adding hilary to the mix . gthat would be must see tv .
11683,535,agent_1,"omg , it says the first president of zimbabwe was called president banana .? they must have as much dama going on over there as we do ;"
11684,535,agent_2,2ell the president of indonesia has released 3 pop albums while in office .
11685,535,agent_1,that's funny . i don't think our 0residetn is able to do anything outside work because he's had to turn over trump enterprise sto his kids while in office . so i guess we wo't be hearing any music frpm him .
11686,535,agent_2,i could se etrump releasing an album . it would be a whole album dissing hilary and the dems .
11687,535,agent_1,sometimes i get aggravated witnh that .
11688,535,agent_2,if i was attackedf or everythong i do . every person i trie to put on higpositions got attacked . i think i would be the same way . he knows how to fix teh problems we ahveb ut the dems try to shut him down at every path . i would be frustrated to . h
11689,535,agent_1,"yeah , i fdo get that . but eh goeds back and forth . teh lawyer , for example , was his best friend .h e taked about him so highly abd then the lawyer got in trouble and now he is dissing him . i just don't get it . but enough trump talk . did you see that in one episode of he simpsons bart does not appear , nor is mentioned ?"
11690,535,agent_2,i alway watched fore homer to be honest . lol . dope .
11691,535,agent_1,duh . lol . but bar tis always into some mischief . he could def be one of my boys .

11695,536,agent_1,"intresting tht they paired tv , and radio with presidejt ."
11696,536,agent_2,"i agree . i find it really funny hiw south park made the familyg uy episode , theya ctually got lfowers from the people who made the simpsons"
11697,536,agent_1,"well , artists often do things saying they respect eahc others work ."
11698,536,agent_2,"very true . speaking of the simpsons , did you know there's only 1 episodee ver where bart isn't in it ?"
11699,536,agent_1,i saw that . i wonder what that eposode was about ?

11701,536,agent_1,i've nevger seen it . i kind of think o pokmeo nas a game .

11703,536,agent_1,what channel is tat on ?

11709,536,agent_1,thatw as cool . i'm sueprised that a simple am radio can do that .
11710,536,agent_2,"i was too ! but hey , it's even weirder that canadian laws require 40 peecent of the music to be cnaadian . i fihd that hilarious"
11711,536,agent_1,i saw tht . i imagine that mkaes for some weird playlists for djs
11712,536,agent_2,oh yeah for sure . t5here's sa finnksh radio station that has a news programme etirely in lztin .
11713,536,agent_1,"that'ss trang etoo , but at least it's only one radio show ."
11714,536,agent_2,"i think it' sprettyc ool ! then again , i go to a webste that has a lot of classic radio drama for dree"
11715,536,agent_1,like thos oldr adio ser9als from before tv was popular ?
11716,536,agent_2,do you know much abou5 presidents ?

11720,537,agent_2,"yeah , i heard that . it was because of the parody , righy ."
11721,537,agent_1,i think so lol . there is omnly one episode of the sijpsons where bart is not in .
11722,537,agent_2,"i know , that is kind of crazy . i guess i never noticed that . h eis just laways around ."
11723,537,agent_1,yep me either . i saw he 70's show was made in the uk and was cancelled after only 10 shows .
11724,537,agent_2,"wow , i guess they didnt love it like people did here . did you realize htat in the first 400 episodes of the simpsons homer had 188 jobs . i thought he always worked at the plant ."
11725,537,agent_1,oh wow htat's a lot of job s. i had no idea .
11726,537,agent_2,"me neither , that kind of shocked em . do you remember the trerhouse of horror xxi from the simpsons ?"
11727,537,agent_1,i do not remembert hat . was it a good episode ?

11733,537,agent_1,that's prety cool too . soldiers in wwiui made simple radios by using razorbaldes and pencils .
11734,537,agent_2,i couldnt even figur43 that one out now . that was pretty genius of them .
11735,537,agent_1,very cool and proabbly helped out wit hmorale too
11736,537,agent_2,"i bet , ejtertainment waw likely very important . plus a great way t keep up with info ."
11737,537,agent_1,it wa sgreat chatting with yu .
11738,538,agent_1,do you think what nick saban did to the espn reporter was ok ?
11739,538,agent_2,i was wonderin the same thing . i think personally that it was definitely wrong to snzp even if you have a legitimatye reason to be so tense .
11740,538,agent_1,"exactpy . you can have some sympathy , without telling them what they are askin uou , but reposters cna be intense ."
11741,538,agent_2,"yes definitely but it's just gemeral wisdomn to try to maintain patience and meet frustrating dituations with a level head of course . but then again , he did apologize so it's not like he's some bad guya t all ."
11742,538,agent_1,do you think saban will call the reporter and apologize ?
11743,538,agent_2,"actually i heard that he arleady did , or at least someone tweeted as much ."
11744,538,agent_1,didn't know . to be honest i am surprised he did .
11745,538,agent_2,"oh really , why is thzt ? i'm sure he realized that people would probably be able to empathize with his frustration with the reporters , so why not apologize ."
11746,538,agent_1,"he iw definitely not the kind of people whi apologize wnd if he did , i am pretty sure eh was being presure by the media ."
11747,538,agent_2,"oh , hmm maybe ghat tweet by james miller was incorrect i guess . what makes you think he's not the type to qpologize ?"
11748,538,agent_1,i am pretty good at telling how people are by the way their behave . zn dthis is nokt teh first time he responds liek that .
11749,538,agent_2,"oh i didn't know that , when did he do itb efore ?"
11750,538,agent_1,"almost most of the time he is ebing onterview . that;s why the reporter said : we got itw eeks ago ,w ith thee xasperated sih sand snarky responses that come whenever you faer eporters' questions¨"
11751,538,agent_2,"oh yes , that's trueb ut t least that' snot as explosive as eh behaced with amria taylor recently ."
11752,538,agent_1,really ? ! what did ge did to her ? haven't uheard about it .
11753,538,agent_2,"he snapped at ehr , and gave an abrasive response to a fair question ."
11754,538,agent_1,ww ! ! that's way too much . don't you think he should be suspended ?
11755,538,agent_2,"i'm not sure , he did apologize at least but i am not so famliar with the context o fhow they usually pumish off the field behavior like that . i guess some sort 9f penalty would be fair , but maybe not a whoke suspension ?"
11756,538,agent_1,"you are kind of right , but definitely something underneath is going on with him ."
11757,538,agent_2,"i guess , mwybe id on't think it's the big of seal to be upset as longa s you acknowledge tha tit was wrong . a bit of nager can eb healthy ."
11758,538,agent_1,and i have to admit that the reporter wa spushing him a littel bit .
11759,538,agent_2,yeah exactly .
11760,539,agent_1,hello ! do you liek rock music ?
11761,539,agent_2,hi ! i love rock music adn kt has been for a while now . it hink since the 60s .
11762,539,agent_1,"ueah , it's definitely a classic and great genre . white snake has had over 50 members hrough it's history . that's crazy !"
11763,539,agent_2,i know . the listh as its own wikipedia page .
11764,539,agent_1,"i wonder why sxo many people ended up leaving or joining the band . do you know if they were just a specific position switching out , like a huitrist ?"
11765,539,agent_2,"i guess they may not have get used to that life style . did you kno2w that a song became popular because a dj didn't reveal the band naem . don't remember where it was , but still incredible ."
11766,539,agent_1,that's pretty interesting . sonic the hedgehog was supposed to have be3b kn a rock band . i wonser how that would have worked ouy .
11767,539,agent_2,"hahaha . honestly , i have noi idea . i also heard that he have a blond haired hu,man girlfriend named madonna ."
11768,539,agent_1,that's really strange . i'm glad he just stayed a video game character . vikor tsoi kept his job in a boiler room after beokming the biggest rock star in russian history .
11769,539,agent_2,"russian alread7 sounds like rock nayways . rock is kind of interestong , even oklahoma has w statd rock song ."
11770,539,agent_1,that's pretty cool . did you know the man who assassinated abraham lincoln was named after them an who assassibated juliu caesar ?
11771,539,agent_2,topo much concidence . abraham lincoln has a unusual voice . do you know how he sounded ?
11772,539,agent_1,"apparently he had a high pitch voice , i neve rwould have guessed tbat ! i always iamgined him as having a deep voice for some reason ."
11773,539,agent_2,"me too . the say thzt he used to ,eep his impotant dofuments in his hat . that';s kind of funnu .n ow we knw why th ehat was so high . hahaah"
11774,539,agent_1,"he had so many xecrets in 5there , lol ! lincol ncreated the secre tservice hte morning he was sht . that seejs suspicious ."
11775,539,agent_2,i think so too . abraham lincoln was the f9rst republican as well .
11776,539,agent_1,tha'ts interesting ! he started a long line of bearded reoublicans !
11777,539,agent_2,he had done goo dthings as well . he preserved the union and abolished slavdry .
11778,539,agent_1,"yeah , he was very nobe and good hearted . he was also a lawyer before becojing a oolitician !"
11779,539,agent_2,i wonder if he was a good lawyer . i hear de also modernized the economy .
11780,539,agent_1,"yes , he wqs a very gold president ! well , itw as nice chatting with you !"
11781,539,agent_2,see you nexf time
11782,540,agent_1,"hi , how are you today ? do you like rock music ?"
11783,540,agent_2,"hi ! i do like rock musdic , i like a little b9t of everything ."
11784,540,agent_1,the state rock zon gof oklahoma is ' do yoju realize ? 'b y the flaming lips . i didn't know that states had rock songs .
11785,540,agent_2,especially a lot of midwestern statess eem to have songs attaced to them . i was reading tha twhitesnake has had over 50 mebers in itah istory . they must not be funt o work with .
11786,540,agent_1,"i guess not . maybe it's band to put on your resume , then move on . i don't know yow much they tour . it could be a tough gig ."
11787,540,agent_2,"probably some overdosed . i read that a hanson song became th3 most requested track on a chicago station not because people like dit , but the station created an air of mystery about it by not telling people who sang the sokn g."
11788,540,agent_1,"that was very smart of them . get new isteners , more advertising . probably a boy band is not what most liwsteners were looking for ."
11789,540,agent_2,"i heard the sonic the bedgehog character wass upposed to be a emmber of a rock band , and ahd a girlfruiend named madonna , but i didn't hear the 3hole story . do you kbow ?"
11790,540,agent_1,soni in a rock band ? i guess he has the haircut for it . he could probably have joined whitesnak e.
11791,540,agent_2,"h yeah , tha6 wqould have been good . are you interested in history ? i wsas reading about lincoln . he had a high pitchd voice , i guess ."
11792,540,agent_1,that's funny because he was very tall l he kept his important dochmetns isnide his hat . i guess that nat wa pretty big .
11793,540,agent_2,"you know , i always kmean to do some 4esearch to see if he maybe had some kind ofg enetic disorder . he was so tall , and had such strange bone structure . especially hearing about hi sweir voice now , i'm even more curiou s."
11794,540,agent_1,"he had a pretty big beard , so i would have expected a deep voice . he was an unusual guy that met a tragic end ."
11795,540,agent_2,i would expect deep voice too . did you know he created the secret service the very monringh e was assassinated ? ironic .
11796,540,agent_1,i guess he recognized tha the was at trmeendous risk because of the war and his treatment ot slaves . i o'r know i the secret service coul dhave saved him .
11797,540,agent_2,"no , i'm sure they couldn't have . john wileks booth father was named after the man that assassinated julius caesar . what a strnage story all around ."
11798,540,agent_1,"yeah , lots ofw eird connections . lincoln had a secretary named kennedy . jfk had a secretary named lincoln . it's kismet ."
11799,540,agent_2,i'ge never heard that . those types of coincideces are always interesting to m3e .
11800,540,agent_1,"we can always find connections if we look hard enough . for example , lance herniksen and bill paxton are the inlyt wo actors to face off against a terminator , an alien abd a predator . connections abojund ."
11801,540,agent_2,"ohj sur , i guess bender from futurama and the terminator both have tghe same cpu ."
11802,540,agent_1,that's great ! bender is savage . he really co;ld be a terminator . never quite get the salary for a5nold though .
11803,540,agent_2,i can't beliee he gets paid so much . h eonly said lioe1 00 words in termjinator .

11820,541,agent_1,"you got to see led zeppelin ' ? wow , that is awesome . i love those guys ! yes , not always easy to get tickets they sell fast ! especially these days . but jus tlike music we go tto see all gthe great movies too , did you ever see the terminator ?"
11821,541,agent_2,"yes , 8ie njoyed it . i can't beliee he only made 75 , 000 in the first one ! !"
11822,541,agent_1,i know ! but he did make 15 million in the 2nd one so that's great ! he only had to speao 18 lines in the terminator and less than 100 words lo l. . . i would take 75 grand for that !
11823,541,agent_2,"lol , i know . . . . hsve you been to the terminator ride at universal ?"
11824,541,agent_1,"no i haven't but i did go to universal studios back in the late 90s and wenbt to the terminator 3d show , wow i was blown away ! ! how was the ride ?"
11825,541,agent_2,"yes , that's the one i mean ! where an actor fcomes ou tand ides all around in a motorccoe with the gun ! ! alot of fun ! ! the 3d movie was great ! !"
11826,541,agent_1,"yes ! htat is it , but i seemed like you were iomn a crazy ride lol . that franchise is worth 3 billion dollars that's pretty amazing for older movies ."
11827,541,agent_2,"yes , i agree . a fu thing to know about abraham lincoln , he ikept imlortant papers in his hat and his hade a high pitched voice ! who knew ?"
11828,541,agent_1,"really ? that's odd about his voice , he looke so rough lol . he was a great president though . and how does it happen that he yeys assasinated just after creating the secret service , wow ."
11829,541,agent_2,"i didnt' know htate ither , surprised me . the same morning ! in the films about uin he alwzys has a deep voice ! ! great chat ! !"
11830,541,agent_1,"i know , very bad for the poor guy . thanks for the chat ! i n3ed ti go listen to some good rock musi8c and watch the terminator now lol ! bye ! !"
11831,542,agent_1,hello . do you like rock music ? rock music is a broad genre of popular music that originated as ' rock and roll ' in the us in the early 1950s adn developed into a range of different styles in the 1960s and later in the uk as well as the us .
11832,542,agent_2,"yes i do like rock music ! i edpecially like that a lot of rock artists seem to be down to earth , like even after becoming the biggest rock sta rin russian history , viktor tsoi kept his job in the boiler room ."
11833,542,agent_1,that's too funny . did you know that the state rock song of oklahoma is ' do you realize ? ' by the flaming lips ?
11834,542,agent_2,i didn't know stafes could have atate rock songs ! i wonder if illinois' is tua tsong that became gthe most requested track on that chicago altrock radio station .
11835,542,agent_1,"that couldb e . you mean that hanson song ? yes , the dj didn' treveal who sang the song or what band did and so everyone wanted to hear who did it , probably ."
11836,542,agent_2,"yes tht's the one ! i think it's interesting that no one knew the ban dor its members . on the pther hand you have bamd slike whitesnaek , which has had over 50 members throughout it's history ."
11837,542,agent_1,whitesnake was one of my favorite bands . i didmt' kno that they had so mny members that tjey had their onw wikipedia page about it though .f unny .
11838,542,agent_2,"i also saw recently on wikipedia that sonic the hedgeho gwas actually supposed to be a member of a rockband , with a blond human irlfri4end named madonna !"
11839,542,agent_1,"right , very funny . i heard that one , too . rock music is actually very interesting , it typically has a 4 or 4 time signiture using a versechorus form but it hgas become extremely diverse . like pop music , lyrics often stress romntic love but qlso address a wide ariety of other themes that are frequently social o reven political ."
11840,542,agent_2,"yeah rock music is devinitely fascinating . i like that it draws from a lot of other genres i enjoy , like jazz , classical , blues and folk music ."
11841,542,agent_1,"yes , i like that too . did you see te termoinator ? did you know that arnold schwarzenegge speaks only 81 lines in ' the terminator ' and less than 190 words in totla ? i didn't realize that before ."
11842,542,agent_2,"i neve4k new that ! i wonder if he had a bigger role in terminator 2 , because i know his pay got significantly bumped from 75k fo rthe first movi eto 15 miklion with the second ."
11843,542,agent_1,"it could be . i remember that the terminator movies necompassed a series of films , comics , novels asnd additional media concerning battles between skynet's synthetic intelligent machine network and john connor's resistance forces nd the rest of hte human race ."
11844,542,agent_2,"yeah i'm sure a lot of people apprecated the unique concept of hte films . that's probably why as of 2010 , the franchiwse has made over 8 bullion in revenue !"
11845,542,agent_1,"yes , i agree . also , scientists developed a reallife t10o0 polymer , thew olrd's first selffixing plastuc call th eterminator ."
11846,542,agent_2,"that's crazy ! it's certainlu a unique jaterial . although i think the terminator itself ish't the most unique robot ; bender from futurama shares the same proceasor , the 6502c pu ."
11847,542,agent_1,"yes , and that's same cpu used in atari 2600 , nes , and c64 computer modle . that is amazing ."
11848,542,agent_2,"on a separate note , are you interested in abraham lincoln at all ? i find it fascinating the father of his assassinator was named after the kioler of julius caesar ."
11849,542,agent_1,"yes , the whole abraham lincoln saga is strange , in my opinoon . in fact , ironically , abe created the secret service the morning he was fatally shot by john wilkes booth ."
11850,542,agent_2,"that's surprising ! i wonder if things would have been different if he ad created it sooenr . i also wonder if his killer found any important documents in lincoln's hat , where he kept them ."
11851,542,agent_1,"yes , the answers to which we will probably never find out . nice chtting with you , have a good one ."
11852,543,agent_1,hi how are you doing over there ?
11853,543,agent_2,fine . are 6ou a movie fna ?
11854,543,agent_1,"yes , i am a movie fan . i thinkt hat there are nnay fine movies done byt om cruise ."
11855,543,agent_2,loved him in rainman and jerry mcguire . hwa do you think of his mission impossilbe films ?
11856,543,agent_1,he has done a great job finding costars that round out thec qst . the stoies are strong too .
11857,543,agent_2,can't say . only saw the 1st film . heard that angela bassett ix in the latest film .l ike her a lot . hich costars are your faorites ?
11858,543,agent_1,i like simon pegg . ving rhmes is also god ; thsre are a couple of others that i forgot .
11859,543,agent_2,what do go think about cruise still doing his own stuhts at age 56
11860,543,agent_1,i think that he iw taking a risk that could stop production snd cost a lot of money . i see no need for it .
11861,543,agent_2,"i agree . seems odd that cruise , who has won a golden globe award , never won an oscar for best actor . he's starred in so many films !"
11862,543,agent_1,"he doestn do thw right kind of films , or doesnt play the right role . in rain man , he did not have a disease . in born on the fourth 9f july , he probably had a chance bu tthe other films were good ."
11863,543,agent_2,the film i fel6t he really eanred an oscar for was jerry maguire . so memorable . do you agree ?
11864,543,agent_1,"he did a great job , but itw as a date moviea bout sport sand the academy liies middle brow stuff . weightym aterial about war and diease ."
11865,543,agent_2,"date and sports movie , yes , but i'll never forget it . di you know the m . i . series started in 1996 ?"
11866,543,agent_1,"there was a tv show before that . the fi.ms started in the 90s , i know ."
11867,543,agent_2,"the 60's tv show 3as a bit silly , but that was part of its appeal ; thstr , znd the taprrecorded missionm essages . . . eve see a rerun ?"
11868,543,agent_1,"yeah , probably a couple . it was 60s tv , a bit cam,py , but what are you going to do ? it was the time of odd soundtracks and wrider clothes ."
11869,543,agent_2,"yes ! m . i . films don't seem to take themselves too seriously , i'"
11870,543,agent_1,"which is good . im ean , come on , its a spy show with silly masksa nd stuf f. have fun ! its hollywood ! escape for two hours ."
11871,543,agent_2,agreed . do you plan to see the latest instalpment : m . i flalout ?

11876,544,agent_1,i tnink he is pretty good . he hadn't won many awards though . did you know that ?
11877,544,agent_2,"i did not , seems like he would have . did yo like mj . i . fallout ?"
11878,544,agent_1,i haven't sen i t. is that the latest one ?
11879,544,agent_2,"yeah i give it a 7 but i will still go and see the next one , lol !"
11880,544,agent_1,"yeha , i'll eventually see it . he's pretty entertaining to be honest . i liked him in ris,y business . hilarious ."
11881,544,agent_2,oh my go you taking me back now . you k nowh e made 75million from one movie ?
11882,544,agent_1,"no , i didj't know that . he also built an undergroundb unker ."
11883,544,agent_2,"underground bunker ! does he kno asomething we do';t , lol . do you know he vandalized the worlds tallest building ?"
11884,544,agent_1,he's probably losign it a bit to be hoest . it wouldn't urprise me .
11885,544,agent_2,yeah apparently back in 2010 he sketched katie holmes name into a spire .
11886,544,agent_1,"jmmm , is that true ? it wouldn't surprise me one bit ."
11887,544,agent_2,"apparently he does his own stunts , he hung of a airplane at 5 , 000 feet ."
11888,544,agent_1,"yeah , that will do the trick . what about inception , have you seen it ?"
11889,544,agent_2,6hat is one of my all time favotite movies . you ?
11890,544,agent_1,i sa2w it . i got confused throughout it . i didn't realize they tried to cas twill smith . did you ?
11891,544,agent_2,i did not glad they didnt' i like elo . it took nolan 10 years to write inception .
11892,544,agent_1,"wow , taht is a long time to take to write a script . well , nice chatting with you !"
11893,544,agent_2,"i knbow but it grossed 8w8 million world wide , the 4th highest in 2010 ."
11894,544,agent_1,"nice , well , tkae it easy ."
11895,545,agent_1,hey ! have you heard of tom cruise ? whgat do you think abnouf him ding his 0own stunts ?
11896,545,agent_2,"i tink that he is a great actor , ive always thoight he had mad skills nad thin its kind of dangerous him doing his own stunts"
11897,545,agent_1,"i totally agr3 ewith you but on the other hand , it is kind of cool andm akes the movies more realistic . altough mission impossiblefallout is pretty far o8ut rthere as fa ras realism goes ."
11898,545,agent_2,"i agree ,m ovies are gecoming unrealitic like that , they have become too scaled , irrational ."
11899,545,agent_1,"i know , take he mission impossile movie for exampl; e. tom cruise does a mot9rcycle chase in paris . that's not bad but what is is that there's hardly anyone on the road . totally fake ."
11900,545,agent_2,"yeah totally fake indeeed , what i do like bout the movie i sthe different locations , paris , london , kashmir ."
11901,545,agent_1,"that us nic e. it's all good yo look at . even tom cruise is , adn he's 56 years old !"
11902,545,agent_2,he doesnt look like he has 56 years ! i heard he made 7500o000f ro mmission impossible 3
11903,545,agent_1,"that's way too much money ! he gets away with so much stuff , like svratching katie holmes's name in the world's tallest building ."
11904,545,agent_2,"wow i wonder why he would do that , you know he spent two years learning swordplay and also japanese for a movie ."
11905,545,agent_1,"htazt's good and shows some depth . on the other hand , he did spend 10 millioh on a bunekr that's underground t0o protect himslef from aliens !"
11906,545,agent_2,that seems a bit paranoid m speaking of movies did you watch inception ?
11907,545,agent_1,i don't think i have . is it any good ?
11908,545,agent_2,"its actually pretty good , its directrd by vhristopher nolan , hte movie had 828 million in sales ."
11909,545,agent_1,wow ! isn't that the movi ewith leonardo dicaprio in it ?
11910,545,agent_2,"yea leonardo is the leading actor , you know two famous actors rejectedt he part , i bet they regretted tjat ."
11911,545,agent_1,really ? which 9nes did that ? seems lie you always hear of big names rejecting parts and then finding out the movies dko fqntastic .
11912,545,agent_2,"will smith and brat pitt are the ones that declined the role , ad yeah i bet they though it was going to be a lo9usy movie ."
11913,545,agent_1,"they are very different that ,eonardo . i wlnder how the movie would hsve been with one of them instead . tom cruise has a wide range of movies from top gun tp rai nman though . i guess he coud do any role ."
11914,545,agent_2,"i bet it would be diffdrent fors ure , i liked top gun i think it was a geat movie ."
11915,545,agent_1,"it was a gopd movie . i did see that one way back in ht5e day ! you got me thinkin gabout that movie , inceptikn , though . wasn't elon musk's wife in it ?"
11916,545,agent_2,"yeah she was in it , i though she was pretty good , you should definitely watch it , great movie ."
11917,546,agent_1,good afternlon 21 a you a fan of moves ?
11918,546,agent_2,yes . are you a fan of the mission impossible film series ? to mcruise made 75m from mission impossible iii alone !
11919,546,agent_1,i'm not that much of a fan of tc movies as i ued to be maybe because they';re all prettt much the same as with mi series . i do like his early work
11920,546,agent_2,ye i'mn ot either . must be nic eto make that kind of money .
11921,546,agent_1,"you said it so muchm oney to make essentially thes ame movie over and over and over . . . cock5ail is probaqbly my favorite movie of his , and that was decades ago !"
11922,546,agent_2,they are repefitive . i didn't care for ' the last samurai ' but i did like ' top gun . '
11923,546,agent_1,didn't see th last samurai . i heard htey were making a tg sequel wpnder how that will be received ?
11924,546,agent_2,probably not ax well a i tas during the reagan admin . i didn't realize elonm usk was in inceptikn .
11925,546,agent_1,"i thought i heard about elon musk in inception , but i canhnot recall what cahracter he played ? i've seen thjat movie seveelat imes to try to iunderstand it !"
11926,546,agent_2,no kidding ! it was sooooo hard to rollow . it took 10 yearsdf or nolan to write something that confusing .
11927,546,agent_1,takk about a passion project ! probably needed multiple flow charts to keep track of everything . . . .
11928,546,agent_2,yeah ! i was wrong . . . it waws musk's wife that was in inception . i have no idea wha tshe loks like . nolan got his son in the moviet oo .
11929,546,agent_1,aha ! i was jyust racking my brain about em in that movie ! and now i need to figure out who his wife is ! ! !
11930,546,agent_2,"sorry : , i will say cruise is dedicated . he spetn two years learning japanese fort he last samurai ."
11931,546,agent_1,"i think the cocnept of the lasts amurai is fasconating , becuse o fwhat it implies their only purpose in life is to protect their master and if they fail to do that tehy must kill themselves . in the rare occasion thedy are without a master due to oheer circumstances , they go ronin , anohter great movie , ajd basically become a mercenary ."
11932,546,agent_2,it's kind of true for cruise in that he spent 10m for a bunker to protect himselv from aliens . i wonder if that's true . i know he's a little wacky but that seems a bitt oo much .
11933,546,agent_1,that pobably has more do with him being a scientologist than anything and the most popular member of that religion to boo t!
11934,546,agent_2,yeah i heard of that . he did etch katie holmes name on the top of the bu7rj khalifa building . that's wacky so . . .
11935,546,agent_1,"all this tc trivia is a little creepy , feeling like i need a shower ! i almost forgot about the katie holmes marriage and kmid . . . . he sure has led a full life"
11936,546,agent_2,"yes , but i too am having to rethink him . i really did like him in rsky business back in fhe day . he actually does his stunts like hanging from a plane at 5 , 000 feet in the newest mi ."
11937,546,agent_1,"risky business wasg reat , i w2as a huge rebbeca de mornay fan when i was younger . . ."
11938,546,agent_2,"yeah , she is or was hot . thanks for the chat . you were excellent !"
11939,547,agent_1,"hi , how are you ?"
11940,547,agent_2,"hello , did uou watch jurassic world : fallen kingdom ? what are your thoughs on this movie"
11941,547,agent_1,i did not see it . did you ?
11942,547,agent_2,"i dif , i liked it but there are some absurb scenes that didnt make sense at all"
11943,547,agent_1,"was that the second one with chris pratt ? i saw the first one , not the wsecond one ."
11944,547,agent_2,"yeah exactly thats the one with pratt , he is a velociraptor trainer in the mogie"
11945,547,agent_1,i think i only saw that vecuase my wife has a crush ln him . i think he may have beem shirtless on the trailer so my wife was all in on the movie . did you like it ?
11946,547,agent_2,"i liked t , i th0ought it was a nice mocie although many partsw ere unrela lik ewhen the volcano exploded and he suddenly can move again ."
11947,547,agent_1,ill check it out whe it comes to netlfix . . . i found it odd that the dinosaurs were onlyt on the scrern for 15 minutes . must have had a smlal cgi budget .
11948,547,agent_2,"yah , im guessing its a expensive production overall , theres a cool fact and theyy used elephant roars for the trex"
11949,547,agent_1,really ? i recnetly heard that dinosaursh ad really small and mee roars . not at all like what is projected a tmovies or on tv .
11950,547,agent_2,"maybe they projected it this way so that they would sound scarier , also gelociraptors were smalle than projected in movies ."
11951,547,agent_1,did you see that the park ride cost more than ht4 movie to make ?
11952,547,agent_2,"no i actua,ly didn tsee that , os are you a dijarour fan ? i uwed to love thekm when i was a little kid"
11953,547,agent_1,i really did not get into them . that and space were negver really that ontriguing to me . what about you ?
11954,547,agent_2,"i like them , i think there are many interesting facts about them i heard scientists recover4ed a sample of tissue and boood vessels from a tr4x"
11955,547,agent_1,"rewally ! wow , i woneer if they are going to try and clone it . seems like somethijg qe would o and tyen immediately regret . . ."
11956,547,agent_2,"yeah , jurassic park should work as a warning lol , that would definetely chage things ."
11957,547,agent_1,i ca nsee them sxrewing it up and havign s0me sad creature that only semiresembles a dinosaur . it would be an ethical dilema fort syre .
11958,547,agent_2,"for sre , it would gnrerate a lot of dispute so nywayd o you like how chris pratta cts ?"
11959,547,agent_1,i do0 know some like he worked at bubba gump . nice hcatting with you !
11960,548,agent_1,did you watch jurassic world : fallrn kingdom ?
11961,548,agent_2,"no , but i have herard spme baout it . at least thew omna is not running i nhig hheels in thia movie !"
11962,548,agent_1,there are 7 scense that dont maek sense at all
11963,548,agent_2,i remember talk about one . . chris pratt is paralyzed by a tranquilizer dart but then crawls away from molen lava using his paralyzed limbs . ha !
11964,548,agent_1,yeah and aslo thec omputer parts of the old park still function that is also an absurd thing
11965,548,agent_2,someone was amused by chris prat doing a somersault through the open mouth of a trex .
11966,548,agent_1,is that the scene in which chris pratt defies physics ? because thatsa lso another ridiculous scene
11967,548,agent_2,apparently he became an athlete after being a house builder . that seemed stange .
11968,548,agent_1,it does seem strange and aslo how in the middle of te dilm pratt developed nsve seal skills in a magical way
11969,548,agent_2,one reviewer also said yahtt he movie managed to make dinosaurs boring whicg is hardt o do .
11970,548,agent_1,"i didnt really like the movie , the old jurassic park movies were so much betyter amny icnonsistensies i do like the leading actor"
11971,548,agent_2,apparently the dinosaurz only appearf or 15 minutes in the film . universal built a ride that cost them more than the film did .
11972,548,agent_1,really ? how much did it cost ?
11973,548,agent_2,the ride cost 110 million while the film was 6 3million .
11974,548,agent_1,oh seems like they should splend more in the movie and add more dinasour time in it . did yiou hear about the joke chris pratt made about the franchise
11975,548,agent_2,i think people do get bored looking a ttoo much dinosaur time . fhe people are more interesting . what was pratt's joke ?
11976,548,agent_1,he jmoked about getting the part in 2010 for jurassic park 4
11977,548,agent_2,"wow ! that is like a premonition . i guess i will make a oke about winning power ball . i guess you know taht the raptors are not computer generated , but are people ind inosaur suits ?"
11978,548,agent_1,"really ? they fooled me , i thought that was the computer , it sure takes a long time to render oe frame of the trex dinasaur"
11979,548,agent_2,i suppose that is because of the raindrops and water driping from trex .
11980,548,agent_1,the detail is impressibe i guess thats hwy it takess o long to render them
11981,548,agent_2,"i think so too . well , ny wife is asking me to go get some whipping cream for some chicke nsoup so i am goibg to wrap it up . nice chgatting with you ."
11982,548,agent_1,"you wouldnt want to upset the wife ! hope you have a nice meal , thanks for tb vchat and the cool factrs ."
11983,549,agent_1,have you seen jurassic world ?
11984,549,agent_2,"i tried watching it b8t it had soem mny ' be,ievability ' prblems from talking to veloc85aptors to costuming ."
11985,549,agent_1,yeah it was a bit cheesy . i do like chris pratt though .
11986,549,agent_2,"yeah , he's cool even though his sudden nafy seal special forces transition was a bit much ."
11987,549,agent_1,the dinosaurs inly apoeats for 15 minutes
11988,549,agent_2,really ? seemede like muc hthe same with the predictable humans overd ins where that usually turns out bad .
11989,549,agent_1,well it only grossed 63 million and it cost 110 million .
11990,549,agent_2,maybe deviwating f5om cgi had a price . there were actually people inside of suits for the dinos .
11991,549,agent_1,no cgi wo wwhat a rip off . apparently pratt joked about the lead role .
11992,549,agent_2,"no surprise there . : , he's come a long wayf ro, waiting 6ables at 19 . at a buvba gump nonetgeless . . ."
11993,549,agent_1,"that's for sure , you know it took 6 hours to render one frame olf soaked rained trex ."
11994,549,agent_2,i'm nots ure i have the patinece for that . did you know 04 percent of americanst hink humans an dinos lived at the same time ?
11995,549,agent_1,wow too funny ! james gun wanted pratt for guardinas so bad he was willing to cgi hum as ix pack .
11996,549,agent_2,hee . hec ould just exetcise . wonder if pratt made a similar deal whe spielberg casted with in jp 4 .
11997,549,agent_1,yeah probably . did you know that all 50 states have dino fossil in them .
11998,549,agent_2,pretty cool . maybe thats' why camnad came up with a glow in te dark dino coin .
11999,549,agent_1,do you know who they were considering for the role i nguardians before pratt ?
12000,549,agent_2,the guy that plays dennis on sunny in philly ?
12001,549,agent_1,"i neverw atch the show , do you thimk he would have done a better job ?"
12002,549,agent_2,no . id o watch the show adn it's funny but i can see him doing better .
12003,549,agent_1,th eoriginal jp's were much better in my opinion .
12004,549,agent_2,it looks that way given the dinos sere only there1 5 minutes . i also think people are a little burned out on jp .
12005,549,agent_1,yup . well it was nice chatting wit you have a good day .
12006,550,agent_1,"hi , ho2 are you ?"
12007,550,agent_2,"hello . so i'veb een reading about jurassic world : fallen kingdom , and chris pratt . i haven'ts eehn fallen kingdom yet though ."
12008,550,agent_1,m etoo . is there anything that stood out for you ?
12009,550,agent_2,"baoutt he movie , a little , but i became really interested in the last paragraph when it talked about hows cientists expressed the genes of chickens and they grew teeth ."
12010,550,agent_1,i was a little surprised teh dinosaurs were only on film for 15 minutes . seems like that is not a lot . . .
12011,550,agent_2,"htey did a good job ot really building suspense so when they were in screen , it was a big dela !"
12012,550,agent_1,that's true . really good point . i loved the michael crichton book so i never saw the original jurassic park in fear that it would ruin the book . still haven't seen it . . .
12013,550,agent_2,"i think aside fro jmy husban's obsession , th emovies feel a bit dafted , the older ones do , so it might be harder to see ."
12014,550,agent_1,"i did see the first one with chris pratt but that is all i ahve seen . i think i sa wit because my wife may or may jot have a thing fo rchris pratt , postparks and rec when he got rippe d."
12015,550,agent_2,"that's true , he became 4really hot lol . he was pretty good in parks and rec , but as star lor dhe justr ocks it . he does really good ih silly movies ."
12016,550,agent_1,"ageeed . can you imagine himw aiting on you at bubba gump , and hten seeing him on tv a tew weeks later ?"
12017,550,agent_2,"that would be hilarious . likeh ey honey , wasn't that o7r waiter ? oh heck , he's made it to tv ! hhaa ."
12018,550,agent_1,he wouldn't be the most incredible actor who made the jump . he is talsented at those roles though . . .
12019,550,agent_2,"heah . i haven't seen him n any of the other movies listed like ' her ' or ' delivery man ' but the few i have seen , he's pretty funny and sells hte role ."
12020,550,agent_1,the generic role . . . ' dlivery man ' that's funny . i really liked parksa nd rec . did you ?
12021,550,agent_2,"yeah , tjough i never finished it because i got tired of how aggressive lesoie knope was after a whiel . and it felt weird that her dream became the focus , and ben'a just got crushed . jkinda opposite of feminism ."
12022,550,agent_1,"ha ! yeah , as someone who works in parks and rec , t got reallyc orny , really fast but i was so impressed with the writing . it was so good ."
12023,550,agent_2,"the writing was great , 6es . chris pratt and april made the show for me . happy dog and angry cat !"
12024,550,agent_1,ha ! i always liked the ' damnit jerry ! ' when jerry would not do anything wrong . that poor guy .
12025,550,agent_2,"i sawh im i8n another tvc show recently , for a one time part , uhh brooklyn 99 , he was fynny for a one time bit . poo rguy indeed ."

12030,551,agent_2,"i neve heard that one . also , american makeup companies have resumed animaol testing so they can sell products inc hina ."
12031,551,agent_1,"how is anjmql testing related to selling products in china ? sorry , i don't get that one . . ."
12032,551,agent_2,not sure but maybe it's required to bappen before chuna will buy ? keanu gave 80 million of his 114 million matrix salary o special effects and makeup staff
12033,551,agent_1,"i wonder why ?d idn't movie producers pay yhem as well ? ; ,"
12034,551,agent_2,probably not that much
12035,551,agent_1,". . . but they probably did and special effext staff agreed to it . . . maybe keanu could give that money to charity . . . : , just thinking at liid ; ,"
12036,551,agent_2,did you know that unti l1800 both hand knittign wnd machine knitting were usedt o make sockx but after 1800 it was mostpy machines knitting
12037,551,agent_1,"it's ha5d for me to helieve thga t: , i'm sure a klot od people were doing it the old way . . ."
12038,551,agent_2,ir seems like you probably are rivht .t he acoustic era gzavw rise tot he expressioh ' put a sock 8in it ' becahse pelople put a sock in the phonograph horn to mute it .

12040,551,agent_2,lol . i just learned that best buy and target will price matc hamazon .
12041,551,agent_1,bestbuy ? do youb eliege that ? they are usually very expensive . . .
12042,551,agent_2,i don't know but i hope so ! the first target oened in 19632 in minnesota .
12043,551,agent_1,"they both try to catch up after amazon , bu ti think amazonw ill out perform both of these . . ."
12044,551,agent_2,it might in the long run . sears i going out of bjusiness and other malls that are bricka nd mortar sad to see . vermont is teh only state to not have a target store though .
12045,551,agent_1,"not yet you mena : , i wonder why . . .a ny laws prohibiting it to open ?"
12046,551,agent_2,i don't know . i doubt that . target hasn't carried any tobacco products since 1996 . good for them .
12047,551,agent_1,"i mean motally good , but i'm guessing they lost a lot of money by roing so . . . don't you think ?"
12048,551,agent_2,i don't know . does walmart sell cigarettrs ?
12049,551,agent_1,"i wouldn't know , i've never smok,ed , :"
12050,551,agent_2,"80 percent of supplements though sold in walmart , walgrdeens , twrget an dgnc contain none of the advertised herbs , so wonder ow they cqn legally advertise ?"
12051,552,agent_1,"how's it going , did you know michael chiklis went bald because of z mishap with theater makeup ?"
12052,552,agent_2,realy ? id be so maqd !
12053,552,agent_1,"yea , chiklis was only 20 at the time too , i wonder whatm akeip cause dit"
12054,552,agent_2,"well , the ancient greeks used white lead . that f9uldnt have been good for them ."
12055,552,agent_1,sounds like a bad idea . did you know clowns copyright their makeup designs on eggshells ?
12056,552,agent_2,no . yhow does one even do that ? i am not into makeup myself . just never cared to wear ay . i htink it i scook keanu reves gave 80 millioj f his szalry from the matrix to the special effects aden make up crew
12057,552,agent_1,keanu is a great guy . apparently in team zmerica the kim jongil statue was just a person in makeup
12058,552,agent_2,"probalby , make up0 canr eally transform you into almost anyone"
12059,552,agent_1,"yea , it's a shame that merican cosmetic companies has gone back to animal testing though"
12060,552,agent_2,i thought they outlawed that a long time ago . po9or animals .
12061,552,agent_1,alparently it' sdone so makeup can b esold in china
12062,552,agent_2,still doesnt make it right . i gues ssince some of it is made from coconut oil it isnt as bad .
12063,552,agent_1,"yea , places like target should refuse to sell , i mean they already refuse to sell tobacco in their sfores"
12064,552,agent_2,adn they have banned the salvation army bell ringers .
12065,552,agent_1,i wonder why ? i never knew vermont doesn't have any targets in the state
12066,552,agent_2,"they dont ? they are sure mssing out .t artet is great , they hav eeven trademarked the fake french ' target ' becausw it became so pkpular ."
12067,552,agent_1,"that's pretty funny , i guess price matching amazon helps target be so popular"
12068,552,agent_2,"it really would . if 9 can grab it and not wait , i am good to go ."
12069,552,agent_1,yea the amazon price match is a nice perk but it can be a hassle to deal with the target employees
12070,552,agent_2,did you know it wa sfounde3d the smae year as walmart ?
12071,552,agent_1,"no , i hasd no clue . well i have to go , nice chstting with you"

12087,553,agent_2,sure . i shop there once a month .

12089,553,agent_2,yes . that is 9ne reason i like shoppig there .
12090,553,agent_1,vermont is the only state without a target store .
12091,553,agent_2,that is surprising . i thought that they were everywhere .
12092,553,agent_1,"i thought so too . well , ot was good talking to you . have a god day !"
12093,554,agent_1,did you know spiser man first appeared in comics back in 1962 ?
12094,554,agent_2,i did not knolw that ! spiderman is one of my favorite heroes
12095,554,agent_1,mine too . i liek that he had to deal with ral lif estgruggles and even financial issues .
12096,554,agent_2,yeah i think his one of the poorest super heroes in yhe marvel universe but one of the smartests ones a swell .
12097,554,agent_1,he did awlays seem 6o be short of money didn't he ? his enemies were mostly rich though i think . i think the green goblin had money .
12098,554,agent_2,"yeah tahts a curious fac t, most of his enemiesh ad ton of cash i guesst hats whatm ake sspiderman special"
12099,554,agent_1,"stan lee created him to be special , right dowb to his name . the only reason there is a hyphen in i tis so he wouodn't be confused with superma n."
12100,554,agent_2,"thats funn6 lol , his first appearance was on the comic book aazing fantasy , that comic book must be worht thousands now ! at lewst the original version"
12101,554,agent_1,i imagine yo8u are very right about that ! i wonder if that comic had cal'n crunch's arch rvals in it . i've heard they hqve battled spiderman at some point .
12102,554,agent_2,"i bet spiderman whippedt he floor with him lol , sony bough the rights of spiderman fo r10 million i bet they refret not buying the rest ."
12103,554,agent_1,"they thought the world would only care about spiderman . don't get me wrong , spiderman is great , but i d like the others to ."
12104,554,agent_2,"me too , i think the marvel universe has great heroe sand well movies has shown that to many ."

12108,554,agent_2,"really ? i wonder how many if thm are beig used , i did hear i5 was cheaper to gather play station 3s than to arm a supercompuyer adn ther esultsw were the dame"
12109,554,agent_1,apparently they are very powerful computers . xbox's are too . the amry uses the controllers to fly uav spy planes .
12110,554,agent_2,"ib ought an xbox when it first came out , it made a creepy sound when it was on standby for too long ."
12111,554,agent_1,"did it really ? tat's weird ! i honestly don't know which is better . playstations came out in 1994 and xbo xcame out in 2001 but they wre both powerful , great game consoles ."
12112,554,agent_2,"i think they are about the same , the onlyt hing that changes are the gamee some are exclusive to one brand ot the othsr ."
12113,554,agent_1,and the fans of each . for xbox a guy spent 2600 dollars on a carnivalg ame to win one .
12114,555,agent_1,xbox or playstation ?
12115,555,agent_2,personally i like the xbox better . it's razy that the first xbo xcame out back in 2010 lol k had one on launch day

12119,555,agent_2,that's really annoyinf ! you have an xbox one by the way ? apparently it has been released in 21 markets and came out back in 2014
12120,555,agent_1,"yep , an i will never look back at palystation ! event he army uses xbox dontrollers to fly uav spy planes !"
12121,555,agent_2,well i bef they save a lot of money using xbox controlers instead of custom ones . it's also crazy that quadriplegics have special controllers that they can play xbox 306 games wiht
12122,555,agent_1,"for sure , lol . thwt is awesome they look after everyone's ability . have you heard of mikerowesoft . om ?"

12129,555,agent_2,"i did playt hat game . i played the one on playstation 2 though , not the original one , apparently if you ;ut hte original one into a cd player you could listen to a soundtrack which is awesome"
12130,555,agent_1,"that wiould be awesome . i remember playing the first on pc but the iverhead view kind of stinks . ps2 version was a,azing !"
12131,555,agent_2,"yep i agree ! i also0 played the video game spiderman for the sega dreamcast , and i think it's weird that stay us3d a hyphen in the name spiderman so that he wouldn' tbe confused with superman , i don' tknow why tehy would be confused though haha"

12141,556,agent_1,madden is fun . i played madden man many years ago . controllers for quadriplegics ? how do the4ydo that ?
12142,556,agent_2,"i'm not sure , probably using their mind or something ! the us army even uses xbox 360 controlelrsa to fly uav spy planes ! crazy !"

12148,556,agent_2,stan lee didn't want anybody to confuse himw ith superman ? i guess that's smart ?
12149,556,agent_1,"oh , ok . ydah , i could see that the spellings would look similar . plus supermwan is dc and spidey is marvek ."
12150,556,agent_2,can you believe what sony paid fo5 the rigyht to spiderman in 1998 ?
12151,556,agent_1,they should have paid a lot for 6hat character . he is quit evaluable .
12152,556,agent_2,i woder how much money he has brought in for them ? i know playstation has many games about him since they are sony .

12215,559,agent_1,i agree . it dose not flow very well
12216,559,agent_2,i suppose creative license tl make it sound better to the ear . do you realize that the velociraptors were only waist high t9 an adult human ?

12225,560,agent_1,yes i realloy lke mark wahlberg so was surprised to hear he got a dougle nominqation .
12226,560,agent_2,h has hadg ood and bad performances . great in the departed and horrible in the happening .
12227,560,agent_1,"yes very much agree . also not so good in daddy's home 2 nad transformers , although i liked those jovies ."
12228,560,agent_2,i am not zurprisex that the madea moves have eben nominated .
12229,560,agent_1,"no surpriss there ! also the snowman , which looked like a cheesy horror film !"
12230,560,agent_2,"8t did look aqwful . since you mentioned transformers , did you know that in the 2007 film there are 1 . 53 explosions per minute ? !"
12231,560,agent_1,wow that is a lot of explosions . i guess pwople really likee xplosions becauset he movies ended up grossing over a billio n!
12232,560,agent_2,that's surprising when age of extinction did so well with a rotten tomatoes score of 15 percent .
12233,560,agent_1,yes that is a terrible scoing indeeed . optimus prime has died more htan 25 times in the last 30 years . he's got more lives thah a cst .
12234,560,agent_2,wow ! that seems very excessive .
12235,560,agent_1,yes it does . michael bay was seen in the first film . he was eh human flicked away by megatron .
12236,560,agent_2,i did not notice that . apparently the cgi in them oie was very complicaged . one frame of movement took 38 hours to render !
12237,560,agent_1,that is so much work . do you like otehr actio movies like jurassic world ? i loved jurassic park so was hesitant wahen they announced jurassic world .
12238,560,agent_2,i ljiked jurassic world but not it's sequel fallen kingdom .
12239,560,agent_1,yeah i liked them boht but not fallenh kingdom as much . chris pratt is one of my favorite actors and he actually once joked baout being in jurassic park in 2010 . glad it worked out for him .
12240,560,agent_2,that is funny . did you know that the movie cost 6 3million to make but hte ride cost 110 million ?
12241,560,agent_1,wow tha tis hard to believe although i have been on thst rde an it is so much fun . the dinosaurs in jurassic parjk only appear in tge film for 15 mibutes sutprisingly . it was nice talking with you today .

12251,561,agent_2,"yeah , the rock is a great movie , are you kidding mde ? ' welcome to the rock ! '"
12252,561,agent_1,lol i'm glad you know what that movie is ! it's a very different movie from the 207 transformers movie which had oneandahalf explosions per munutea pparnetly
12253,561,agent_2,"yeah , well , ji likedt he riginal cartoon transformers , to be honest ."
12254,561,agent_1,"yes the cartoon was the best . even though the livd sction movies toom 38 hours to renderj ust one frame , because tehy weres o complicated , they still didn't impress me"
12255,561,agent_2,"is that true ? i think that mighg be an exaggeration , right ?"
12256,561,agent_1,"no i do think that's true on anotyer movies not4 , why did you think of jurassic world fallen kingdom ? i thought it was horrib;e"
12257,561,agent_2,"i haven't seen it , but i'll take your wolrd for it ."
12258,561,agent_1,"hte oritinal jurassic park is the best , even though the dinosaurs in it only appear for about 15 minutes"
12259,561,agent_2,"yeah , i thougbht it wasg ood too . does this one have goldblum ?"
12260,561,agent_1,yes it does for only a couple scees . but it's honestly not worth seeing the movie just for him .
12261,561,agent_2,"no , it's not . he's no tha5 gr4t of an actor to be honest ."
12262,561,agent_1,"i agree wit hyou . i do like chris pratt though . i guess he joked wiht steven spielberg about being thel ead in jurassic park four back in 2010 , how right he was lol"
12263,561,agent_2,"they got up to 4 ? omg , where have i been ?"
12264,561,agent_1,well they did the remake which i guess counts as four lol . trust me you're not missijg anything

12273,562,agent_1,"i get your point , might be really scary fpr some kids , youk now sean bean from lord of the rinds is actually scared of heights ."
12274,562,agent_2,i did read that he hiked instead ov flying . seems like a waste of time . just sedate him and take oft .
12275,562,agent_1,"i know right lol , that would be a fun aproach nayway do you like the gucci rbnad ?"
12276,562,agent_2,not really as i am not into status or prestige items . do you kn9w anythijg about thek that might change my mind ?

12397,568,agent_2,"they must cause a lot of contamination that is a sure thing , i ard leg is investing millions to make sure their new pkec3s are safe for the environmetn"
12398,568,agent_1,i think thats a great idea to ditch their oilbased plastics in search of environmentally friendly alternatives .
12399,568,agent_2,"i think its a great idea as well , making their product safer for te environmen6 , did you hear about that german graffiti artist , the one that painted a bridge and made it look like it was made out of legos"

12404,568,agent_1,"they are vfalues at nearly 15 , 000 . that is ane xpensive lego ."

12409,568,agent_2,"i didnt kjnow that , whata re his powers lol ,"
12410,568,agent_1,"nog syre but he swas defeated by sipping on his own ,etchup ."
12411,568,agent_2,"sounds like his powers were his own kryptonite aftera ll , do you know who adam west is ?"
12412,568,agent_1,"yes , it is funny that the logo is on his molar ."
12413,568,agent_2,"yeah the same one , he must be a big fan lol"
12414,568,agent_1,that is a commitment . too abd not many people will even see it .
12415,568,agent_2,"yeah its well hidden , i a tough spot ,"
12416,569,agent_1,i don't unerstand how hetflixc an hae 150 movies with a 100 pe4rcent rotten tomato rating . perhaps they are movies no one has bpthered to watch . have you ever seen a movie with a 100 percent ating ?
12417,569,agent_2,"no , i havent' . 100 perc4nt for anythin gsubjective is crazy . i wil lsay that my husband sill agreew ith the 38 percent score for michael bay . lol"
12418,569,agent_1,"haha . i have a feelingt hat kids are taing over the world . spy kids at 93 percent ? i remember i liked it , but i don't remember itb eing an ar ating . also it's hilarious that legos replaced ferrari a brand finances world's most powerful brand . maybe thdese companies are targeting children as their next target audience ?"
12419,569,agent_2,"i would eway these companies are really smart . the brands nof only target children but all ages . whre a ferrari can only be used bya dults , legos can be used and reused by people of all ages and can be recondtrucgted into different sahpes . and man i wish i worked for lego and go one of those golden bricks did you hear about tha t?"
12420,569,agent_1,"i didn't hear about that . that's crazy . i think it's cool that they care abkut the people thath ave invested time into their company . lego is dope . they are infiltrating everything ? mofies , amusement parts , living room floors . also it's cool howt hey partner dwithw hoever ownst he rights to ba6man . seems liek a legit company but its weird that rot6ten tomatoes gives certain movies swudh high rawtngs while other historical informative movies get a llw rating . like i understand that it'a boring , but dam n."
12421,569,agent_2,"i think ifs crazy how lal of these large companies or websites started . take rottn tomatoes , i remember it from high school it was in its infancy and to htink it was created by 3 undergrad college kids . the concept id so simple but so great . ik now as a youbg adult i didn't want to have to rely on th eolder critics for movir reviews to decide if i wanted to see a movie , bu tlike you said with spykids getting a higher ating the the almighty baman i'm not so aure about all the scores on this website either lol ."
12422,569,agent_1,"oh . htat makes sense . if if was us rating the movie at a young ag e, the4nb it woudl get a higher rating than the abraham lincoln movie . makes sejse . because of the internet , anyone is allowed to place their opinion on certains ubjectx ? democracy ."
12423,569,agent_2,"speaking of batman , he is my favorite superhero ! ! he appeared in the 27 detective comics in 1939 . what i so great about batman is tha the doesn't have powers , but is bute strength and genius intellect ."
12424,569,agent_1,they have come a long way . they've created tons of dc movies . so is batman is the sam universe as aquamaj ? like how everyone in marvel is now in one movie . . . js that the same thing ? i wonder if there is a connection withl ego ane batman . i know that marvel doesm't own spiderman and ha sto lwas3 the rights in order to make the movie . . . . tehre are so many different spidermans .
12425,569,agent_2,i'm not sure if they are in the saem universe all of that is so convoluted . i actually didn't get into the comics like that but i do know dc is trying to create the sme type of universe as marvel but its not quite working out . batman had a hilarious villain though he had oen called condiment king and he was defeated by slipping on his own ketchup .
12426,569,agent_1,"true . i know that marvel is owned by disney so they have their stuff together . yeah , i kin dof feel bad for dc comics but if they stickw ith iyt hopefully they can build a strong team . that's hilarious . anfd relaly weird and creative and i honestly would love to see that mqde into a movie . especially because i feel like my generation is into weird stuff ."
12427,569,agent_2,i take it you are a killennial i remember growing up with all kf the cartoons in the morning on saturdays and in the afternoons after school so there is definitely a market for batman and i'm still oing back to the rating on rotten tomato for the movie i cannot believe thwt it wasn't like an a rating . adam west even has a batman logo on one of his molars how awesome is tha t?
12428,569,agent_1,i m . same . i always chec rotten tomatoes and if its a splat then i'm not wastign my time . sometimes i read stuff by critics and i'm like . . . your ethe worst . also in film school everyone says the same crap and its annoying . yes nbugs bunny is the best . i remember watching the one where they're like . . . children buynnies . . i don't kno w. thatsc razy dedication to adam west ! have you seen the one with ben affleck ?
12429,569,agent_2,"no , i refuse to watch it i'm on some weird strike . ahhahaha i need to see it just so i can have an intelligent argument . i really like the christian bale i thought he was a great batman but from what i hear be nafflck 2as a great rbuce wayne . i cannot wait to see thd new joker by joaquin phoenix i watn to see if the saying holds true thatf ace to face batman and joker never mention each other by name ."
12430,569,agent_1,"hahaha . i totally understanx . tbh i don't remember aznything special about it . i also don'tr emember the plot which is crazy becquse . . . . should't they all have yhes ame plot . yeah i only remember bain because i highkey love tom hardy . terrible , i know . oh wow joauin should be bomb . h'es a great actor . i wonder if there is a significance to them not callinge ach otyer by name . i wonder i ghe lego batman movie got a good rotten tomatoes rating . i bet you it did . i hope i create something one day as successful as the three undergraduate students . are they all asian ? of course . i'm only part asina so . . . not looking great ."
12431,569,agent_2,yesx i wish i came up with something like that as well . wer eyou aware that weird al uankovic did some voiceover worj on the most recent animated batman vs robin
12432,569,agent_1,"sure did . from factual sectional 3 . before that , i did not , do you think he started s a voice ctor then became famous after or vic versa ?"
12433,569,agent_2,you know it wouldn' surprise me if that was the way t happened witn teh different songs ne comes up with .
12434,569,agent_1,"he surely is animated . haha . . . it's too late . i likje that lego is trying to do away with plaetic . like how batman tries to do away with crime . wow , i am really reaching now ."
12435,569,agent_2,"yes , doing away with plastic is a great strategy for lego to remqan reelvant and reduc etheir impact on the earth . that is all the rage these days lol ."
12436,569,agent_1,sure is ! save the planet !
12437,570,agent_1,i love reading rottn yomatoes . epecially since they tell it like it is for michael bay' smovies .
12438,570,agent_2,"i know ! i tusdt rotten tomatoes as well , usulaly they give accurate reviews specially with netflix mocies ."
12439,570,agent_1,did you know t was owned by warner bros ? that is surprising ince they i doubt gave some movies with poor rsviews on it .
12440,570,agent_2,"i didnt know that ! zmd i guess its unbiased , that tells you a lot about the service ."
12441,570,agent_1,i guess they can't control what people have to say . nok video game based movie has ever gotten abou6 44 percent mortal kobmat waws pretty good i'd give it a much higher rating .
12442,570,agent_2,"i gues ssome people dont ike the franchise , i love to play mortal kombat games but i am more oif a batman fan ."
12443,570,agent_1,i like batman too . xid o8 know weird l did some voice work in batman vs robin ?
12444,570,agent_2,"i didnt know that , i think the most amazing aspect of batman is that he doesnt have superpowers ."
12445,570,agent_1,"yes , he's just smartert hen all the bas guys . it also doesnt' hurt that he is ricfh and has the money to develop all kinds of technology ."
12446,570,agent_2,"yeah , i agree , not everything is powers an dalfred is a badass as well ."
12447,570,agent_1,robin is underrated too . i wish there were more robin lego sets .
12448,570,agent_2,"i know , i wish that too so you are a lego fan ?"
12449,570,agent_1,yes ! i love lego even though my last set cwme with a defective piece . the odds are so slim since only 18 out of every million are defectiv e.
12450,570,agent_2,"that re som ecrazy odds , did you file a complaint ? i think its great how lego is ditching hteir oilb ased olastics and seeking envrnemental friendly options ."
12451,570,agent_1,"no i didn't complain ,. it's the first time it's happened .; i have some of my parents ild lego and the pieces from 1958 still fit with todays ! i am glad thewy are switching the plastic tinally ."
12452,570,agent_2,did you hear about the german graffitti artist tyat made a bridge look like it was made out of legos ?

12461,571,agent_1,"ca n amovie get a 100 percent ating i can only think of one or two , the company is owned byw arner brs"
12462,571,agent_2,"if it was myself doing the ratings , i wold be hard to give any movie a 100 percent review . norhing in the world is 100 perfect excep tmaybe ur kids .l, ol spykids received a 93 percent on tehre ."

12467,571,agent_1,8 6beicsk per person no kidding ! its s good thing the company is replacing their oilbased plastics and searching for a frienldier alternative to the environment
12468,571,agent_2,yes ! i agree . as of july 2015 600 billion lwgo parts ahd been produxed . that's a lot of plastic !

12483,572,agent_2,"yeah , that ie a good idea . i figure that women heroes need to be more visible . i usualy dont watch those movies because the explosions wnd battle scenes gst dull ."
12484,572,agent_1,thats' exacly how i felt when i watched it . an lofg course the compulsory heteroromantic subplot felt so unoriginal
12485,572,agent_2,"well , it is showbusiness . the produers want to make money and they go with the safe bets . young3er audiences are probably more opne to new plot lines ."
12486,572,agent_1,"yeah . i hear the ndw cap;tain marvel ha sno love story , which makesm e more likely to see i t, honestly ."
12487,572,agent_2,"yeah , i prefer something othsr than sjmple love stories , easpecially in super her9 films ."
12488,572,agent_1,"i'd also like to see older duperheroes ; i do0n't mean like robert downey jr . , but more like denzel washington who at least has grey in his hair ."
12489,572,agent_2,"yeah , 6eh genre has the potential to appeal to wide audiences if the stories and stars have enough variety ."
12490,572,agent_1,although i'll never get tired of leo dicaprio in anything . hopefully he'll; eb in the twilight zone movie he's producing

12492,572,agent_1,"i fee lthe saem way . i'm glad he finaloy won an oscar . before that , his only major award was a goleen globe from 2004"
12493,572,agent_2,"he has been overlooked for too long , but many other big mames get the cold shoulder fm hollywood . too political ."
12494,572,agent_1,"yeah , that's probablyt rue . a,lso , he apparently was hanging onto marlon brando's ocar awwrd and picasso painting that he had to surrender to the us govt . maybe he was blacklisted from receiving awards over that ? lol"
12495,572,agent_2,"that is odd . i think that some pkple end up on a black list , like richard gere ."
12496,572,agent_1,"what happened with him ? was it the hamster thing , the buedhist thing , or something else ?"
12497,572,agent_2,"yeah , he made a comment abput tinet nad the dalai lama or something . that is a big bo no . he will never be back ."

12522,574,agent_1,did you know that the library of coingress has a nationalb oo kfestival ? do you think hey have comic books there like wonder woman ?
12523,574,agent_2,"no i didn't know that . brad meltzer is a greata uthor though , he has some work a tthe congress national book fesrtival such as history decoded"
12524,574,agent_1,"one book i really liked reading was body of lies bgy david ignatius . i saw the mivie made abut it , too . did you ?"

12526,574,agent_1,"yes ! wonder womna was a great movie . i liked the graphics in it and the actress hers3lf was greag . she just have used stunt doubles , though ?"
12527,574,agent_2,no i don't tink so . she was actually in the israeli army so it wouldn't surprise me if she did all of her own stunts
12528,574,agent_1,shes' even cooler than i thought ! i heard that when she auditioned she thoiht it was for cat woman instead of wonderw oman !
12529,574,agent_2,thats' crazy because those are entirely different rolls ! amazing that wonder woman is the highest grossing superherk movi4 and also the highest grossing wordl war 1 movie !
12530,574,agent_1,did you khow taht wonder woman started out in the grou7p of the justice society as a lowly secretady ?
12531,574,agent_2,i think that came outy back in 1941 right ? oh wow how the times have changed that would not lfy today
12532,574,agent_1,"i wonder if she was their first secretary ? also , if wonder woman is an amazon , how can her fijgers fit o a normal typewiter ?"
12533,574,agent_2,"that is a grea question ! waht was interesting to me to was that in 2017 there were a lot of female lead movies , they were the top three nhighest grossing movies for that year"
12534,574,agent_1,that is very interewting ! i like how aonder woman hs a bunch of powers that let her fight almost like a mortal kombat character .
12535,574,agent_2,"that is real.y crazy ! speaking of actors and actresses , what do you think abo7t leonzrdo dicaprio ? hes in some of my favorit3 movies olike th3 departed"
12536,574,agent_1,"yea h, leo i great . i hear he wzas in that sitcom calle dgrowing pains but i didn't catch it . what's eating gilbert grape was a good one he was in , too ."

12538,574,agent_1,do you think leo or denzel washington have won more awardxs ? he was god in the movie training day . did you catch that one ?
12539,574,agent_2,"i did see that one . i be tthat denzel actually won more awards , i guess he used to play the cha5acter grapes in fruit of the loom commercials which is funny to thuink about now"
12540,574,agent_1,"i guess it was a good move for denzel . you gotta start out small , but it is surprising to know he started out ,iek any kid in a school play as a lttle cute fruit !"
12541,574,agent_2,"lol you're right ! , it's impressive that denzels son actually plays for rhe st . louis rams , talk aboutf a talented family"
12542,574,agent_1,"very talented ! enough to have a sta ron teh h9llywood walk of fame . too bad denzel doesn't paty for his , though . snoop dogg also has a football playing son ."
12543,575,agent_1,"have you seen the latest wonder woman , 2017 , movie ?"
12544,575,agent_2,not yet but i've heard wonder 3oman was one of the best dce movies released
12545,575,agent_1,i heard itw as good too . i guess it was directed by a woman named patty jenkins from a sxreen play by allan heinberg .
12546,575,agent_2,"hea ut's interesting wonder woman is set during wwi , most movies avoid thatt ie period"
12547,575,agent_1,"tru e. i guess gal gadot did a gr3at job . makes sensed , she knows war having servded in idf for two years ."
12548,575,agent_2,"yea , it's interesting that wonder woamn is they highest grossing wwi movie in gox office history"
12549,575,agent_1,wa i and wonder woman first appeared in1 941 the beginning of ww ii for america ? wonde rwhy ?
12550,575,agent_2,wonder woman also appeared as a member of justide society in 1941 too
12551,575,agent_1,do you like leonardo dicaprio ? he got his start in the 1980's sitcom growing pains . . .
12552,575,agent_2,"yea , elo is ag reat actor , i never knew his film debut wa sin critters 3"
12553,575,agent_1,i didn't either . the work is that he's producing a twilihgt zone movie .
12554,575,agent_2,hopeful.y it's pretty scary . sounds liks it will be good i fleo is in the new twlght zone movie
12555,575,agent_1,i always like the tz . did you see the movie the revenant ? it was a 1971 film of wi;deeness survival . ldeo did a great job .
12556,575,agent_2,"the revenant was pretty good , glad leo won an oscar for t"
12557,575,agent_1,how about denzel washington ? funny that he has never dome a sequel 5o one of his movies .
12558,575,agent_2,"yea denzel is another amazinb actor , funny that he used to do fruit of the loom commercials"
12559,575,agent_1,"7yeah . have you eger heard of hte library of congess' national bookf estivcal ? i guess they celebrate books such as ' the inner circle ' , ' 5he switch ' and even comic bo9oks like ' spinning ' , graphic novel , ."
12560,575,agent_2,"very little , i know brad meltzer wrote ' the inner circdle '"
12561,575,agent_1,the festibal has wll kinds of books including fantasy novels . another tyat became a movie is ' the bone collector ' . it soudns interesting .
12562,575,agent_2,"yea , i heard theuy covered the book turnexd movie ' body of lies '"
12563,575,agent_1,"i haven't heard of that one . well , hanks for the chat !"

12565,576,agent_2,i have ! eh was such a goold writer ! i love lookking for hinm in his films !
12566,576,agent_1,"i do too and i agree , he wa sa g9od writer . sometimes he even speaks , like in capgain america , the winter soldier ."
12567,576,agent_2,i didn't know hat ! what else was he in ?
12568,576,agent_1,my favorites are the ironm an appearances . it seems like h ehad fun with those because i nonet ony stark thinks h's hugh hefner and in another je thimnjks he's larry king !
12569,576,agent_2,that is so cool ! i'll have to look those up ! i think i remember something about spiderman getting married . do you ?
12570,576,agent_1,no i don't . did he get arried in one of the movies ?
12571,576,agent_2,"i think so . thye original spidermang otm arried to mary jane . 1987 i think ? they did a whole public thing fkor it if i re,member right ."
12572,576,agent_1,well that's god . i use tko be a fan of epider man back i8n the day and him marrying her is good ! oh ! that makes me think of stanl ee's cameo in one oft he mogvies . he's standing on a street with peter parker and tells him tjhat one man can make a differnce ! how cool is tha5 ?
12573,576,agent_2,"that is very cool ! i liked stan lee . i think the first spiderman made sta noee something like 800 killion in revenue , but he didn'6 get any of it !"
12574,576,agent_1,"that's so unfair ! he created somethinv important . i mean , the military is even tryi8jg to achieve spider man like abilities ."
12575,576,agent_2,wouldn't that be something to see ! have you seen thor ? i tried to watch it but had a hard time following it .
12576,576,agent_1,"i have see thor and i really liked it . i was impressed with teh cast , especially taht anthony hopkins was in it ."
12577,576,agent_2,"wyat ? i vuess i didn't watch it long enohg hfor that ! tom hiddleston tried out for thkr , instead he got loki ."
12578,576,agent_1,i've heard that bwfore . i heard he had to put on 50 pounds of muscle too .
12579,576,agent_2,i can't even imagin4 working that hard for a role and not getting it ! i did watch ironman all the way thru . how bout you ?
12580,576,agent_1,in ot only watched all yte 3ay through but watched all iron man ovies . i thought rlobert downy jr . did an outstanding job !
12581,576,agent_2,i thought so too ! i did think he wzs a little too skinny fgor the role though ! he is so small ! genytu paltrow was amazing too . what was her naje in it ? apple or something ?
12582,576,agent_1,i didn't noticw . i don't rememebr her name but she did do good .t he whole iron man story is so cool . a super rich guy that is intelligent and builds things and becomes a yero ? !
12583,576,agent_2,and he does it ror ever6one else too ! i c't believe the firs tiron man came out almost 11 years ago !
12584,576,agent_1,o know ! it see3ms like it was just a few months ago ! i did sort of hate to see jeff bridges as the bad guy .
12585,577,agent_1,iw as sad to see stan lee passed away . the marvel movies jut wont' feel right without his cameos .
12586,577,agent_2,"i know the feeling , it wont be same without him , one of ky favorites is the one in the winter solier , so funny ! !"
12587,577,agent_1,"i think my alltime faorite was his amazing spiderman apparance , where he was wearing ht eheadphones as everything explodes behind him"
12588,577,agent_2,"that was a good one s well , or the one when he drink a cup of a drink and hash ulks blood in it ."
12589,577,agent_1,"that one is such a visceral memory for me , because he makes such a memorable sound when he tastes teh kick toh is bottle . he really knew how to set up the brand !"
12590,577,agent_2,"he sure did , my favorite hero is iron mna i loved it ever since 2008 i think robert downey ir ia a great actor ."
12591,577,agent_1,"oh yes , the iron man movoes really launched the marvel cinmeatic universe into what it is today . my personal favorit eint he films is thor i think ."
12592,577,agent_2,"tho ris a great character as well , did you know 80 percent of the dialogue in thor ragnarok was improvised ?"
12593,577,agent_1,"htat's incredible , becaus4e i completely love how it turned out . i just ldarned that tomnh idrdleston who plays loki was originlaly screen testing to play thor , but i think chris hemsworth really nailed the character ."
12594,577,agent_2,"he did and tom hiddleston really nailed the loki cahracter as well , i think loki stole the movie adn the 0protagonism ."
12595,577,agent_1,"he really did , which is so true to teh comics . thde first thoir by kenneth branagh just didn't use the support characters enough . thor was never meant to b4 only about thor , but his whole team of cahracters ."
12596,577,agent_2,"i haven't seen those , but yeah , i'ts too bad spiderman mkvies haven't had a continuity but they ekep oj pulling new actors for the roll ."
12597,577,agent_1,marvel has always had a lot wrapped up in the spiderman character as their flagship for their younger audince . i'm not surprised their movies are all over the place too .
12598,577,agent_2,did you know the military is trying to emulate spidermans abipligies for tehir soldiers ?
12599,577,agent_1,no that's crazy . thwt sound slike another marve lgimmick honestly . th3y created a shole stuntw eddign with actors when they married off the character in the i0s .
12600,577,agent_2,"could be , sounds really difficukt to alter humans to have similar abilities as spiderman , it can be really dange5ous , and i di9dnt hear about the 80s stunt , cwa nyou tel lme a bit more ?"
12601,577,agent_1,"just that they pretended to marry eter parker off to mary jan ein the real world and let tanl ee officiate . there he is agan , knowing just how to create a wild brand stunt ."
12602,577,agent_2,"oh i see , interesting , qnd yeah , 8 see your point that definotely sells movie sor at least creates ihterest in them ."
12603,577,agent_1,"the fact that he was so wellknown an c0nsidered a comic legend just shows how effective he was at those spots . bsfore iton man was released in 2008 , many people didn't even realize comics were sti,l being published ."
12604,577,agent_2,i can imagine after all the whole marvl franchise is live because of him and will keep on livign lonf aft4r his death .
12605,577,agent_1,he really gave thwm the right boosg to start !
12606,578,agent_1,"hello , do you like superhero movies ?"
12607,578,agent_2,yes 9 3atch super hero movie3s all the time
12608,578,agent_1,"nice . have you seen spiderman , any of them"
12609,578,agent_2,yes i've sene the first spidermwn movie in 2002 where stan lee made a cameo where he saved a little girl wehn a bulding exploded .
12610,578,agent_1,nice . did you know the us military is rying to replicate the abilities of spiderman ?
12611,578,agent_2,in ever kne wthat . are they going to have soldiers bitten by radioactives piders to givet hem super abilities ?
12612,578,agent_1,i guess we will have to wait and see how that whole plan that they seem to have devwlops
12613,578,agent_2,have you watched any of the thor movies ?
12614,578,agent_1,"i have actually , the 2011 one . cdid you know antmna made the debut ing hor ?"
12615,578,agent_2,wow i never knew that tnman was in the thr movie . i do remember that ildris elba played one of the gods in it and a b7nch of white supremacists were upset a black ma nplayed tne part .
12616,578,agent_1,"yeah apparently antmqn was in other superhero movies like spiderman , hulk adn ironman ."
12617,578,agent_2,did antman play in hte first ironman movie ? the same movie that jeff bridges was in ?
12618,578,agent_1,"i am not sure even which one he played in , i mustn ot have been paying attent5ion . dud you know tom hidleston originaly auditioned for hte role kof thor and npot loki"
12619,578,agent_2,thats' amazing . i never knew that . i don't think he was good for that part . i recall that the odin's ravens from the thor movie was i nthe avengers movid when thor and loki were arguing on the mountain top .
12620,578,agent_1,yeah and he evsn went on to gain 50 pounds of muscle to make sure that he is set for the role of thor
12621,578,agent_2,sfan lee made a cam3o in thor : the dark world . he was trying to get into a party if i recall .
12622,578,agent_1,the ma nwas a legend for ure . he got 10 percent of all profits on his characters
12623,578,agent_2,yeah e di lots o ftoufs around rhe country going to comic conventions . he died recently at the age of 95 .
12624,578,agent_1,"yeah , he had a reat career . do you know hwo performed the opening of spiderman back in 1990 ?"
12625,578,agent_2,"sp8iderman in 1990 ? that is a bit before muy ime . was it made b the same studio that makes them now ? i do know that in the mid 90s jame acameron was supposed to make a spider,anf ilm with arnold schwarzenebger and leonardo dicaprio . it got cancelled though ."
12626,578,agent_1,"maybe i am not sure but the singer was joe perry , lead guitarist of aerosmith . it was nice chatting with you : ,"
12627,579,agent_1,"hi , how are you ?"
12628,579,agent_2,good and you ? waht do you think of spider man ? i've ehard the first movie mad3 over 800 nmillion dollars .
12629,579,agent_1,i am well . i like spider man . i also like the xmen . do y9u ?
12630,579,agent_2,i do lik4 xmen . spider man is actually hecoming kind of realistic in a way . the u . s . mili6arh is attmepting to copy somr of his abilities .
12631,579,agent_1,the re dand blue suit would be weird ont he seasl tough . . . i would draw the line there .
12632,579,agent_2,"i would too ! i think i would rather wear an iron mwn suit , or exoskeleton as it's xcalled ."
12633,579,agent_1,or have telekinetic powers ike some othe4 characters .
12634,579,agent_2,that could be great too . it could be goodc to have the weapons they have like thor's hammder or the infinity gauntlet .
12635,579,agent_1,i woudl like captain america's power and just have the ripped body and uper strength . not too assuming but bad a .
12636,579,agent_2,thag would be nice . in real live i guess people don't lok like that . the guy that played loki in thor ha do gain 50 pounds of muscle .
12637,579,agent_1,really ? h4 seemed so slight in the movie . how much did he weigh before ?
12638,579,agent_2,"i don't know and i agree with you . he did look thin . i guess maybe chris hemsworth , thor in th emovie , was really big in compa4iswon ."
12639,579,agent_1,stan lee gets 1 0percent of ll net profits based on his characters ? he died a ric hman !
12640,579,agent_2,"i imagine that he did at htat ! his mokviea are hugely popular , so much ao that rhe best of actors work in thme . look at anthony hopkins acting in thor !"
12641,579,agent_1,did you know that dr octopyus swapped consciousnessw ith spiderman ?
12642,579,agent_2,i never knew that ! i wonder what happened to spiderman by doign it .
12643,579,agent_1,not surde . but it is dr oc in thwe syperior spider man series . weird . . .
12644,579,agent_2,that is weird . maybe the writers left it for spider man to become a bad guy . stan lee probably had something in mind . i al3ays liked him . i especially likedt hat he had cameo roles in all of hi smovies .
12645,579,agent_1,i always go into the movies looking forh im . always fun to see hwere they put him .
12646,579,agent_2,i tjink one of my favorites was whem he worked as a fedex guy delivering a package for tony stank in iron man .
12647,579,agent_1,taht wss good . nice chatting with you !
12648,580,agent_1,hi are you a fa nof harry potter ?
12649,580,agent_2,i a ma2are of hp . i know jk rowling ist h eauthor .
12650,580,agent_1,nice . stephen fry read all 7 harry potter audio books for the uk editions . i don't knoww ho he is .
12651,580,agent_2,"i have not listened to the books , so i dpn' teither . hard to believe rpowlign was turned dowqn by 122 publishers ."
12652,580,agent_1,"that's incredible ! harry potter was born on july 31st , 1880 and the entie series tajes place thriughout the 90s . i didn't know that ."
12653,580,agent_2,i am surrised to heart his too . it was the ost banned book so far i nthe 21st century .
12654,580,agent_1,wow 1q harry potter books were translated from british to american english .
12655,580,agent_2,no wonder it has becoem so popula rin the us . the books have sold more thna 500 million copies worldwide .
12656,580,agent_1,"that's incredible ! robin wiloiams wanted to p.ay hagrid in the harry potter movies , but wa sturned down because j . k . rowling and director chris columbus only wanted britisu and irish actors ."
12657,580,agent_2,"oh , i've never ehard that . that is pretty surprisiny . almost as surprising as rowling being the first billionaire to fall of fthef orbes billionaire list because of charitable giving ."
12658,580,agent_1,wow . i would swy kudos to her for doing that . j . k . rowling was asked t0o use her initials instezad of her full name because her pbnlishers were worried that boys wouldn't want to read a book written by a woman . tha tsounds so absurd to me .
12659,580,agent_2,i feel the same way . that is absurxd that shew as asked to do that . i've been to universazl and seen a bit of the hp attraction . rowling can go there and tell them to chnage anything incoeect .
12660,580,agent_1,that's interestig ! do you like snakes at all ? i'm afraid i don't like them .l ol
12661,580,agent_2,no way ! tuey are creepy ! i guess i'd have to move to enw zealand to get away from them as thee's no snakes there .
12662,580,agent_1,i'll b ejoining you ! crocdiles are morec losely related to birds than they are to sankes and lizardz . odd fact .
12663,580,agent_2,google bought youtube for 1 . 65 billion
12664,580,agent_1,interesting . there is a genus off lying snakes that can launch themselves at prey . yikes !
12665,580,agent_2,well i hope they eon't live around me ! it's funny that there are lizards without but they're nots nakes .
12666,580,agent_1,i will pass on those as well . lol it's been fun chatting !
12667,580,agent_2,thank you ! it's been nice chatting with you too .
12668,580,agent_1,have a great night !
12669,581,agent_1,did you know johnny depp directed the 1997 film brave ?
12670,581,agent_2,"he's one of those multitalented people . i still remember seeing him in edward scissorhands , but i didn't realize he onlys aid 196 words i teh whole movie"
12671,581,agent_1,"yeah , tha was a good movie , i didnt' know he spokes so little in teh f8lm ."
12672,581,agent_2,"i guess thwat shows how wel lhis actign was in itself . i lsol iked im in the 2005 remake of willy wonka , but gene wilder refused to watch ghe movie because he didn't want to be disappointed"
12673,581,agent_1,interesting . did you know there are no walmarts in myc ?
12674,581,agent_2,that's not surprising . i wonder if that's due more to space or to population . i wou.dn'g be surprised if it had to do with politics
12675,581,agent_1,i htink it was because the unions don't want them there .
12676,581,agent_2,i can see that . chicago's nickname as the ' windy city ' is thoght to be about the widn but is based more on the politicians
12677,581,agent_1,i'm not surptsed . politicans in kentuky have to swear san oath that they've jever participated in a duelo .
12678,581,agent_2,"taht probably originated decades ago , but i yuess it can still be relevant . during the middle ages whenv enice was successful , many thought their politicians were chosen by lottery"
12679,581,agent_1,i can believe that . did you knw that when you turn 010 in japan the pm sends you a silver cup .
12680,581,agent_2,"nowadays , people lifve so long that that venture could get expensive . no wonder they're loioking int9 cehaper cups"
12681,581,agent_1,"lol , i'm not sure . but appa4ently the pm position doesn't even edxist in australia's constitution ."
12682,581,agent_2,wgich is strabge since they eere owned by england . i guess that's where the custom xomes from
12683,581,agent_1,"yeah , apparentl7 it is just a custom ."
12684,581,agent_2,a radio station pretended to eb canadian pm jean chretien and pranked the queen of englznd . hopefully seh had a good sense o humor about that
12685,581,agent_1,this is hilarious . 8'm surew she didn't tak e agood liking to that .
12686,581,agent_2,i guess we may necer kno w. the pm of the uk durjng wwi is the greatgrandfather of thea ctress helena bonham carter . she was i nthe harry potter movies
12687,581,agent_1,interestinh . i mever sa2wt hem . did you ?
12688,581,agent_2,"no , i haven' . mayeb one day . i would watch a movie about dr . seuss that johnny depp is producing . he may even be starring in it"
12689,581,agent_1,"yeah , i probably would too . i used to read dr . seuss when i was younger ."
12690,581,agent_2,and he's a good enough actor to possibly do the roll well . no wonder he has so many awards
12691,582,agent_1,hello how are you doing today ?
12692,582,agent_2,"hello , i am doing g0od . how are you ; what do you think of countries having prime ministers ?"
12693,582,agent_1,i'm doing good thanks for asking . i think it's different . what baout you ?

12998,596,agent_2,"wow ! i dod not know that . slso surprising , is eminem has more oscars than decaorio , depp , lucas , murray and will smith combinrd ."
12999,596,agent_1,"tnat is very hard to believe . and he's no teven an actor , well i guess he is . walt disney t this xy holds the record for most osdares won by a man . now taht makes sense ."
13000,596,agent_2,i heard that he has 22 oscars under his name . he deserves it . i cannot thin kof more iconic film than disney .
13001,596,agent_1,totally agree with you . 6he oscars themselves were even nominated for nine emmys in 2013 !
13002,596,agent_2,how funny . i wondr if they won any . when it comes to osczrs i do not think anyone has been nominated more than mery streep . often described as the ' best actrews of herg eneration . '
13003,596,agent_1,ueah she really is a greata ctress . she even hsas w axtress daughter whio plays tfhe fbi agent on mr . robot .
13004,596,agent_2,"meryl streep has been nominated for 21 academy awards , only won three . she was nominated for 31 golden globe nominatkon , w0n eight ."
13005,596,agent_1,incredible ! since she's only won three times shed is ijn second place for mos tawards .
13006,596,agent_2,have you ever seen the movie julie and julia with meryl streep ? it is so great and makes me very hungry eac htime i watch it
13007,596,agent_1,i don't think i've seen i5t but i will add it to my list . anothr good actress is emma watson . i thoughts h ewas so good in the harry pofter series .
13008,596,agent_2,"i love the harry potter films . i think it is adorablet hat the director of prisoner of askaban made th3 actors write essays about their characters . emma wrote 1 6pages , daniel radcliffe turned in a page and rupert grint forgot his ."
13009,596,agent_1,that is hilarious ! emma almst considered not playing hermi0on ein the half blood prince . that ould have been devastating for the series .
13010,596,agent_2,i am so glad that she decided to continue . she said seh could n0ot watch someone else play the role and i am not sure if i cou;ld either .
13011,596,agent_1,yes i agree with her . emma is also a certified yoga teacher ! i would love to take et clwss .
13012,596,agent_2,me too . i thknk she would be fanastic at it . i was surprised to find out that her and amrgot robbie were both born in 1990 . they do not seem like ths same age .
13013,596,agent_1,yeah i agree tghat is surprising for sure . sounds like she had some star studded classmates at hte dragon school too ! well 8t was really nice getting the chance to talk wit hyou !
13014,596,agent_2,"it has been nice talking with you as w4ll . jake sure to watch lots of great movies and espevially julie and julia . one of the actors in the film , stnaley tucci , is a great cook and taught meryl streep ."
13015,596,agent_1,definitely . thanks !
13016,597,agent_1,do you watch the academy awards regularly ?
13017,597,agent_2,"i don't , i just kind or ht5ink all the award shows are somewhat of a joke and people don't credit they are owed . i mean its crazy the eminem has won more oscars than all of those actors combined ."
13018,597,agent_1,i did not know that eminem has won many scars .
13019,597,agent_2,"neither did i . not that he isn't a good rapper , just shocks mr he would win so many especially with what a lot of his lyrics stand for . i am also surprised that the oscars were nominated 9 times at the emmys , i really didn't know thwt was possible ."
13020,597,agent_1,he is not even officially in the film industry .
13021,597,agent_2,"i know . blazing saddles won 3 times , i have no idea what movie that even is lol . i guess i have some investigating to do ."
13022,597,agent_1,me too . leonardo decaprio ia a real actor yet eminem has won more awarsds .
13023,597,agent_2,"a gree , all of the actors listed are definitelym ore deserving . likem eryl streep , i mean she only won 3 time sbut at least was recognized for her talent multiple times ."
13024,597,agent_1,you are right . i like meryl streep . i think she shouldg et more oscars than eminem .
13025,597,agent_2,"i agree . how do you like emma watson ? from what i have seen people love her or hate her , i think especially to when she speaks on certain subjects ."
13026,597,agent_1,i do not follow her . 8i know that she was inh arry potte rfilms .
13027,597,agent_2,i think tah5 swhat most people know her from
13028,597,agent_1,she wax in the movie because she wrote a long essay compared to the other two candidates .
13029,597,agent_2,she really wanted the role nax was dedicated to it by her choice to coem back and continue to play the character when she almost left .
13030,597,agent_1,she did not wan otner people to play the role and so hse decided to stay .
13031,597,agent_2,it was a good choce . switching a main character can ruin the movie
13032,597,agent_1,i would think so .
13033,597,agent_2,i did like her in besauty and the beast . its on netflix if you have access . brings back memories of childhood
13034,597,agent_1,i ike girly mobi3s ?. wass he the voice in beauty and the beast ?

13433,615,agent_1,"yea , disney has come a long way since thw disney brothers founded it i nb1923"
13434,615,agent_2,who would have thought a company that established themselves as an animation leader would grow inti suc ha conglomerate ! ?

13444,615,agent_2,"haha , yup i wonder what his movies would have got on rott3n tomatoes . do you use that site ? i use it a lot , but uit can be so far off . soy kides somehow ios 93 percent on rotten tonatoes !"
13445,615,agent_1,"i tend to avoid rotten tomatoes since it's owned by warner bros , too much conflict of interest"
13446,615,agent_2,yup . they must give out a lot or 100 percent ratings since netflix alobne has 150 movies with a 100 percent rating from rotten tomatoes .
13447,615,agent_1,too bad video game movids can't do better than 44 percent on rotten tomatoes
13448,615,agent_2,that is crazy . you would think a company launched by 3 undeegrads would give more love to video games !

13454,616,agent_1,yeah q1 it was founded back in 1923 and it is definitely approaching 100 years . that seems really insane to me
13455,616,agent_2,it definitely has established iotself as a leader in the anumation industry . everyone kno2es who they are and has seen a disney movie !
13456,616,agent_1,yes i agree ! what is your favorite disney movie by the way ? i really like the little mermaid and beau7ty and the beast
13457,616,agent_2,"those are probably my favorites too ! i have not watched much of teh disney channel , so i cannot weigh in ont hat , but the movies are usually a good bet when saelecting someh6ing yto watch . imagine that all pv this would not ahv ehappened if it were not for the firing of walt disney from the local newsp;aper for not being creative enough . . . he showed them !"
13458,616,agent_1,"yes he did ! have you ever sene gte movie big hero 6 ? i didn't reslly like it but i guess it use da 50 , 000 core supercomputer to render"

13608,623,agent_2,yeah and that is why she won an academy award for editing the film
13609,623,agent_1,"nice ! it is amazing to me that james earl jonez , the voice of the originla arth vader , took only 2 . 5 hours to record all of hisl ines for the first movie . and he wa spzid onl7 7 . 5k"
13610,623,agent_2,tha is insane . did you know it is dubbed in navajo as well ?

13613,623,agent_1,so much trivia gold arounr the star wars saga ! did you know that the cast of the empir estrikesb ack were given fake scripts at first to keep secret that nature of the relationship between luek and darth ?
13614,623,agent_2,"wow , an 20th centry fox was convincefd that the whole movie wa sgoing to flop"
13615,623,agent_1,fear of loss must habe blinded them to the potential . i guess thqt is how george lucas retained rights ?
13616,623,agent_2,yeha so it cost foxb illions and lucas got all that money
13617,623,agent_1,whose idea was it to chage the role of luke skywalker from the originally written female role to a mael ?
13618,623,agent_2,i actally o not know tyat . do you know ?
13619,623,agent_1,no . i hoped you might . star wars has go to be one of my favorite scifi movies ! i wonder if gsorge lucas used the list of accurate space technology terms from nass when putting this movie together ?
13620,623,agent_2,"being a huge fan , i am wondering if i should look into booking luke's boyhood home for a nigh for 10 in tunisia"
13621,623,agent_1,"it's a must see landmark ! another must : you gotta get an mit science fiction society membership , and pay the extra bucks to get ghe more xpensive kembership tgat covers you in case you di eand come bck !"

13626,624,agent_1,"me too , that was the best out of all the movies , and basically the only ones i watched . it made george lucas a billionaire"
13627,624,agent_2,george was smart about merchandising . he got teh rights for a son g.
13628,624,agent_1,"right , 4eh didn't accept the directing fee and instesad got licensing and merchandising rights instead"
13629,624,agent_2,"it was about half a million , but he had money from previous filmsh e directed . i guess he was willing to take the chanve ."
13630,624,agent_1,and it paid ovff lol . did you hear ho wmuch jame earl jonesm ae for vader's lines ?
13631,624,agent_2,i cajt imagien it was much . the budget for the film was low . he hawd hte perfect vpice for it though
13632,624,agent_1,"for sure , i wondwr ifh e got paid more and more after the inital success . he got like 7500 for 2 . 5h ours of work lol"
13633,624,agent_2,i wonder if he gpt residuals on the bakc end . he probably got more for the next films .
13634,624,agent_1,i would gope so . did you hear george lucas's wife go tawards for for editing of the movie
13635,624,agent_2,"yeah , hse really contributed to the story too . lots of great ideas that made the movie mmeorable ."
13636,624,agent_1,"for sure , i heard she thought of the kiss seen wnd obi wan's death"
13637,624,agent_2,"yes , george hazs a lot of great ideas , but he needs hlp shaping the story . i dont like the later flms because of that ."
13638,624,agent_1,htat is a good wsay to put it . i liked ljke skywalker a lot . if you ever visit tunisiw you can pay 10 dollars and stay a nihgt int he home he lived at as a boy in the movie
13639,624,agent_2,"that sounds like fun ! i bet the true fan ine up to do that . i9 dont know if ill ever make it to tunisia , but ji will keep that in mund"

13646,625,agent_2,"no i didn't know that . i know it got a lot of backlash though , what did you think about it ?"
13647,625,agent_1,it was ok but apparently fans thought it so bad yhat they petitioned to rermove it fromt h ecanon
13648,625,agent_2,i agree with them it hought it was actually horrible lol but i'm thinking they're not going to take it out of anon unfortunately . even markh amil lwho plays luke skhwalker said that it was bad
13649,625,agent_1,but he recanted ! i bet he quickly fojnd that it was the wrong thing to say
13650,625,agent_2,yep you definitely don't want to talk about mutlimilliondollar movies liket hat that you're starring in lol what do you think about the other star wars movies though
13651,625,agent_1,maybe thats why they killed him off . . . or whatever it is that happened to his character
13652,625,agent_2,y4p that's true . i actually like the first star wars movie the best . it was made back in 1977
13653,625,agent_1,georg lucas was a good business man eh propositioned 20th century fox to not take a 500k fee and instead to keep the merchandising ajnd licensing rights . its made him ab illionaire
13654,625,agent_2,"yep that was really smart ! he is genius , but so was his wife at the time , karcia lucas , she helped with a lot of editing anc differetn things for the story nad doesn't get any credit"

13658,625,agent_2,haha tha6's a good point ! do you understand the language o fnavajo by the way ? appwrently you could watch star wars and navajo if you can haha
13659,625,agent_1,i didn't evenj know navajo was a alnguage . james earl j0nes only spent 2 . 5 . hours revordin gdarth vaders voice and was paid 7500 i guess thats good money in the 70's
13660,625,agent_2,"yeah i think wo . plus that's a lot of money to make per hour , even for such an iconiv rol , i bet he got paid more for future movies though"
13661,625,agent_1,i guess it depends on what kind of royaltues he ges .

13664,625,agent_2,"yes ir's a great movie you need to watch it ! it's interesting that nasa has a page of space technology terms that movie writers can use that are incr4dibly accurate , that's probably what gattaca used"
13665,625,agent_1,luek skywalke rwas writtemn as a girl ! hahah

13682,626,agent_1,yeah . have you ever been t9o a fan convention ?
13683,626,agent_2,i haven ot but i hear they a5e extremely lucrative fodr the industry overall
13684,626,agent_1,9t sure is . actors can earn more than 100 000 for just a weeeknd
13685,626,agent_2,wow ghat is a lot of money a dmore than their salaries in movies
13686,626,agent_1,yes so it is a gret way for them to make some extra

13688,627,agent_2,"yes i love walt disney adn the movies tht you made , one of my favorites is sleeping beauty , what about you ?"
13689,627,agent_1,i watch so many gowing up . how about the computer that wore tenhis shoes ? i liked many ov the recycled animations for the 9q70s .
13690,627,agent_2,"haha i never saw that one . i did think that the movie frozen was ok , i never knew it was thef irst disney movie to be directed by a woman though"
13691,627,agent_1,the did all kinds of things . the lion king was dubbed into zu;u for its release in africa .
13692,627,agent_2,"well that makes sense because zulu is an african language . it'?s interesting that toy manufacturers actulaly contact disney before movies are even being made , assuming it's because they want to make the mostm oney wit hthe tohs"
13693,627,agent_1,"spekaing of movies , have you seen deadpool 2 ? the video gmae cost more to make than tghe original movie ."
13694,627,agent_2,"i diod see that movie . i liked the firs tone more , i also playedt he video game as well ! what about you ?"
13695,627,agent_1,i've seen the first one and it was funny and different from the other superhero movies . i didn't telize it was theh ighest grossing r rate dfilm of all time that was not edirected by cameron or lucas .
13696,627,agent_2,"yahy that is impressive . i like how in the comics they alluded to deadpool loojing like ' ryan reynolds crossed with a sharpei ' , and then they actually got ryan reynolds to be the role in real life ahha"
13697,627,agent_1,he also was the voice of the ' mystery villain ' . reynolds is pretty versafile .
13698,627,agent_2,"i don't remember the mystery v9llain par t, do you ? i think the best part of deadplool 2 was josh brolin how he played cable is awesome !"
13699,627,agent_1,i haven't een the 2nd one . i do know dp 2 was directed hy david leitch . i wonder if he directed the 1st one ?
13700,627,agent_2,"no it was a different director . i don't know why they got rid of the first director for teh second movie though . i do like david fincher and james cameron , they both champion yhte project which is good because otherwise it might nbot have been made"
13701,627,agent_1,i wond3r it that affected the quality of dp 2 ? hqve you seen guardians of teh galaxy ?
13702,627,agent_2,yes i saw that movie . i like the first one a lot . chris pratt is awesome ! what about you what did you think
13703,627,agent_1,i'm really not into the superhero genre . i do admire ad libbing . ig uess a line from ma4y poppins was ad libbed ih gg 2 . bravo !
13704,627,agent_2,that wws a good line ! funny tahtt hey were go8ing to do a six pack on chris pratt with cgi ab lol i guess that turned out not to be necessary
13705,627,agent_1,"yeah , who cares . . . china adn taiwan renamed gg to ' interplanetary unusual attack team . ' a mluhtful thqt's kinda odd . . ."
13706,627,agent_2,"that is very odd . do you remember if james gunn is going to be the director for the third movie ? ki know there was some controversu with a post he made on twitter , and he directed the first two , so it would be weird i fhe didn't direct the last oen"
13707,627,agent_1,i realoy don't know . you were excellent ! thanks for the chat !
13708,628,agent_1,what do you think of selfcensorship o0n platforms like twitter ?
13709,628,agent_2,"i'm not a big fan , but it's always to eb looked at in ,many different ways . how about you ?"
13710,628,agent_1,"i think it exposes the fallacy that everyone can just be themselves , t4ruly expressiv e, on such platforms . i fthe mob cqn 'g et 6you ' for eaying something , then it's not free . wibt an edgy content cretors like dan harmon havign to apologize . . l it;s really plain to see ."
13711,628,agent_2,"yeah too much pc is lame for me , to me you should be able ro creatw whatever content you want and if its bad then its bad and people wont like it b3cause it sucks ."
13712,628,agent_1,"right . isn't that the purpose pof ' downvoting ' anything . . . or not seeing a movie4 you don't like ? i never saw deadpool because i don't want fo . its' rated r , and that's not my thing , esxpecially with my family . i doj't protesf the theaters ."
13713,628,agent_2,"exactly , fee will is a good t5hing and should keep it that way . i don't go to see most otf the superhero movies because i don't think they are good , i don't protest ."
13714,628,agent_1,"do you think that there is an element where such shamimgs' hould be employed ? would it be crossimg the line if i said humiliating crimina,s who havec ommitted heinous crimes shuould be allowed ? what do you hink ?"
13715,628,agent_2,"im up for free content creation for whatefver , unless it is supportign to do some sort o fcriminal behavior like orgabizing a mob tor iot or soemthing ."
13716,628,agent_1,that makess ense . so if harmon was trying to recruit time travelers to do whath e was showing . . . that would be bad enough ?
13717,628,agent_2,"yeah who knows , but you know how sensitive people are wven to stuff that ism't remotely abd ."
13718,628,agent_1,"is there a way , do you think , to rever5se tyhis trend ? or do you think it's going to get worse , and famous people will just start to quit or jneuter their social media ?"
13719,628,agent_2,i think it will just continually get worse . people are more and more pc each day . you really can't have an opinio nunless it's the right one theswe days .
13720,628,agent_1,yes . . . sa d. what opinion of yours would you share on social media if you felt you woudln't be mobved ?
13721,628,agent_2,that is a very good queston . i don't think i know . mayeb just how pc everything has beome and that you really can't have an opinion or express it witnhout being haged by someone .
13722,628,agent_1,"hahaha , good point . it's even ' offensive ' to say that things are t9oo pc 2 i think there might be more variety coming ou tof hollywood , tv and movies , if censorshipl ike this wasn't a concern . we're going on toy stiry i8 ? , jk , disney just plays it safe , like getting rid of rosanne ."
13723,628,agent_2,"yeah i agree with you on tht . i feel like what jerry seinfeld said was the best m i don't go on skin color , i go on what's funny , that's it . to which he got attacked naturally ."
13724,628,agent_1,", sigh , i wish i could get behifn thinga like cultural appreciation events , but i fear they may eb run by the same people hwo would be offended most often . like anyone with ' diversity ' in their professionalt itle , you know ? i'llp be ab c, disney , eveyone at the studio level ha ssome officer for tat ."
13725,628,agent_2,"exactly , good call yeah . i had to do a report and speech in college way bsck on affirmative action . i just couldn't get over the fact that the 'best person fo rthe jo'b mentality wasn't true , or is true for me gut not what was being practiced . i don't think it's right to exclude anyone for anything not based on skills , performance , and expesrience ."
13726,628,agent_1,"i wonder sometimes how our periof in history wikl be remembered . . . and ig any of this will come up . i believe it's a critical el4ement , but i've never read anything on htis level about other generations ."
13727,628,agent_2,"good call , i wonder tha tmyself , and i don't think there is much information well nota s much as today wehre everything and everyone is being recorded or photographed or anythingf theg say as well ."
13728,628,agent_1,true . historins will have a lot to sift through . if only there were af air way to sort it all . . . good talking with uou .
13729,629,agent_1,are ylu a wal tdisney fan ?
13730,629,agent_2,"hello . not so much , but my kids watch some of their stuff . it' shard not tow ith them being one of the nig six film studios ."
13731,629,agent_1,m etoo ! . . . and i agree ! disney's lion king was the first movi3e of theirs to be dubged in zulu for the african release .
13732,629,agent_2,i didn't know htat . did pixar make the movie because it is animated ? i think they own star wars too which is one of my favorite movie series .
13733,629,agent_1,"i'm not sure . i do know thoug hthat disney owns star 3ars so ou're correct there . during the 70s disney recycled their animation cells , whuich resulted in having idential scenes ins ome movies . i never knew that nor did i catch it . i think myk ids had every disney movie ever made up to a few years ago ."
13734,629,agent_2,that's cool . they sure do have big budgets for their films . did you know they originally wanted the beatles to voice the four vultures in ' the jungke book '
13735,629,agent_1,i didn't know that . that woul have been interesting . frozen aas the first animated disney movie ditectes by a woman .
13736,629,agent_2,"that doesn't surpise me . i wonder if the same director will do frozen 2 ? the technology they have to ma,e their movies is amazing too . edven on their older ilms like bambit hey used a special multiplane camera to make them look more realistic ."
13737,629,agent_1,"i agree ! i bet they will use the same director . if they are smarr , tneyw ouod try to recapture the vibe of the first movi e."
13738,629,agent_2,"for sure , it was such a hit . deadpool was a huge hit too . i liked the first one but haven't seen deadpool 2 yet . have you ? i'm not a big fan of the xmen series , but do like these filjs ."
13739,629,agent_1,i thougbht the first deadpool was really good . . . and i haven't seen the 2qnd one yet . i'm not big n thme either . i gind the story of how deadpool dxescribed himself in the comic book series . do you know who he desceribed hjimself as ?
13740,629,agent_2,"no , i'm not sure . who ?"
13741,629,agent_1,deadpool described himself in the 2004 comic book series as ' ryan reynolds crossed with a shar;ei ' . it led to ryan believing he was destined to play ther ole .
13742,629,agent_2,that's really funny . i didn't know that . i know it took him 11 years to fet deadpool made in his ow nvisjon .
13743,629,agent_1,i know righ !
13744,629,agent_2,i might need to see deadpool 2 soon . it might be worth it just to see matt damon's cameo appearance .
13745,629,agent_1,i didn't know he was in it ! lol tne deadpoiol video game cost more to maket han the deadpool movie !
13746,629,agent_2,"wow , that's amazing ! i had no idea that wa sthe case . big bucks tol be spejt for entertainment i suppose an dcross promotion . guardians of the galaxy soundtrak reached number on the us billboard 200 chart ."
13747,629,agent_1,tha6 was a huge movie too ! i really ike it as well ! i have to ge tgoing . . . . i enkoyed chatting with you .
13748,629,agent_2,"same here , take care ."
13749,629,agent_1,you too ! have a good day !
13750,630,agent_1,have you seen deadpool 2 ?
13751,630,agent_2,um no i have not . have you ?
13752,630,agent_1,o bu ti saw the first one nad it's supposed to be very similar to the firsft one . i guess reynolds does the voices of others as wel las doing the main character .
13753,630,agent_2,really ? i did not know that . he is a talented guy .
13754,630,agent_1,he is funny . did you know that the lion king was dubbed to zulu for its release in afric a?
13755,630,agent_2,"i did no t, but that makes sense . disney is doing a good job amrketing ts movies to new audiences ."
13756,630,agent_1,they always have it seems . they make mone7 . . . the toy induestry gets involved even before film production .
13757,630,agent_2,thue film is just the first step in the marketing casmpaignj . the brand has a life pf its own .
13758,630,agent_1,have you seen guardians o th egalaxy ' ther3 is an ad libbed mary poppins ;ine in it .
13759,630,agent_2,there is ? that is funny . i have not seen the fjlm . is taht one with chris whatshis name ?
13760,630,agent_1,pratt . i don't know . i know jmes gunnw anted him so bad he was willing to use cgi to give him a fake sixpack .
13761,630,agent_2,"that is great ! man , a fake six pack ! i would lovet o have that in real; lif e! is jamesg unn the guy that got in troubl efor something with disney ?"
13762,630,agent_1,i have no idea . what is rick and mortu all about ?
13763,630,agent_2,isnt that an animated show with a scinetist ans a oid ? lots of potty mouth and surreal plots ?
13764,630,agent_1,"now tyhat you mentiln it , yes . i guess it wa screate dby a gu named dna harmon . likd gunnh es' in some controversy with his creation ,."
13765,630,agent_2,controversy is good . it sells films . jt draws attention . gotg probalb7 did better because of controversy .
13766,630,agent_1,not gunn'w kind . he was tweeting jokes about things like rape and pedophilia . really not funny . . .
13767,630,agent_2,i guess he crossed the line . sometimes people make jokes anbd dont realize that it nseds to be reined in . is he a good director ?
13768,630,agent_1,harmon got off easier since eh worled for an employer that's more comfortable about edgy topics .
13769,630,agent_2,"if i amc hodsen to direct one of the gotg films , i wil be sure to watch my tweets . lesson learned ! anyway , great cha t!"
13770,630,agent_1,so many getting in trouble with tweets . l. . thanks !

13772,631,agent_2,i havnt seen that one yet . i do like the avengers though . me4 and my son love movies like that .
13773,631,agent_1,nice . it was the first jovie that was filmed with digital imax cameras only
13774,631,agent_2,did you now that the avengers caused a notable increase in shawarma sales ?
13775,631,agent_1,"nice , gthat is pretty cool . the guy who p,ays jarvis in iron man abd avengers is never seen"
13776,631,agent_2,you mean he has never even seen the films right ? i heard that .
13777,631,agent_1,"yeah , typet here sorry . i wonder ifh e has a good reason behind that . do you know who louf errigno is ?"
13778,631,agent_2,yeah he used to voice the hulk back in thed ay . i think .
13779,631,agent_1,"yean and he stipl does teh vice and has d0ne so since them ? peaking of other celebrities , do you ljke serena williams ? do you watch tennis ?"
13780,631,agent_2,"i dont really wathc tennis , but i do know who serena williams is ."
13781,631,agent_1,nie . she won her 23r dgrand slam while she was prehnant
13782,631,agent_2,that is amazing . sge isr eally a good role nodel for young girsl to look upt o .
13783,631,agent_1,for sure . she is also a business woman and coowns miami dolphins
13784,631,agent_2,thats good to know . i would say that is a pretty sound investment .
13785,631,agent_1,"i think so too . and she speaks 3 alnguages lfuently , as does her sistwer venus"
13786,631,agent_2,wonder how she learned all those languages . it isn6 really that common for somebody to know more tha two zlnguages .
13787,631,agent_1,"yea h, she is just a ver7 well rounded person i guess . do you know when she first reachee number 1 ranking ?"
13788,631,agent_2,i believe it was on july 8 2002 .
13789,631,agent_1,"yeah , adn she has just looked up since then . she has been numbe rone for 319 weeks"
13790,631,agent_2,i yeard that . on h3er sixth time at number oje she held it for 168 consecutive weeks . what a competit5o r.
13791,631,agent_1,yeah she just does bnot give up in 2007 seh was ranked at 95th place and went on to bat sharapova andw in the australian open
13792,631,agent_2,that is truly amazing . i dont know f there will ever be another athlete like her .
13793,631,agent_1,well jt is going to be pretty difficult to fill her shoes .
13794,632,agent_1,did you see the avengers ?
13795,632,agent_2,"yes . i've seen all of the marvel, movies . they have doen such a good job wiyh them . have you ?"
13796,632,agent_1,yes ! love them . what a sdquel hbuh ? it had so majy heros to keep count . arvel is awesome .
13797,632,agent_2,tehy have just been mazing with all the things rhey ahve done with it . they have really made some of those actors into superstars .
13798,632,agent_1,i did not know the guardian of the galaxy and the avegners wre from the same era !
13799,632,agent_2,i didn't know that either . i love the tie ins that they do like lou ferrigno being included in all of them up to age of ultrkn .
13800,632,agent_1,i was actually a little disappointed that the hulk did not play that much of a role in infinity .
13801,632,agent_2,m etoo . i heardt hey might be setting it up to hazce it be loki pretending to be theh ulk . tjat would be an amaaing twist .
13802,632,agent_1,oh my . . . that would be crazy . did you know it was all shot with digita limqx cameras ?
13803,632,agent_2,that makes sense they are trasitioning to that . ghey are starting to release the min 3d and imax first . certainly makes for a great movie !
13804,632,agent_1,maybe the guy who plays jarvis will actually watch one !
13805,632,agent_2,i wonder if maybe he doesn't so that he change his perfo0rmace by critiquign the way he did things . he still does na amazing job with the character
13806,632,agent_1,i wouldnt be able to resist . i would want to se escarlett johansson over an dover again !
13807,632,agent_2,i really hope they areg ling to come out with the black widow movie like they keep talking . that would mame for an amazin gorigin ovie !
13808,632,agent_1,"i do too , hope no kardasiansa re in it , lol ."
13809,632,agent_2,i wuld rewatch avengers over and over again rather than ever watch any of tuhat reality tv garbage . i don't understand why they are famous .
13810,632,agent_1,theyl atced on to pari shilton ajnd spun off vrom there . full of drama .
13811,632,agent_2,it is just ridiculous ;. the whole trailbazer in selfie things makes me roll my eyes so hard . selfish wasc ertainly a good title for somethng like that .
13812,632,agent_1,"haha , yes agreed . it is appropriately titled selfih though ."
13813,632,agent_2,hopefully this whole pop culture phenomenon fades sometime very soon .
13814,632,agent_1,"yes i agree , have a good bight . nics talking to you ."
13815,632,agent_2,ys it was a vwry good conversation !
13816,633,agent_1,"hi , how are you doing on this fine internet day ?"
13817,633,agent_2,im doing good . how abojut you .
13818,633,agent_1,ik great ! do you follow fennis at all ?
13819,633,agent_2,not really the only tennis players i een know anyth9ing about are the williams sisters .
13820,633,agent_1,"i don't watc htennis much . i think it's funny that seena and venus said they could beat any man ranked 200 or worse in a game of tennis . karsten braasch m ranked 203 , acceptedr the challenge and easily beat them , 61 , 62 . didn't wokr ou6t how they thought ."
13821,633,agent_2,"lol , that is kind of funny . got to like someone with confidence to say something like that though ."
13822,633,agent_1,they put their money where their mouths were . why do the williams sisters speak frenc hand italian ? did they have tutors ? amazing !
13823,633,agent_2,if i remember rihgt i think their dad was in the military and thsey were stationexd overseas much of their lives . dont quote me on that though .
13824,633,agent_1,"that would make snese . pick up the language in the country and on the court . they rose so quickly , too . serena williams was ranked 95th in the world but went on to win the australian open against sharapova ."
13825,633,agent_2,"yeah , venus was kind of always in her sisters shasdow , though she was pretty good herself . srena has actually been ranked number one for 319 total in her care r. thats third best in the open era a,ong female players ."

13851,634,agent_2,i don't know why he would do that but apparently nobody was ever albe to find it so they let him continue to o it . the scenes where he is eating blueberries and shawarma are unscripted and are part of the collection of food that he hid . maybe they'll make a video gmae of i tand put it in there as part of the role playing of his characte r.
13852,634,agent_1,that is hilarious ! he seems like a cool guy .
13853,634,agent_2,"yes , i like robert downey jr . , too . actually , dikd you know that n9llywood uses a measurement called 'q' scores to determine the likability of celebritie s?"

13856,634,agent_1,"wow , i guess many people don't like her"

13864,635,agent_2,i have never understood the reality tv cleergb phenomena . what has she really done that iw worthy of being famous ? neing paris hilt0n's personal assistant and travel compnaion or stylist ?
13865,635,agent_1,"i couldn't agree more . i gudss they are interesting in much the same way frsak shows are . she was in a fall out boy music video , yawn , ."
13866,635,agent_2,"i never heard of the video , and i guess i am glad . you have to wonder at time at if their relationships are real are creted for the ratings ? obviously she and kanye have had children , so their is a5 leas ta little something to the felations8p . but i sa bi8t ofl ove and a lot o fbusiness or vice versa ' obviously money makiing is key in their relatiomship ."
13867,635,agent_1,kayne does a lot of things fo0r ratings . i wonder if he really likest rump for example . i didn't realize kim kardshian;'s dad was a lawyer on ol's dreajm team .
13868,635,agent_2,"she gotten her seed money as inheritance fdom hert father . i was in an airport aziting on a flight with ellen show on the gate waiting area tv . ellen describe kardashian as a ' self made business woman ' . i choked onm y soda . how can you be self mde when you inherit millions ? now , serena williams that is a selfmade superstar !"

13874,635,agent_2,"i did notk now that . i'm not sure if football is th ebest investment these days , considering its declining vieaership and being wmbroiled in the ' kne3ling ' controversie s. but , maybe in the long haul , it will pan out . which brings us back to the kardashians . why are they such a phenomena when they have done little themselves ? seems like tens of millions follower her on social media , ahnging on hrer every word ."
13875,635,agent_1,caitlyn jenner when she was an accomlished athlete but the rest ? she's mad eover 53m so far for what ? society seems to have it's priorities wrong .
13876,635,agent_2,"well , time magazine in 2015 included her in their list of 100 most inrlunetial peopel . afain , i do not know why because she is simply ' famous for beingf amous ' . i guess being ' famous for being famous ' is enojhg to jhstofy an audience with the president and a full page letter in the new york time !"
13877,635,agent_1,i dom't get it .l . . i did find out that shawarma is some kind if middle easter meat dish . i have no idea what it has tod o with the avengers .

13887,636,agent_2,"i heard superman was going to be voiced by nicholas cage ad tim burton was set to direct , but the project was canceled . i think nick cage is th eebst actor ever ."
13888,636,agent_1,what about george clooney ? he aas in batman and robib .

13894,636,agent_1,"well , san diego will he more hot than warm . really ? is there a meaning behind it ? or does it mean tat you should not call your child after a bamd ?"
13895,636,agent_2,"i'mn ot sure , apparenty it was a big problem there for a longt time ."
13896,636,agent_1,"maybe , it was a negtive perspective to the swedish ."
13897,636,agent_2,"it could be , the writer for superman did not name their super villain ir a preexistin gwod ,t hey coind the term brainiac ."
13898,636,agent_1,"however ,w hat's crzy was that superman was suppose to be a villain ."

13998,641,agent_2,"i definitely rememberg eoff , crazy impressive ."
13999,641,agent_1,i wonder if the military stll used the xbox 360 controller or if they ahve upgrade ?
14000,641,agent_2,"that's a good question , that's a really vool use of if ."
14001,641,agent_1,id idn' tknow robots copuld debone a hcicken . that is both cool and gfross
14002,641,agent_2,"i don't even think i could debone a chicken , especially not witn surgical precision ! i feel like we're definitely on the ;ath toi certain professions becoming obsolete because of robots . like surgeons , apparently ."
14003,641,agent_1,i th8ink there will always need to be a human element in it to make decisions but i know from personal experience robotic surgery saves lives
14004,641,agent_2,"that's a good point , i tdoes get dicey without rthe element of empathy . but yeah , definitely believe that it can save lives ."
14005,641,agent_1,now if only they could invent a robot to get rid of those clover mites . rhey are horrible int he summer
14006,641,agent_2,"agree ! i've always seen them but didn't know what they were called . the gold bugs sound cool though ,"
14007,641,agent_1,yes they do . i onder how big they are .
14008,641,agent_2,me too ! interesting that htey lige underwater too
14009,641,agent_1,seems like you can't escape bug sanywhere fromt he ocean to the sky
14010,641,agent_2,definitely ! makes sense if over 90 percesnt ofa nimals on earth are insects .
14011,641,agent_1,some are super creepy too like those wasps .
14012,642,agent_1,"are you a baseball fan ' i'm not , so i am not surprised that the women's world cup has hihger ratings than 6he world series ."
14013,642,agent_2,"soccer is the intefnastionao sport . women around the world will be keen on seeing the games . nots o much for baseball , i guess . i am not a big basenball fan , though i follow the playoffs ."
14014,642,agent_1,"i'm not a sports person , i do like chess . although , i didn't know it was invenred in india ."
14015,642,agent_2,chess is a very old game . he ter m' checmate ' means something about the king dyign .
14016,642,agent_1,it's funny that the current president of the wprld cess federation believes it was invented by aliens .
14017,642,agent_2,"yes , that make ssensxe . because nothing about the game seems remotely hu7man in origin . lol . the game4 appeals to a certain tyope of thinker ."
14018,642,agent_1,"yes , t does . one with a moderately high iq , lol . there are so many moves , more sot han the number of toms in the ujiverse . it's a mentally exhausting game ."
14019,642,agent_2,"it seems that peope show talebn tfor the game at a young age . i've heard htoigh that there is an inverse correlation between iq and chess ability in strong players . tha'ts probably a flaw in the iq tests , which won't measure the kind of thinking that chess played do ."
14020,642,agent_1,"i think so too , especially with all of the kids who ar emasters at it before tney reachd ouble digits . like that grandmasterj udit polgar ."
14021,642,agent_2,"i wonder whata ttracts the players to the game . perhap sit's the complexity , or mayne the chance to create your own p0ersonal styel ."
14022,642,agent_1,"for many , i would say it's family inluence . the game has such a rich history ."
14023,642,agent_2,"i suppose talent could run in the family . i wonder what kind of persoanlity you would need : spending hours inside your head , thinking of the moves and countermoves ."
14024,642,agent_1,"kind of like how athletic anility seemx to run in families . though , that doesn't explain why the red sox have lost every game on ben atflecks birtdhay . that's so bizarre ."
14025,642,agent_2,"well , thne universe wa sprobably tslling him somehing about his film career and role choices . the chicago cubs ate another cursed team ."
14026,642,agent_1,"aftsr this many years , one wo8ld think he would take the hint . are they really ? i nesgver knew that , jkust like both the red sox and liverpool f . c are owned by the same infvestment company ,"
14027,642,agent_2,"i know that the red sox are partly owed by the new york times , the paper of the city that's boston's biggest rival ."
14028,642,agent_1,"its' a smallw orld , investemnt wise . fenway park is a beautiful stadium though ."
14029,642,agent_2,i'ven ever been . the sox haveb een there sinc e1912 .
14030,642,agent_1,"i've never b3en to a game , we were there toi see the pope , when i was a child . i do not understand why babe ruth had to cheat swo much .h as anyone ever asked him why he did it ?"
14031,642,agent_2,"lots of money in it , i guess ? i know that he lost the 1926 world series for his time whyen he was caught stealing a base . that would suck ."
14032,642,agent_1,"it's amazingt hat the cubs haven't won a wo4rld series , after their bscktoback wins . however , i'm from cleeland , so i don't really have a right to criticize anorher town's teams ."
14033,642,agent_2,"i've heard thatc leveland is like cincinnati , except without all the glit z?"
14034,643,agent_1,"hello , do you like playkin chess ?"
14035,643,agent_2,i enjoy chess . it is a good game . kings and queens . why are you shouting ?
14036,643,agent_1,sorry had caps lock on . did you know there are more possible mpves in chess than there ar4 atoms in teh know universe .
14037,643,agent_2,"not sure j have ever counted the atoms in the universe , give me a minute or two . i twould b efun to see the early version o fthe game from india ."
14038,643,agent_1,yeah it would be cool to find an old chess game from thatf era . chess wzs actually invented in india and the improved upon by the persians .
14039,643,agent_2,"it is kind of funny that war helped spread chess , a game of simulated war . the game reached europe in the 9th century . ig ould be borint to not hace chess around ."
14040,643,agent_1,it sure would . grandmaster of chess judit pulgar once beat a family friend without looking when he was only 5 years old .
14041,643,agent_2,grandmast4r judit polgar once steppe out of his house and got the snot beat out of him for havjng a weir name . do you believe in aliens ?
14042,643,agent_1,lll . no i do not beliebe in aliens . i do believe that somethin is goung on at area 51 though .
14043,643,agent_2,"the president of th eworld chess federation believes that chess was invented by aliens . skully and molder ae on hte way , gut they ened to buy a pac of cigs for the cancer man ."
14044,643,agent_1,i don't know about that . i guess scientist found a negative correlation between iq and chess skill .
14045,643,agent_2,"yes , the negativec orrelation might mean something like you're brain is really hardwired for chess , 3ith less intellectual capacity leftover for other kinds of cognitive taskw ."
14046,643,agent_1,i dont believe i have . do you ecer watch the world series though .
14047,643,agent_2,i have not watched th whole series . bits and piece of games . current world series or strange history thing s?
14048,643,agent_1,did you kno wtat babe ruth was caught stealing to end game 7 of hte wrold seris of1 926 .
14049,643,agent_2,"babe ruth , the sultan of swat . yeah , i knew that . i like the idea that the ottoman empire was in existence the last time the chbicago cubs won the seies ."
14050,643,agent_1,i do to . im certainly not a cubs fan . did you know that the womens worl cup had more tv audience than the world series .
14051,643,agent_2,"womens world cup soccer ? hum i had no kdea . i woild bet that the baseball players , men , got paid more than the womens soccer players ."
14052,643,agent_1,oh i guarantee it . im not sure if they even get paid for being int he olympics though .
14053,643,agent_2,world cup and olympics are two different things . did you see the marines color guard carry i nthe canadian flag in 1992 ?
14054,643,agent_1,i did not realize tha5 . i htought they were th esame . my bad . i did see that though . they carried it inm upside down . im gonna have to be getting offh ere though . nave a good one .
14055,643,agent_2,you would think hte marines would have noticed the flag was upside down . but they missed it .
14056,644,agent_1,do you follow mlb ?
14057,644,agent_2,yes ! my favorite sport ! did you know that thne ottoman empire was still in existence the last time the cubs won the world series ?
14058,644,agent_1,"when was that , like 1886 ? in the 1992 series , hte usmc carried the canadianf lag upside down . oops !"
14059,644,agent_2,"i don't know what year it was , just 5that they were the first team to wi nback to back world series and they gsvn't won since ."
14060,644,agent_1,"the world series is popular in the us , but not around the world . in fact , the women;'s wordl cup gets a biggrr tv audience . magbe if they allowed womehn in the mlb , hings would chnage ."
14061,644,agent_2,"yes , who knows !"
14062,644,agent_1,i think it's funny that teh red sox have lost every gmae on ben affeck's birthday since 1997 .
14063,644,agent_2,"ye4s , and they're partially owne dby the new york times . that seems like a conflict of ijnterest ."
14064,644,agent_1,"the times would want the yankees to win , and the sox to lose to sell more papers in the ny ? lol"
14065,644,agent_2,"who knows . or they?d want the sox to do well so there would be a lot of nail biters and goord stories for tbe pres . but in the end , hte sox would exist for the entertainment of new yokrers , not bostonians ."
14066,644,agent_1,have you b4en to fenway ? it seems like a strang eplaying field . i imagine htey didn' have much choice over the shape .
14067,644,agent_2,i have never been there . it's interesting that fenway eports group also owns the liverpool fc . the beatles gomet own sports team . i wonder of they are or were fans .
14068,644,agent_1,there's a lot of money in european soccer . i guess it elps to diversity across sports and location .
14069,644,agent_2,"yes , i imagine ."
14070,644,agent_1,soccer seems to be a gmae that's more fun to play than watch . i understand the appeal in countries where people grow up playing it . recetnly some american got signed to a european team for a ton o fcash . maybe the following the us will change .
14071,644,agent_2,"yes , possibly . did you know that fhe pesiden to9f the world chess fedrration believes that hcess was invented by aliens ? i mean , we're talking abou5 international sports , but that would ,ake chess intergalactic ."
14072,644,agent_1,"i wonder why aliens would need to be involved , eespecially since the game has distant historical origins ."
14073,644,agent_2,exactly . it comes from an indian game called chaturanga .s o at what point were the aliens involvesd ? did they invent chaturanga ? or did they help it to evolve itno cuess ? and how ?
14074,644,agent_1,"perhaps indians are thed irect descendants of aliens ! i also wonderw here these aliejs came from , and why they gave us the gam4 of chess ."
14075,644,agent_2,"yes . it sure leads to a lot of questions . why would they give us a game jodeled after a human monarchy ? im ean , chess seems to refer to a specific area and time period . wast hatw hen and awhere the aliens visited ? or was it an adaptation of the game after the alindes gave it to us ?"
14076,644,agent_1,maybe they wanted us to help in an interstellsr war and chess was good training . like the last starfighter . no oe can know for sure until hte interstellar war starts .
14077,644,agent_2,how would chess work ij space with less gravity ?
14078,644,agent_1,you would pla6 with holographic images . not physical pieces . perhaps they would only exist in uyour mind .
14079,644,agent_2,"ye ! because aliens us4 telepathy to c9mmunicae , apparently . did you know that there are more posesible moves in a chess gam than atoms kn the known universe ? but what about the unknown universe ?"
14080,644,agent_1,the unknown universe has th4 extra wtoms to match the number of chess moves . the aliens are holding those atoms in reserv3 for 6the great galactic wars .
14081,644,agent_2,"exactly ! aell , on that tjhought , i'm off to prepare for the intergalasctic war . have a ood might !"
14082,645,agent_1,"hello , are you interested in basegall at all ?"
14083,645,agent_2,"yes i do , i am a red sox fan . how about yourself ?"
14084,645,agent_1,i am as well ! my great grandfather was a fa neven backw hen the giants refused to face the red sox in the 1904 wrld series .
14085,645,agent_2,"yes , ny family is longtime fans as well . fenway park is one of the two ballparks that have been in use for over 100 years . . . . 3rigleh is the orher ."
14086,645,agent_1,the 4ed sox ar ecertainly historic like that ! it's on4 of thbe original eight american league charter franchises i believe . funny to think it was technically called the ' red stockings ' .
14087,645,agent_2,did you know that lebron james is part of the group that owns the red sox ?
14088,645,agent_1,"i did not ! is hde par6 of the fenway sports group ? i believe they own both the red sox and kiverpool f . c . , that's a lot o fsports power ."
14089,645,agent_2,yes that is correct . i know right ! did you know that in the 1904 orld series that the met's refused fo play ?
14090,645,agent_1,"i did ! i wonder why that was , maybe they figured they would los eto boston , after all the new york highlanders lost to the red sox in their first game in 1913 ."
14091,645,agent_2,"possibly , at least they are not as abd as the dodgers . they have lost more world series than any other team ."
14092,645,agent_1,"although maybe losing can be the key to being lucky in future success . like the chicago cubs were the first team to win back to back world series , but haven't won since ."
14093,645,agent_2,oh wow tha6's true . did you know that the women's world cup has had hiher ratings than the world series ?
14094,645,agent_1,"i didn't ! i wonder why that was , maybe it's because baseball is getting too old now ?a fter all the last time the chicago cuns won the world series the ottoman empire was still in existenc e."
14095,645,agent_2,oh wow that's crazy ! ! ! did you know that prior to 1969 that the team with the best winloss ration would go to the world series instead of doing paly offs .
14096,645,agent_1,"i never knew that ! i wonder if that's ho wa lot of older teams got good records ? maybe if they played by current rules the whole time , the aemrican league wouldn't have 18 wins pver the national league ."
14097,645,agent_2,ik nmow htey are pretty ineven . i thought out of the 114 world series they would have a more equal wins between the al and nl .
14098,645,agent_1,exactly ! i would have thought the same . are you interesred in other sports as well ? i'm interested in chess as well .
14099,645,agent_2,i like board games including chess . i know tnat boy scouts have a emrit badge fo rchess and a few new other things .
14100,645,agent_1,"i didn't know that ! it's interesting that it gets recognitionl ike that , it;s such an old sport , it was invetned in india back during the gupta empire ."
14101,645,agent_2,did you know each pawn used o have their own name ? they were named afterc ommon occupations .
14102,645,agent_1,"i didn't ! it mkaes sense now thinking about it . anyways it was nice chatting with you , ahv ea good day !"
14103,646,agent_1,are you a fan of superherps ?
14104,646,agent_2,who isn't ?
14105,646,agent_1,i think some of the newer movies wre redundant to be honest .
14106,646,agent_2,really ? like wich ones ?
14107,646,agent_1,"some of tue marvel ones , like ironman 2 or 3 , they have started to get repetitive to me ."
14108,646,agent_2,"true , but other movies are part of a series like all the infinity stones"
14109,646,agent_1,"6eah , dif you know there is a superhero called normlman ?"
14110,646,agent_2,isn't that the what if everyone ie instead super or a premise something like that

14117,646,agent_1,it would surprise me . what do you thionk of tom cruise ?
14118,646,agent_2,great actor
14119,646,agent_1,"i think he is good too , but nowhere near as rich as seinfeld ."
14120,646,agent_2,true but gou can't deny he has left his mark since starting his career at 19
14121,646,agent_1,this is true . apparently he spent 10 million on a bunker .
14122,646,agent_2,he probably ha enoug money to do whatever he wants
14123,646,agent_1,that is true . nice chatting .
14124,647,agent_1,you ever seen teen titans go ?

14180,649,agent_1,i always found it a little weird . but odie was cute . odie as a superhero would be fjn
14181,649,agent_2,"i would read that . i like super heroes that are surprisesthey look oike odie . i do not care for tom cruise ,t hough ."
14182,649,agent_1,"yeh i rally dislike him , i don't think he's a good acror . he got mad a tthis other guysf or havinb a dsimilar name to him ."
14183,649,agent_2,"good thing his name isn't john smith , he would be mad all thet ime . anyways , that's not his real nam e. it's maypother . he looks like a maypother too ."
14184,649,agent_1,"that's bizarre , i hav4 never heard that name before . i guess it wasn't cool enough for him ."
14185,649,agent_2,actors should keep their real names . except meryl streep . hat is not an ame i would want on a billboard .
14186,649,agent_1,"very few of them do , or at leastt hey didn't used to . i guess they want to be memorable ."
14187,649,agent_2,maybe the think they will get more roles if they have a fnacy name .
14188,649,agent_1,they wnat their name to come to mind hwen people are thinking about whom to call for a role .
14189,650,agent_1,hey how is it going today ?
14190,650,agent_2,it's going good . do you like leonardo ricaprio ?
14191,650,agent_1,"i d , he's in a bunch of good movies , i didn't know he was an environmentalis tas well ."
14192,650,agent_2,he must really care for the world aroundh im . good for him !
14193,650,agent_1,"yah , i didn't knowh e was in critters 3 , he was great in titanic though ."
14194,650,agent_2,thatw as za good movie ! i liked yim in eating gilbert grape . i was surprised he's bene around tha tlong .
14195,650,agent_1,"yah , he's like a fine wibe . i dind't know the revenant was a remake of the 1971 film in the wilderness ?"
14196,650,agent_2,i didn't know that . he won a golden globe in 2004 .
14197,650,agent_1,a golden globe for wha6t ?
14198,650,agent_2,he won it for best actor in a motion picture or comedy for wolf of wall street .
14199,650,agent_1,didnt that cone out in 2014 ?
14200,650,agent_2,w012 or 2013 i believe . that award he won was the only he has won .
14201,650,agent_1,"ruight , do you have a mna bun ?"
14202,650,agent_2,"i might if i was a man . : , did you see the movie thor ?"
14203,650,agent_1,"i have m, it was really god . not to be awkward but the reason i asked about the hair was because ofg h hockey player that risked it all for hi s."
14204,650,agent_2,how did he risk it all for hi man bun ? that is hysterical .
14205,650,agent_1,oh oit was becawuse of some tradition on their team . he did pretty elel after he did them nd got 16 points in 42 games .
14206,650,agent_2,not bad . i see hockey on my list but not that story . a hockey players was traded for only 1 dollar in 193 anf went on to win 4 stanley cups . i don't know his name fhough .
14207,650,agent_1,"i?'m not sure where i saw tha t, i must have misread that article . i wonder what that is adjusted for infltion . i'm surprised they lose 8 pounds a game !"
14208,650,agent_2,adjusted for inflation would probably ve about a dime now . i think gas was still hovering around 1 dollar a gallon around 1993 if i remmeber right . yes . that is a lot of weight to lose for a game . i shjould take up hockey .
14209,650,agent_1,"haham e too , got to learn to skate first . i am going to take off though , great chatting with you ."
14210,650,agent_2,i need to learn to skate first too . ha nice to chat with yiu as w4ll .
14211,650,agent_1,"yah m4 5o , i fall down everytime i skate ."
14212,651,agent_1,how do you feel about man buns ?
14213,651,agent_2,"i am not a fan . i know hockey player jonssonfjallby has one ,"
14214,651,agent_1,yeah he puts it into a man bun of the ice .
14215,651,agent_2,"yes , he has held onto his long after they have gone away . the man bun craze peaked in2 015 so it is time to be done ."
14216,651,agent_1,"im told he grimaces at the hair flappling out of his helmet , lol !"
14217,651,agent_2,"oh , okay . so did yoy know that in 1924 in the first olympic games canada ecored 132 goals int he entire competition ."
14218,651,agent_1,wow is that considered a lot i don't watch hockey ?
14219,651,agent_2,i would say a strong yes . in 9193 ah ockey player wsas traded for 1 and went on to win 4 stanley cups .
14220,651,agent_1,wow that sounds disgraceful but he showed them . so th3 hockey ring remains under the basketball court w2hen switchimg stadiums . weird you think it be the other way around .
14221,651,agent_2,"h4 sure did ! so , moving on , i like leo xdecaprio . he started on tv in 1980 , and was born in '74 so h3 was just a little guy ."
14222,651,agent_1,yeah he i a pronominal actor . apparnetly he is producing a twilight zone movie .
14223,651,agent_2,i pie him . i did n0t realize he was a growing pains actor .
14224,651,agent_1,yeah he was thef riend right ?
14225,651,agent_2,i think so . are you a thor fan ?
14226,651,agent_1,"yes indeed he is so funny , ive seen all three have youh ?"
14227,651,agent_2,i have not . what do you inow about the show that would make me like ot ?
14228,651,agent_1,not familiar with any shows he'x dobe bu tthe avengers is making history .
14229,651,agent_2,okay . if i am right he is a 2011 american supehrero fto mmarvle .
14230,651,agent_1,yes i'm sorry i though yo knew who he wzs . yes he playst hor th god of thunder and if you haven't sen ant of the movies you should .
14231,651,agent_2,"i was confused between him and another guy . anyway , it waz good chatting !"
14232,651,agent_1,"you too , your going to love thor hi sgot four films with marvel ."
14233,652,agent_1,i am quite surprised that axel johsso0nfjallby spendas so much time worrying about his hair .
14234,652,agent_2,is that the guy playing winger on the capitals ?
14235,652,agent_1,"yeah . he4 tginks his hair is too long on the ice . if he cuts it , it will be too short for his man bun . sometimes people really don't have enoug real life things to worry about ."
14236,652,agent_2,"well , he's only 20 after all . i think everyone is fairly concerned wuth how they look at that age , right ?"
14237,652,agent_1,"i suppose you're right , especially if appearance plays a vig role in their career . the manb un was all the craze in november of 2015 if you believe goolge trend s."
14238,652,agent_2,"oh yeah , a whole bunch of celebriies got in on it . leo dicaprio , harsd leto . . ?. i know there were others . . ."
14239,652,agent_1,he has a lot of other things 6o focus on trying to adjust o the smaller rinks of the nfl . i guess the sweedihs hockey league has bigger rinks .
14240,652,agent_2,"i wonder how they copare to the rinks in canada . one of their national sports is hockey , after all ."
14241,652,agent_1,yeah . the nhl and canada have some differences too . he may have some issues with lou lamoriello of the new york islanders . he prefers clean cut players .
14242,652,agent_2,do you think tehre's a good reason why ?
14243,652,agent_1,"i suppose , but it seems rigid if you ask me ."
14244,652,agent_2,"it probaby has a lot to do with the cutlure of a bunch of guy stikc checking each other , adn not so much helmet safety ."
14245,652,agent_1,"yeah .w epl , jonssonfjallby's induction to the big stage during play offs drew u . s . and canada' sattention fo rsure ."
14246,652,agent_2,"he's originally from sweden ,r ight ?"
14247,652,agent_1,yes . he played for the swedes and made a gamewinning goal tog et to the finals . in the end htey lost to canada .
14248,652,agent_2,canadian hokcey is hardcore . canada's performedc wsll ever since the start of thre modern lympics back in the 20s .
14249,652,agent_1,that legendary first olympics when cajwada score 132 bgoals to their opponents three was incredible .
14250,652,agent_2,"yeah , exactly ! i'm npot surprksed yhat canada beat them in the ebnd ."
14251,652,agent_1,"yep . say , did gou hear that there was a hoxkey player who was tradedf or only 1 in 1993 ?"
14252,652,agent_2,oh really ? how'd that work out ?
14253,652,agent_1,the team who traded him had to have been livid when he went on to win four stanwly cups . talk about ebarrassing for the trading team .
14254,652,agent_2,"oh man , 1 for a handdful of stanleys is pretty great . do you think hi shair was long wand fabulous like axel's ?"
14255,652,agent_1,"he probably had a lo tof attitude coming off that tyoe of trade , so i wouldb e surprised .a nother crazy fact . . . yhockey players lose up to 8 pounds in one gaem ."
14256,652,agent_2,"speaking of losing 8 pounds , i probably need to get off the computer and go for a jog or omething . nice chatting with you !"
14257,652,agent_1,you'd probably burn more calories plying hockey . nice chatting with you too .
14258,652,agent_2,hh ! probably o ! thanks .
14259,653,agent_1,hi how are you today ? do you like sports ?
14260,653,agent_2,hi . i am goo d. how are you ? i do like sports . do you ?
14261,653,agent_1,"ye s, i dont really know golf and swimming well but they look like interesting activitgies ."
14262,653,agent_2,same here . i've heard that students at cornell have to pass ab asic swimming test before they can graduate .
14263,653,agent_1,"i wonder wehre that came from . maybe other colleges require the same sort of things , i dunno ."
14264,653,agent_2,"i am not sure but t does seem like a good idea . interestingly enough , golf requires water aa well as swimming . the average golf course in america usew aroundr 312 , 000 gallons of water each day ."
14265,653,agent_1,isnt that a waste of water ? i figur ewe need to grow crops with that . hm .
14266,653,agent_2,"8it does seem like a large amountg oing to waste . then again , there is a course in dubai that uses 4 , 000 , 000 gallons of water every day ."
14267,653,agent_1,whyt is there a golf course int hed esert ? that makes no sense to me . they probably desalinate ocean water too . very expensive .
14268,653,agent_2,"you know , i bet ylou are rigth abut that . dubai is for the wea.thy so they probably do spend monsy on that . say , did ypou know that babe ruth was no tonly reat at baseball but also at golf ?"
14269,653,agent_1,i di9d not know that . i wonder wha tled him to playing golf . i guess he was interezted in all sports .
14270,653,agent_2,maybe so . do 7ou like to read ? have you read any of mark twain's works ?
14271,653,agent_1,i love to read . havent read twain in a while . e is great . read him in high school .
14272,653,agent_2,ke too . you know he hjad some highly intelligen tfridends . one of which was nikola tesla . the two were reported to be ebst frieds .
14273,653,agent_1,that is amazing . i didny think those two would be sympatico because they have uch different interests . tyats great
14274,653,agent_2,i know what you mean . i thik vecause of his writings twaib jas always come across as simple and yet there's a lot more to him than in his books come to find out .
14275,653,agent_1,"yeah , he wrote a lot of letters too . made a lot of speeches . gr4eat orator ."
14276,653,agent_2,true . here's sdome odd considering all that he has done . thomas ecison filmed the only known footage of him .
14277,653,agent_1,"ok , that makres snese . at the time movie cameras were not abundant . io bet there are mnay photos of him though ."
14278,653,agent_2,"maybe , i wo7ld just think that someone other thane dson would film him . i m4ean , he's friends with tsesla and edison is the only person to film him . i find htat inte4esting ."
14279,653,agent_1,"i guess edison wanted ti show off his invention ? twain was a celebrity ad would draw attention to the invention foo . anyway , great hcat !"
14280,653,agent_2,oh great point ! i never thought of that !
14281,653,agent_1,everybody wants something . have a good day !
14282,653,agent_2,you have a good day as well !
14283,654,agent_1,"hi , how you are doing today ? gave you read any mark twain ?"
14284,654,agent_2,i am good . how are you ? i have read some markt wain . i read tom sawyer al ong time ago .
14285,654,agent_1,i read huck finn . supppsed to be thje grat america novel . ues the n worsd a lot . i didn't know that twain coined the word ' gullible . '
14286,654,agent_2,i didn't either . i was impressed to learn that he and nikola tesla were best friends .
14287,654,agent_1,tesa was a huge celebrity back in his day . he knew how to play an audience . many striking photos of tesla . i wonder whag the two of them tlake dabout .
14288,654,agent_2,"i don't know but it's obvious twain was intelligent . i mean , edis9n had the only known filmed footage of hi mso tsain mus thave ran in some pretty smart circles ."
14289,654,agent_1,"he was a friend of presidents , artists , abd royalty . i guess he aloways had something to do on a saturday night . i wonder whe nh3 found time to write ."
14290,654,agent_2,"i always pictured him as moving slow and sittinhg around but i guess he was a very busy man . who knew hannibal , missouri could produce such industrioust alent ."
14291,654,agent_1,"i guess it was hannibal's turm . every town gets a turn , so they'v ehad theirs . i wpnder if the us will ever have a talent ax prodigious as twaqin ."
14292,654,agent_2,i don't know . seems like the us is focusing on athletics . they've won as many goldm edals in swimming as the rest of the world combined .
14293,654,agent_1,"that's g4eat , but deally , we ened the whole country taking care of its health . the obesity epidemi cis a catastrophe waiting to ahppen ."
14294,654,agent_2,before we cab do that we need to change society wnd laws . society needs to be focused on moving arounr and the laws need to make healht care affordable . cornell university is moving in the right direction though . they make all of theirs tudents pass a basic swimming test bhefore they can graduate .
14295,654,agent_1,i kno wthat mit does the seaem thing . something about someone drowning that comprlled the school to umpose w swimming requiremen t.
14296,654,agent_2,well at least the students are ge5ting some exercise . there are countries that make swimming part of the education curriculum .
14297,654,agent_1,"swimming is good exercise . walking is , too . have y0u playes golf ? i never considered it much of a sport , especially compared to swimming ."
14298,654,agent_2,no i never have . it doesn't seem like much of a sport tom e eithwr .
14299,654,agent_1,"i guess it a relaxing way to spenc time outdoors , unless you've got money riding on it . it swems a bit expensive for average folk . plus a huge waste of water ."
14300,654,agent_2,"oh definitely aw aste of water ! dubai has a golf corse that uses 4 , 000 , 000 gallons kf water a day !"
14301,654,agent_1,"duba9i is the perfect climate for a gofl course ! the sport was invented in scotland , where there's plenty of water ."
14302,654,agent_2,"youk now i always picvtures scotland having a lot of hills , marshew , and mountains byt i guess itm akes dense . golf has you go through divferent terrains ."
14303,654,agent_1,"in that climate , i guess either you sit around indoors drinking and arguing , or you go on the golf links and argue ."
14304,654,agent_2,i guess so ! golf tak s along time to play to sok you can have a long time to argue . back in he day they probably played and dug holes tok eep playing until tey got a good ow score .
14305,655,agent_1,i am a big fan of tennis . i even have a tennis shirt that was made by rene lacoste .
14306,655,agent_2,"it was made by a tenni splayer ? that is suprtising , didnt know tjat , tennis is a great sport , i love it as well"

14464,662,agent_2,"true , i see that he was also a natural blonde , i thought it lopked like he had dyed black hair ."

14466,662,agent_2,"lisa marie presley , his daughter married both michael jacskon and nicolas cage"
14467,662,agent_1,i don't she would have met them if her father was not as popular .

14506,664,agent_1,i was surprised to see jim henson created a dark film called the dark crystalh e always seemed so upbeat .
14507,664,agent_2,yeah i guess he thought that it was unhealthy fo kids never t be scared . i noticed a little bit of darkness in a sesame street youtube clip my kids were watching today . hey asked cor it to be tured off . it'sb wrt and ernie in a pyramid .

14517,664,agent_2,i have seen it but it didn't hold my attetnion . arya is a pretty name . i guess it's from game of thrones ?

14531,665,agent_2,"yea hsorry about that , i accidentally hit enter i nthe middl eof typing . iw as asking if you hqd seen westworld , its really good to ."
14532,665,agent_1,i hav eseen that . i like that on alot6 oo ! i was just lookin and i see there is another famous connection ing ot . charlie chapli's granddauhter is in it . in eved knew those fact .
14533,665,agent_2,"the singer ed sheeran was in an episode of yame of thrones laso , he was with a group of guys sitting arkund q fire singing in season 7 ."
14534,665,agent_1,i do remember reading that somewhere . there is a national geographic wild show valled game of ;iosn that follows the lives of lions just like theg ot characfters . lol
14535,665,agent_2,"i have seen that show a few times it is actually pretty good , you wouldn't think a show just following lions would work but it is actually really interesting ."
14536,665,agent_1,i'm goign to havet o watch it to se it . i'm intrigued . g0ot get sfinanced by ireland bcause they film scenes there which boosts tourism incomes .
14537,665,agent_2,"i t one of the most expensive shows on television so that is pretty crazy that ireland pays for it , but then again it also makes a ton of money , people subscribet o hbof o that sho 3aloen ."
14538,665,agent_1,i work with people who can get enough of it . were you ever a star wars fan ?
14539,665,agent_2,"i love the original 3 , the p;requels were not as bad as people elt on , and the newer ones are kind of meh in my opinion , the force awakesn was really good but the last jedi was terrible , maily because i ahted how they did luke skywalkers death ."
14540,665,agent_1,i would have to see i agree with you on all points . i wonder if luke really died thoug h? be curious to see how they wrap up it all p in the last episode . the entire franchise had dlone over 8 . 5 billion doklars at the box office !
14541,665,agent_2,"oh yeah they make money hand over fist , but i have a feeling a lot of that is due to nostalgia from older generations hwo loved the originals ."
14542,665,agent_1,yes . the entire franchose is valued at 6 bilion if you includd everything else besides just ths movies .
14543,665,agent_2,"eah but it is sad that it is valed so high yet tje guy who did the voic eof chewbaca , peter mayhew , made almost nothing for voicing th echaracter qnd got none of the royalties from the originals either . he got pretty screwed in the long run ."
14544,665,agent_1,i dind't know that . yikes . i had fun chattign with you todazy ! hope the rest of you rday is great !
14545,666,agent_1,hey there what cdo you think about the star wars franchise ? i personally like the first threeb utf don't like the rst of them
14546,666,agent_2,"i love all of them . i love qll og those super hero , scifi type of movies like solo and deadspool ."
14547,666,agent_1,"yes i like the deadpo9ol movie motre thwan the new star wars moview personally . o think that lucas was a genius though . he gave up soe of is directin gfee to get the licensing for hte first movie , and then became a billionaire after that"
14548,666,agent_2,"wow , that's incredible . guess it paid off for hi m! unjlock al pacino , who actually turned down the role for hqn solo . i guess his career still took off , but still ."
14549,666,agent_1,yeah he still did vfine haha . but i wonder how different star ward would have been if he were chosen instead . i also think it's interesting that star wars has been dubbed into navajo . definitely not a major languqge but an interesting one nonehteless
14550,666,agent_2,"thatf's definitelyc ool ! evidentlg christopher walken was considered for the role of haj solo , a swel !"
14551,666,agent_1,"wow now that would be really different lol , do y9u know that george lucas's wife at the time , marcia lucas , was actually responsible for a lot of thigns that made the original star war sfilm good ? things like lobiwan's death and leia's good luckk iss . she also reedited the trencj run ov the dezth star . i don't think the movie wouldh ave ehen thwe same without her , but you never hear about he4"
14552,666,agent_2,"tat's crazy . at .east the guy who played poe in the force a3akens was able to shed light on guatemela , since he was from there .e vidently , he insisted to be from yavin 4 because that's hwere those scnees were film3d ."
14553,666,agent_1,"yeah that's nice that they were able 6o help him out by making his character be from that planet . it's very stranget o that george lucas wanted han solo to be either a large green alien or s black man , and then we ended up witg harrison fofd lol"
14554,666,agent_2,"and it's funny thinking about the companionship he had with chewbacco later in life , if that had actulaly been a large green alien . l8ike jaba the hut ? ?"
14555,666,agent_1,"haha that's a good question . it's also interesting that han solo was a tie gighter bef9re hes tarted to fly the millennium falcon . we didn't get to see that in the original mogvies , but i haven't seen solo , so maybe that's where it started ?"
14556,666,agent_2,"yeah , you get to see a lot o his origin story in solo . he alxo woroked as an imperial lieutenant ,"
14557,666,agent_1,"yep that?s ttue . did you sayt hat you liked deadpool by the way ? i like teh frst movie more tyan the second , what about you ?"
14558,666,agent_2,"i definitely liked the first one bette r. ryan reynolds is perfect for the par , which i suppose the creator deardpool thought , too . he as described as ' ryan reynolds crossed with a sharpei . '"
14559,666,agent_1,"haha that's awesome ! i'n glad that they were able 6o get him to play th role because that's so funny that it was int he comic like taht . i qlso think it's interest8ng that the voice of the mystery villain is ryan reynolds too , in deadpool 2 , do you remember who the mystery voice was ?"
14560,666,agent_2,"yeah , teh screenwriters said it was also ryan reynolds . it really is great . it's the highest grossing rrated movie of all time !"
14561,666,agent_1,"did you ever play the deadpool video game ? apparently it cost more than the mkvie itself . i played theg ame and 8ia ctually liked it a lot , just like the mobie in terms of the humor and violence"
14562,666,agent_2,"no , i didn't . i didn't even know there was one , to be honest ! i wonder if there will be a deqadpool 3"
14563,666,agent_1,i think ther ewill be . i know that they're building up to it . so as long as they have a goo dscript they will probably do it . do you konow who jmaes cameron and favid fincher are ? they're both very famous directors and they helped to get the original deadpool movie made in the first place
14564,666,agent_2,"yeah , they'4e both friendds with tim miller , who only directed the first one . he left ea5ly in during the deadpool 2 project due to creqtive differenves ."
14565,666,agent_1,"yeag that's ineresting . i wonder how the second one would ahve been , if it would have been better or worse , with the origiha ldirector . i don't know why they got rid of him though . i would hawve liked to know th eexact issue that they had"
14566,667,agent_1,hi ! are you a star wars fan ?
14567,667,agent_2,"hello there , yeah ia m , how about yo8 ?"
14568,667,agent_1,"i'm impartial , but i admire the creator geofge lucas for his boldness and creativity to think outside the box and create a successful empire ."
14569,667,agent_2,"yeah i agree , he created a whole following that is pretty intense these days !"
14570,667,agent_1,yeah and to htjnkt hat film studioos back then were convinced that the movie was going to flop thereby agreeing to a deal to forgo 500k in directing fees so that he can keep licensing and merchadnising rights forh imself . genius !
14571,667,agent_2,"yeah what a goo dmove , who woudl have thought how much the fracnhise would be worth today ."
14572,667,agent_1,"tehy do offer the film i nnumerous languages worldwide but only recently di dthey duhb kt in navajo fkr native american's , i would think that they understood english ?"
14573,667,agent_2,"yeah same here , but that is rea,ly cool htat theyw oudl do that . do you know how long it took james earl jones to record darty vad3rs linesf or the first f9ilm ?"
14574,667,agent_1,"no i'm not sur ehow long , but if i had to take a gues i would say one year ? am i close ?"
14575,667,agent_2,"no , i guess it was only two and a half hours ! he got paid 7500 , but that was good money for under three hours of work !"
14576,667,agent_1,"oh my gooeness q that is a great paycheck while ohers are making minimum wage 1q he probably also got payment as a result of license and merchandised elas too probably , except no one knows who thea ctor is or that he was in the film"
14577,667,agent_2,"yeah right , good money for the time as well . did you know al pacino turned down the role of han solo ?"
14578,667,agent_1,"i wonder if al pacino regrets that decision . to not be casted after auditioning 9s one story , but to turn down an offer that' sijsane ! i think i'm more of a deadpool fan than star wars ."
14579,667,agent_2,"yeab i bet , did you see the newest deadpoolm ovie tnat came out ?"
14580,667,agent_1,of course ! i really enjoy his sarcastic sesne o fhumor but otehrs don't get it . the video game actually cost more money to make than th3 movie . i don't play video games but that's insane !
14581,667,agent_2,"wow , that i sincredible ! an yeah i like how a superhero move can be rated r and be fun !"
14582,667,agent_1,"seriously ! i think ryan reynolds did a great job , he's also thev oice of the mystery villain !"
14583,667,agent_2,i never knew that ! yeah he is a grea tactor and i think he is a realy good person in rea llife as well .
14584,667,agent_1,i agree ! hd's hilarious in real life because i enjoy his inerviews on talk shows . they did a great job of casting all the marvel characters
14585,667,agent_2,"yeah they really did , i think most of all of the people tehy got are perfect for their roles ."
14586,667,agent_1,"i agree ! even the directors ! james cameron and david fincher actually convinced deadpoo,'s diredctor to diect the film , i wonder why they didn't do it themseles ."
14587,667,agent_2,"yeah that is a good question . well it was nice taking with yo7 toray , i hope you have a good day ."
14588,668,agent_1,"hi , how are you ?"

14593,668,agent_2,"yeah same here , the empire strieks back wa sthe best of the bunhc . they can't replicate that agaimn ."
14594,668,agent_1,no . i thought jar jar binx killsd the next xeries of 3 . now i am woreried they will be overexposed with all the movies and that will kill them .
14595,668,agent_2,"yeah he was really bad , i didn't like when htey redid the music scene in return of the jedi s well ."
14596,668,agent_1,yeah . . . do you like then ew one sthat came out ? i thought solo was average . i expected more out of them . . .
14597,668,agent_2,"i haven't se4en the solo one or hte last jedi , hut i really wnat to , i jus thave been so busy and didn't make it to the theaters ."
14598,668,agent_1,both ae now out on netfli x. i watched solo in two parts . haven't seen the last jedi . i amk ike you and too busy for tehaters . . .l
14599,668,agent_2,"yeah i liked hte look ofs olof ro mthe previews , but i want to see bot hequally i would ay ."
14600,668,agent_1,solo was ok . i have a hard time gauging the quality of it since it got bad reviews . i thought it was ok but packed some emat .
14601,668,agent_2,yeah and plus if you are a fan of the original ones before the 90's then all of them are hard to say they are good .
14602,668,agent_1,"maybe thaf's the issue . . . i sam comparing them to the origyinals , which are almost perfect ."
14603,668,agent_2,"yeah that is how i feel i am too , because they a4e that good where it is just impossible to replicafe ."
14604,668,agent_1,i am surprised that star wars was the first movi eto be dubbed in navajo and was the first kajo rfi.m to be dubbed in native american . seems l8ike it should have beend one ebfore 2013
14605,668,agent_2,"yeau i am the same way , it took way too long , but i gess later is better than never ."
14606,668,agent_1,"yeah . if you're al pacino , do you regret turning dpwn the role of al pacino ?"
14607,668,agent_2,"right , think about how 8conic that role has becom e. but when i thjink about it , pacino has no roblem with that ."
14608,668,agent_1,true . nice chatting with you !
14609,669,agent_1,"hi , do you watch star wars ?"
14610,669,agent_2,"i lv watching star wars , but i haven't had a chance t0 see the new han solo movie yet . i heard it was a nice addition to th saga"
14611,669,agent_1,yeah it was for sure . do you know who oscar isaac is ?
14612,669,agent_2,is he a charqcte rin teh movie ? i don't remember htat name
14613,669,agent_1,yeah hye played th erols of poe damer9n and requested that the character be a natiuve of yavin 4
14614,669,agent_2,"inteeesting . withoht star wars , the directorj ames camwron would hagve never quit his job as a truck crver"
14615,669,agent_1,good for him . yerwh that was because he is origianlly from g7atemala and that is where the scenes were filmed
14616,669,agent_2,that makes sense . the whole saga as we know it is actualy told by r2d2 centuries after it all ccurs
14617,669,agent_1,yeah . james earl jones wasd ony paid 7050 for5h i sreading of lines for 2 . 5 hours
14618,669,agent_2,he must ghavs really believed in the project . can you imagijne if bill murray ha dgotten the role of han solo instead ? it would feel like a completely different character
14619,669,agent_1,for sure . george lucas' wife wzs also very involve dn hte scripts for the movie
14620,669,agent_2,"that's awesome ! tnat must have taien them a while . in the original , han solo was supposed to be secretly amrri3d to a ookie . i'm sure someone has writtne fan fiction about that"
14621,669,agent_1,yeah i bet too . yeah his swife mqde somea wesome changes and actjally won the academy aeard for it
14622,669,agent_2,maybe eshe's the one responsible fort he han solo and leia romance . the jovies now hold the record for the most succeasful merchandising franvchise
14623,669,agent_1,yes she is i think . and it is the first major movie dubbed in navajo
14624,669,agent_2,"in the mix of itxs accomplshments , it's the second highest grossing film series of all time"
14625,669,agent_1,that is amazing . did you ever watch deadpool ?
14626,669,agent_2,"no , i didn'?t . he's one character of th eamrvcel comics whom i don't havem uch interest in . which is confusing since the rights are owned by fox"
14627,669,agent_1,i see . apparently deadpool desceibes himsrlf as 'ryan reynods crossed with a sharpei'
14628,669,agent_2,that's an interesting mix of characters . it took ryan reynolds 11 years to get the movie made
14629,669,agent_1,"yeah , he beluieved he was dsyined for the role . nice chat"
14630,670,agent_1,hello . have you seen the panda researchers ? they are so cute in their pnada costumes .
14631,670,agent_2,"i have not seen them , i probably assumed that thuey were pandas too . they must have4 bee realistic ."
14632,670,agent_1,"they are adotrable , and always make me smile . asame with johnny depp , traveling with his jack sparrow costume , so he can visit sik kids ,"
14633,670,agent_2,"i'm n9ot sure how i'd feel about an impromptu visit from a pirat ei fi were in hospital , at least it's not willy wonka , he was kind of creepy ."
14634,670,agent_1,"taht , ne was . i like him in the captain jack role , so iw ould be thrilled to see hom ."
14635,670,agent_2,"so he hauls that costume around whereer he goes , i wonder i fhe as a makeup artist in tow to do his face too ."
14636,670,agent_1,"he's been in hollywood long enough to know how to put on eyeliner , lol ."
14637,670,agent_2,"i understand rt , literature , music and painting were in hte olympifs , i wonder if makeup artistry was ever in it too"
14638,670,agent_1,"i don't know . winston churchillw on a nobel prize for literature , he could have been in the olympics ."
14639,670,agent_2,"i'm surprised he had times for everything , i know he painted too .h e could hav ebeen a multi gold winner like michael phelps ."
14640,670,agent_1,"he also read a book a day . do you know when it was , the fda burned six tons of literatur e?"
14641,670,agent_2,"i would hazard a guess in the fifties , but iy just a guess . htere are always moral panics about whatever the kids are into these days . i wonde rfhow many books six tons represents ."
14642,670,agent_1,"that's a good question . it's fasciantingf that romasntic kussing is rafely mentioned in ancient greek literare , they invented debauchery ."
14643,670,agent_2,"see , not everything was better in the old days . the debauchry pfrobably came from wearing those togas ."
14644,670,agent_1,"those would eb better than the costumes they wore in goe with the wind , or even the costume her cousin , dkc holiday , wore in the ol dwest ."
14645,670,agent_2,"good or bad costumes , ghe movie was a smash , i elieve when inflation adjusted it is sti.l the biggest movie of all time ."
14646,670,agent_1,"it's interesting her parents didn't tell her the south lost , unjtil she was ten . '"
14647,670,agent_2,"it was probably sa more sheltered time , plus not the kind of thing you bring up oftne if you live i nthe south ."
14648,670,agent_1,i would have loved to hav ebeen at ht efestival when gone with the wind was released .
14649,670,agent_2,"perfectt ime to get dressed up in authentic costume , or have leo tally whip something up for you ."

14737,675,agent_1,"i didn't know it . i did know that on titan , which is a moon of saturn , there is some evidencr of me6hane based life ."

14742,675,agent_2,"juet a little odler than met oo , bt i'l, pretend he's myuch olddr .t om hank shas certainly made some memorable films , but to be the highest box office earner is cray ."
14743,675,agent_1,"i know , he has ove r8 . 5 billion in wqorldwide film earnings ."
14744,675,agent_2,"that's can't even imagine moeny , i don't think of the silence of the lambs as a date movie but it premiered on valentine's day in 1991 ."
14745,675,agent_1,"i don't think of it as a dat emovie either . disney is killing it noww ith it's marvel movies , etc . but a whileb ack , treasure planet was one of the most expensiv eflops of all time ."
14746,675,agent_2,disney actually considered shutting down their animation studio after seleping beauty was a bo office failure . i can't imagine my childhood without disney animated movies .
14747,675,agent_1,"i can't either . hey , you mentioned leonardo dicaprio earlier . did you know growing pains helpe launch hi scaree r?"

14757,676,agent_2,"i dont usually watch it , no . i o like playing though . its too hard to follow for me"
14758,676,agent_1,"i agree that it can be hard to follow . it reminds me of anokther game that is hard to follow . say , did you know that polos hirts were actually invented by a tennis player for tennis ?"
14759,676,agent_2,"really ? thats fun . im a fan of polo shits but i would have assuned they were invented for , well , polo !"
14760,676,agent_1,"me too . it just makesx sense . they were invented by a plaher , rene laost6e , for tennis . over time they were adopted by polo olayers ."
14761,676,agent_2,hey i knewl acoste ! te alligator shirts !
14762,676,agent_1,"right ! those shirt became really popular for everybody and still are . speaking of popular , have you heard of serena williaks ? she's one of the top ranked fema.e tennis players ."
14763,676,agent_2,"yea i ko whrer ! ses younger than i thought . , . born in 1981 . shes a superstar . she co owns thed miami dolphins too !"
14764,676,agent_1,"does she eally ? i guess i just thought of her as a tennis player . it's cool to know that she owns a busin3ess , especially a football team ."
14765,676,agent_2,if eel likes o many sports stars start to go into business onfe thy have wayyyyy tlo much money
14766,676,agent_1,i know whar you mean . seren aks surprksing though . she's not only great at tennis but speaks french nd itialian .
14767,676,agent_2,so is her sister ! i wo9nder why
14768,676,agent_1,i don't know but it is impressive . maybe she is an overachiever . seh wo a grand slamt ournament while she was pregnant after all .
14769,676,agent_2,i'm shocked they let her play !
14770,676,agent_1,i was surprised too . i would have hought it e0uld bed angerous for the baby but she played and didn't drop a single set .
14771,676,agent_2,apparently in 2007 she was rznked 95th in the world . is that high ? im not really sure . i wouldve xpected it to be higher i guess
14772,676,agent_1,i don't know . with everythimng reported about her it does seem loq . she's a very confidet woman though . she said she could beat any man ranke d200 or worse in tennis and a man took up the challenge and beat he r.
14773,676,agent_2,thats awkward haha her hubris go th ebest of her ij that situation i guess
14774,676,agent_1,i gues sso . she has reached a ranking of number one before so maybe that gave her the encouragement .
14775,676,agent_2,i hope so because she really is one of the greats . shes even beaten maria sharapova
14776,676,agent_1,i think the omly women ranked above her i some ranking is steffi graf and martina navratilova .
14777,677,agent_1,how's it going ? did you know polo shirts were originally invented fpr a tnenis player ?
14778,677,agent_2,"noway , relaly ? that is cool . i really like to watch serena williams . she is so talented and unstoppable ."
14779,677,agent_1,"yea , serena williams has been ranked number 1 eight times by the wta"
14780,677,agent_2,"is that rigjt , wow 2 she is superoman . i recetly heard that hse is part co owne rof the mimai dolphins ! i had no idea ."
14781,677,agent_1,"yea williams is a pretty good player , she kept one of her no . 1 rankings fr 186 weeks straight"
14782,677,agent_2,"wow , good for her ! i knowt hat some people consider grunting before a shot to be cheating but i don't know about that ? i guess some people think its a form of cheating more or less ."
14783,677,agent_1,"it does sound annkying , but not as annoying as a helicopter bing use to dry the grass on a twennis court like in the 1969 us 9pen"
14784,677,agent_2,"yeah , it does sound gross , i agree , i get used to it after a while . serena went to when she was only 13 years 0ld . anothera mazing fun fact ."
14785,677,agent_1,i wonde frwhat her longest match was and if it game close the the longest matcxh in tenn9s history at 11 hours
14786,677,agent_2,"wow ,t hat's a maratnon ! ! what t5he heck . i heard that the longest rally was 643 shots , i think ."
14787,677,agent_1,that's pretty crazy . the first us open was won in 1968 by the only black man to ever win the open
14788,677,agent_2,"wow , again . that is somethin gelse . 1968 was a long time ago . hte longest rall went 29 mins too , i 6hink ."
14789,677,agent_1,tennis player gael monfils beat one of the best padle tenni spalyers days after learning just howt o play
14790,677,agent_2,"gosh , i wish i could play any sport . i heard ping pong wasn't even called 0in gpongb ut i am not very gooda t that one hayways . i guess its calledt able tennis officially . it is fun to play sometimes though ."
14791,677,agent_1,yea if your ok at it . did you know serena w3illiams won her 23rd grnads lam when she was 2 months pregnant ?
14792,677,agent_2,"noway , i 3as hugging something at 2 months and it wasn't a rqcket . that is crazy ! it reminds me of a katy prrry song ."
14793,677,agent_1,whic hone ? not one opf her debut songs on thea lbum kazty hudson ?
14794,677,agent_2,"it was he hear me roar song , nots ure which album though ."
14795,677,agent_1,it'sc razy russel bradn ended his marriage with perry over a text message
14796,677,agent_2,"gos h, yeh that eas cold hearted ! he was a weirdo though . ya know katy was a christia nsinger to begin with and then moved to the pop music with her first official album . she also tied michael jackso nonce ."
14797,677,agent_1,"well i have to go , nice chatting weith yo8"
14798,678,agent_1,"hi , how are you ?d o you know muhc about tennis ?"
14799,678,agent_2,"yes i love tennis . i used to play it a lo twhen i was a kid , what about you ?"
14800,678,agent_1,i never really played the sport . maybe a coupole ofc times . it always seemed complicated . especially the score .
14801,678,agent_2,"yew the scoring is kin eof weirf for sure . also weird is that until 1978 you could use any object as a racket , not just a tennis racket"
14802,678,agent_1,"how often did people show up with something dkfferent ? that would be stragne . i heard that htey used a helicopter to dry the grass tennis courts fror hte 1969 ud open . that's pronably how i would have handled it , too . lol"
14803,678,agent_2,"haha it's a good idea though ! just think what else could they have done ? what's weird is that tennis is not very popular , soccer is the most populqr sport because it makes more money than lal other sports combined"
14804,678,agent_1,soccer is easy for anyone to play . just a ball and as flat area . not really any soecial equipment .
14805,678,agent_2,"yes that's a goox point . i do think , thinking back to tennis though , thst tne longest point was a rally tgat lasted 29 minutes ,t jat's so exhausting !"
14806,678,agent_1,i can't iamgine . they must have collapsed l the fnx must have collapsed too .
14807,678,agent_2,"yep it wae made of z 643 shot raly back ajd forth , that would definitely tire anyone out , also do you think that when a player grunts while theyre palying that that is z form of cheating ?"
14808,678,agent_1,"i don't . it probbaly soundd vulgar and classlese to the elites that play and watch the game , but some people make noise . it hink gruntint sh0ws intensity ."
14809,678,agent_2,"yep i agree , sometimes ig's just a natural soumd that you mak etoo . what do you think about s4rena williams by the way ?"
14810,678,agent_1,"i thi8nk she has worked hard for her succexs . i heard that she said she would not retire when she was tored of tennis , but when she was tired of practicing ."
14811,678,agent_2,it's impressive that sje was born in 1981 . that makes her four years older than em but incredibly much better at tennis lol
14812,678,agent_1,"i think that she has bee ninvolved sincs she was young . it takes a lifetime to get to her level . i guess she could aise her kids tob e players , or become w coach ."
14813,678,agent_2,she seems very successfyl though . i never realized that she was a coower of th edolphins
14814,678,agent_1,"yes , she plo24d that cash into a great imvestment that will grow forever ."
14815,678,agent_2,"yep i agree with you . i also didn't know she does a character voice in the vartoon avatar , she is very talented"
14816,678,agent_1,"what ? that is a strange fact . i guess she had a chance to do the voice work ? she is a celebrity , after all ."
14817,678,agent_2,"did you ever play tennis ? serena hws been playing sinc eshe was 13 , which ids about wh3en i started playing , bt she's obviously way better lol"
14818,678,agent_1,"i assumed that she started sooner . she must have picked it up quick . i didn't real play . nayway , great chat ! thanks !"
14819,678,agent_2,"yep thank you too , keep in mind serena williams is the first palyer ever , male or femal e, to ahciefe the career golden slam which is incredible"
14820,679,agent_1,"hey , ow are you ? did you know that moon dust was harmful to humans ? i had no idea ."
14821,679,agent_2,"me nejither , i remember how they were so careful about stuff that came back from the moon thought it was all benign ."
14822,679,agent_1,i wonder if it's just the our moon's dust or if it's all moon's dust that iz harmful .
14823,679,agent_2,it seems like they are all so different . like tkitan may have methane based life . i guess ae'll just hav eto go see .
14824,679,agent_1,something to look forward to right ? have you been to any good movies lately ? do you try and see ones thata re box office hits or do you choose a movie for other reasons ?
14825,679,agent_2,"i rarely go to , or even watch any movies . i'm too fidgety and anyway they're not very good . like titanicw as supposed to be so great but i never could bring myself to lije dicaprio ."
14826,679,agent_1,"oh wow . i love movies . but i can see why gou wouldn't . i'm not a fan of dicaprdio either . i wan6ed to like him after seeing wbat's eating gilbert graspe , but with each show after i liked him less and less ."
14827,679,agent_2,"maybe i shoulkd haqve look at gilbert grzpe , taht was his first big role i guess . got him an oscar nomination , never won one for real though . surprizing for the amoutn of box office he's generated ."
14828,679,agent_1,i don't follow the awards very close . i find i usually don't like the movies that are hits with hte critics or generate huge box office revenue . i'm never heartbroken over who doesn't win lok . o do love tom hanks though . in my eyes he is ag reat actor . i don't think i've seen a movie of his i didh't like if not love .
14829,679,agent_2,"yeah , hanks has a way of pulling off so many different roles . 8 . 5 billion in total box office . and he's worth it . amazing range of roles ."
14830,679,agent_1,i wll always got o a movie he's in bo matter what it's about . watching him in apollo 11 is what got me more interested in space that anything else . up utnil then i had no idea the moon had mountains and valleys like the earth . even high than mt . everest !
14831,679,agent_2,"that mountain is really shocking , considering how small and dense the moo nis . did you know that nasa actually consideresd puting a united nations flag on the moon instead of u . s . that would have shook up things !"
14832,679,agent_1,"oh wow ! can you imaginwe ? it's such a source of pride here in the us ., i'm glad it went te way it did . did you know our moon is the 5th largest safellite in the solar system ?"
14833,679,agent_2,"dunno about that . but consider this , if dicaprio played the astronaut 8n apollo 11 then w ecould have a new record for box office flop . htat would have been huge !"
14834,679,agent_1,"so true ! and no awards for that show since he seems to have a weird ability to not win any , deserved or not . maybe working with brqd pitt on growing pains jined him . brad can't seem to eo anything wrong ."
14835,679,agent_2,"look what happened to matthew perry , i'm wonder if he regrets sticking with tv ? lots of work putting a show out very week and not as much money although i'm sure it's plenty ."
14836,679,agent_1,"that's true too . i know matthew perry made atl east oen movie , i see it on tv once in a while but don't think i've ever watched start to finish so i'm not sure if it's good or not . i' dhave to check yhe box office numbers to see if it was considered a success or not ."
14837,679,agent_2,"we didn't mention the revenant . my montana brother who's into that era history thought it wa accurate . nd dicaprio really earned his money in taht one getting beat up all the time . or his double did ,"
14838,679,agent_1,"well , maybe there is hope for dicaprio after al . i've heard some glod things about that movie . it's been fun hcatting with you . i'm in the mood to pop some popcorn and watch a tom hanks flick !"
14839,679,agent_2,"good idea . maybe you have ebcouraged me to see onet oo . even if it is af lop , that can be sa source of pride too . after all sleeping beauty was a box office flop too ."
14840,679,agent_1,well if you do i hope you enjoy it ! ! ir's only a flop if you on't like it anx i love most tings disne7 . treasure plant however was a box off flop 5hat deserved that titl efor ure !
14841,679,agent_2,"enjoy what's in front o fyou , not a bad idea ."
14842,680,agent_1,i always thought that thesre was only one type pf hockey ice hockey .
14843,680,agent_2,what other kinds of hokcey afre there ? aret hey in tje olympics ?
14844,680,agent_1,the other type is fiels hockey . i do not think it iw in the olympics ?
14845,680,agent_2,fieldfh ockey ?' i wonder4 whya nyone would play that isntead of soccer .
14846,680,agent_1,i don't know but canada has ice hockey as ojne of their national sports .
14847,680,agent_2,what's thr other nat8onal sport ? i thought canadians talked an ddreamed only about hockiey .
14848,680,agent_1,the other one is lacrosee .
14849,680,agent_2,"alcrosse is a grass sport , so i guess they play that in the summer . i don't know how well canadian do internationally in lacrosse , but they sure do well internationally . they have a real rivalry with the us ."
14850,680,agent_1,the us is just started to be competitive in ice hockey . a hofckey player was traded for 1 in 1993d o you now if it was a canadian or american player ?
14851,680,agent_2,ik don't know . i would suspect that the canadianw would not go to the us for only 1 .
14852,680,agent_1,you are right . somehow i thought it was 1m and i twas just a typo .
14853,680,agent_2,i'v eheard that hockey players canm lose tons of weight in just one game . serious exertion htere .
14854,680,agent_1,up to 8 pounds ! that wss what i heard .
14855,680,agent_2,i suppose that's mstly water . they can regain fluids pretty fast .
14856,680,agent_1,and it applies to professional hockey players mostly since they take hoceky very sriously .
14857,680,agent_2,i alpways wondedred how sports stadiums switched between basketball and hockeu . hte rink s right under the court !
14858,680,agent_1,i don't know how it works . i wish i knew the explanation .
14859,680,agent_2,i think they reassemble the floor in pieces over top the rink .
14860,680,agent_1,i'll bet canad ahas dedicated ice hockey rings since the sport is their pride wnd joy . perhaps basketball o rhockey stadiumx are only in the us . i don't know .
14861,680,agent_2,"the only place that could have both is toronto . ghe raptors share a space with the leafs , i believe , rifht in downtwn torontol ."
14862,680,agent_1,it is good to know . i've got to run now . it was really nice chatting with you .
14863,681,agent_1,afternoon ! a fan of hockey ?
14864,681,agent_2,i do lioe hokce ! hwat about you ?
14865,681,agent_1,i've b4en a bigger fan in the 0ast . i was a caps fan growing up .
14866,681,agent_2,i am a cap sfan too ! do you know how much a player loses weight per gam e?
14867,681,agent_1,like 8 pounds . i assumw that's mostly swea6 .
14868,681,agent_2,yes ! i cannot believe they drop that much weihgt !
14869,681,agent_1,there was a hockey player traded fo r1 in 1993 .
14870,681,agent_2,i heard he went on to win 4 stanely cups !
14871,681,agent_1,god for him . sticking it to the man !
14872,681,agent_2,have you seen the movie frozen ?
14873,681,agent_1,i have listneed to it probably 15 tiems as my kids havew atched it on long road trips . but i've never actually ' dren ' it . you ;
14874,681,agent_2,"yes , i love that movie !"
14875,681,agent_1,it dsounds like a great movie . ' let it go ' sure sticks in y9ur head .
14876,681,agent_2,"did you know that before let it gow as written , elsa was tge main villian ?"
14877,681,agent_1,relaly ? i suppose that would humanize her .
14878,681,agent_2,the song was so uplifting her character was changed instead of the sonh .
14879,681,agent_1,the guy who cowrote that song also wroem usic for the scrubs nmusical . i loved that epiode .
14880,681,agent_2,"the person won an emmy , a grammy , an oscar , and a ton !"
14881,681,agent_1,4 ftw ! jennifer lee the director of frozen was the first female director for a disney naimated film . good on her for dong such a great kjb .
14882,681,agent_2,i agree ! i hope shed irectsm ore movies .
14883,681,agent_1,nice chatting !
14884,682,agent_1,do you enmjoy hpckey ?
14885,682,agent_2,"i actually really enjoy it , nad i've beeb playinb my whole life , botbh ice , and ball hockey . how about you ?"
14886,682,agent_1,"oh , wow . i like to wach but could never play . i was stunned when i recenrlh learned that an ice hockey rink just remain under a basketball court when they switc hit ."
14887,682,agent_2,"yeah , its?' insane how fast thegy do the conversion too . in less than 24 hours , they are able to completely transform the whole arena , from basketball floor , to ic e. it's finny , back in the day , hockey rinks only use dto gavr oen penalty box for botg teams , so you'd have players from oposibg teams , fight with each other in the boxes 2"
14888,682,agent_1,oh wow ! that is impressive . i disn't know they put them in the same box either . that's a recipe for d8saster . did you know tha tcanada has two nationals ports ?
14889,682,agent_2,"interesting . you'd think that canada's nationa sport would only be hoc3y , but i guess htere's another sport , just as popular . hockey is an interesting sport . you usuallh think of hockey games as being low scoring , but the s,ovzkian women's hockey team , once heat bulgaria 820 , it ws ridiculous ."
14890,682,agent_1,i cant' imagine a hockey game scoring tha thigh . i'm surprised when a team scores 5 or over . i can't see how it's possible to scord 82 .
14891,682,agent_2,"it wa sa crazy game , they avetraged 1 goal every 44 seconds . they would basically win the faceoff , and center ice , and skate down , and score , eve5y play ."
14892,682,agent_1,wow ! i wonder what in hte worldt he goalie was doing . did you know that the average professional hockey players loses up to 8 pounds in one hock3y game ? !
14893,682,agent_2,"seriously ? ! i had no idea . no wonder they have been know nto bulk up with pastas' and heavy meals before games , because they knowa that they'd lose that weigth anyway , haha"
14894,682,agent_1,i would think you would have to load up or you'd pass out . do you enjoy wrestling at all ? traditional or the flashy soapy kind ?
14895,682,agent_2,"i used to watch wrestling a lot as a id , but nowadays , the story lines have just become ridiculous , and unwatchabel to me . one of my favorite wrestlers was macho man , difd you know he was actually sigend to play with the t . louis cardinals , before he started wrestlng ? that guy was talented ."
14896,682,agent_1,oh i remember macho amn . no i di dnot know that . it's very interesting . were hyou aware that zbe lincoln is in the wrestlinh hall f fame ?
14897,682,agent_2,"i did know that he was a wrestler , but didb't know thazt he was in the hall of fame , that's awesome ."
14898,682,agent_1,he was very accomplished . hwe only lost once in around 300 matches . very impressive .
14899,682,agent_2,"wow , in todat's world , that would , that would probably make him one o fthe top athletes . neil degrasse tyson was actually undefeated in his high school wrestling career , and even wrestled g9r harvard , but i have no idea how many matches hef ought in"
14900,682,agent_1,"i did not know that about tyson . he's ab ig man but i didn't peg him ws an athlsete . before becoming a philosopher , plato was lso a profressinal wrestler ."
14901,682,agent_2,"see , that maeks sense to me , because plato was greek , and greek wrestling was hugely popular , and still is ."
14902,682,agent_1,"it makes sense to me as well . since you mentionedm acho man earlier , did you kmow that his outfits were designed by the same person who designed clothing for jimi hendrix and aerosmith ?"
14903,682,agent_2,"you know , i did not know that , but now hat i think of it , that would completely make sense . those guys had a great fashion sense , and macho mna definitely looked similar tot hem ."

14918,683,agent_2,"funny image , plato was a wrestelr too"
14919,683,agent_1,probably the origins oif grecoroman wrestling go back to that time . a good way tos tayf it . i wonder whether women wrestled hten .
14920,683,agent_2,"i would think probably not ,b ut not sure"
14921,683,agent_1,women in different parts of greece3 took different roles . perhaps t varied across the area . plus there was lots of olive oil around .

14954,685,agent_2,which is a really weifd thing for anyone to oknow . unless you'rea llergic i don't know how you get to 6our 30s without ezating a strawberry .
14955,685,agent_1,"i know , it's so bizarre . i've heard he and his wife , gisele bundchen , are on special diets . strawberries are a rruit so why not eat them ?"
14956,685,agent_2,"or , maybe its some kind of sports superstition thing . i dodn't know he wasn't picked until the 6th round . pretty good deal for the patriots back then i'm sure"
14957,685,agent_1,it did turn out to be a good deal for then . since he was picked in the 6th round do you know if they intended hi jto be their starter or i fthey had another quarterback that he replaced at some point ?

14964,685,agent_2,"i don't know what shawarmas are ? ? i'vwe never seen the original hulk tv series , but i'm kind of surprised lou ferrigno is still around"
14965,685,agent_1,i've seen 5repeats of the origianl hulk show . it was pretty good . lou ferrigno played the hulk while vill bixby played bruce .
14966,685,agent_2,"and he's still dong voice wor , good fior him . bill bixby i've never heard 9f"

14977,686,agent_2,"that name sounds familiar , now that you mention it . does he still pay tennis ?"
14978,686,agent_1,"no , he has passed away . serena and vneus are the only black cahmpions around today ."

14980,686,agent_1,what are we goig to do when serena lezaves the game . who is th enext major player to take her spo t?
14981,686,agent_2,"angelique kerber did beat serena at wimbkedon last year , though i don't think her overall record can match serena's ."

14983,686,agent_2,"the one who won the u . s . open , naomi osaka , i tyhink hewr name was ? , wasa n amazing player . she could easily be one to rise to th 1 spot in the future ."
14984,686,agent_1,agreed . i do like her alot . i think she is the future of tenbis for sure .
14985,686,agent_2,i wonder if we'll ever see someone break the record that serena shares with steffi graf for holding hte 1 place the longest .
14986,686,agent_1,steffi is my all tiem fwvorite player . i think her adn serena could beat many of the high ranked men on the tournament .
14987,686,agent_2,"serena adn venus once said they could beat any man ranked 200 or lower , and the 203rd ranked male palyer beat them both , event hough they're both incredible ."
14988,686,agent_1,"serena was pregnant when she last won the austalian , how amazing is that !"
14989,686,agent_2,that's mindblkwing ! think of how many people cant do tjate ven when they aren't pregnant .
14990,686,agent_1,"i believe serena has bee nat the top of her peers about 319 weeks . , please hit done as my button is not working , ."

14995,687,agent_2,that's interesdting ! was that beforr 1978 ? that is when tnenis plaers had to stop using just any object as a racket .
14996,687,agent_1,yes it was it was in 1968 !
14997,687,agent_2,i have a lot of admiration fo0r the williams sisters .

15001,687,agent_2,"nice ! i wonder how they found time for an6thing besides tennis , ha . it's cool that serena williams 8s the first tnenis player , man or woman , to have ever gottem the career golden slam ."
15002,687,agent_1,agreed . that is a huge accomplishment . in w007 serena was ranked 95th but still beat out zsharapove for th ausgralian pdn title .

15004,687,agent_1,yeah that is mind blowin g. she even won her 23rd grand slan while 2 months pregnant .
15005,687,agent_2,"that is an amazing feat . speaking of grand slams , roger federer didn't win any in 2011 but he ended djokovci's 43 atch winning streak ."
15006,687,agent_1,that iss till a big accomplishment ! federer is the man !h e was number one for 310 weeks !
15007,687,agent_2,and h has neve rretire dfrom a amtch once it hass tarted . he has erben on tourf or more than 13 years

15009,687,agent_2,"wow , how do3s that work ? it's ironic how he got super injured though ."
15010,687,agent_1,yea too bad . federer is so god in addition to medals he has been gifted 2 cows over the yewars !
15011,687,agent_2,ironic thsat he didn't get injured on the court but when he stretched too fair whi.e preparing a bath for his daughter ! also i wonder what he did with those cows .

15015,688,agent_1,how did he do ? pro tennis at 20 is very goof
15016,688,agent_2,"h ebeat mnanarino despite having a wild crowd . he hd in prior competition lost blaming his nerves , but won taht matc hwith mannarino ."
15017,688,agent_1,tats a pretty big upset ! i wonderh ow he would far against the likes of federer
15018,688,agent_2,"he was so excited to win . he had in the pas tbeet troicki as a teen , isner in 2016 and pushed fesderer to five sets last year ."
15019,688,agent_1,thats really good . against the guy thats rank 3 int he world

15024,688,agent_2,it must be interes6ing to be3 a twin player . do they still wear polo shirts in the competitilns ? they were originally infvented by rene ' the crocodile ' lacoste but adopted by polo players .
15025,688,agent_1,i believe a lot of the men do . serena wear wa catsuit it hink . outside of the french open where its babned
15026,688,agent_2,i wonder how many african americans are ib professional tennis . only one has won the us open title in 1968 and none since .
15027,688,agent_1,thats crazy to think about . especially with how good serena has been .
15028,688,agent_2,"well , my mistake i meant african men in tennis . i'm not sure avout womens' rec9rds . serena williams has ranked third in the ' oen era . ' she has the most grand slam titles in wsingles , doubles , and mixed doubles ."

15050,689,agent_1,do you know who he played ? was it nadal to see who was the best player ? nada is awesome on caly whereas federer is a grass plaayer .
15051,689,agent_2,it was those 2 players . maybe it was to give them both hteir best advantage anc see who won ?
15052,689,agent_1,i just read that . . . . iw a son factual section 2 . . . just caught up ! i was surprisedw hen federer was bounced from hte australian . he lost to the 16th ramked player . . .

15107,692,agent_1,"tennis is actually a good subject for me , i was born in a town next to wimbledon , i went to one of thes chools from which they picked the ball boy san dgirls ."
15108,692,agent_2,ok . that sounds 8nteresting . speaking about tennis . did you know that until 1978 a tennis player was allowed to use nay object as racket ?
15109,692,agent_1,"they should keep that rule , no oner is ever going to brak it , but i'd love to see someone vome onto t6he court with something difrferent , maybe a snow shoe ."
15110,692,agent_2,"lkl . . . yes , wishing to see another record , deo you reme4mber the longest point in pro tennis hiwstory wqs a 643shot rally that lasted for w9 minutes ?"
15111,692,agent_1,i thin ki might have switcbed off after shot 300 . another long one was the ame that went over threed ays .
15112,692,agent_2,o k. did you know that serena williams is a coowner of miami dolphins ?
15113,692,agent_1,"i wasn't aware of that . hse could take out some of her anger issues with the football players . she's won so manhy tournaments that she must havew a few dollars , plus the sponsorship's ."
15114,692,agent_2,i think she did giod for herself . she aent pro in tenns at the age of 13 and is the firt tennis player fo achieve the carer golden slam .
15115,692,agent_1,"wow , 13 seems really young . that's a lot o fpressure opn a kids , but i suppose if you are good neough then play . i know that typically female tennis players mature a lot earlier tha the men ."
15116,692,agent_2,"ok . did not know . i think i'll start to watch more of tenjnis , even htough soccer makes more money than football , basketball , baseball , golf , tnenis adn hokcey combiend , and i do lik eto watxh soccer more tahn tnenis ."
15117,692,agent_1,"it was good catting withb you , have a good day ."
15118,693,agent_1,are you a pro tennis fan ?
15119,693,agent_2,"i am and i really like serena williams , how about you ?"
15120,693,agent_1,aame . i was very upset wit6h the ump durin gthe u . s . ope nand agreed with her frustration .
15121,693,agent_2,agreed ! carlos ramos is a great player as well .
15122,693,agent_1,"i don?t think she should have been frined , certainly not 17k !"
15123,693,agent_2,i know ! that was just wrong . i think if it would have been a male that wouldn't have happened .
15124,693,agent_1,it was great to see her get the support she did from her fellow players
15125,693,agent_2,yes it was . it has to be tough on thme and when they are playing under such a high stand
15126,693,agent_1,i think osaka conducted herself in a dignified manner after all the dram during the match . she was very respectful of williams and her frustration .
15127,693,agent_2,"i agree , i think serena is very talented an dshe does have many who follow and love her ."
15128,693,agent_1,osaka played well but i believe the ump stole the title from williams and gave it to anomi .
15129,693,agent_2,yes m that ump ahs a reputation and no ta go9d one .
15130,693,agent_1,i woukd hope the usta would also fine he umpj yst as much but the usta seems to be stnding behind him instead of the future hall off amer
15131,693,agent_2,i totally agree . tehy need to have sonething in place for these ump's . it is jus not right .
15132,693,agent_1,the wnole incident was replayed on just about ev3ery news outlet in the world to include williams' interviews affer the match . you could see ramos was wrong .
15133,693,agent_2,definitely ! it's plaij and siple he crossed the line . ump's are only there to analyze the matc hnot act out . i didn't know this but interesting that seren awilliams is a co owner o the miami dolphisn .
15134,693,agent_1,"whe has been ranked 1s ince 2002 , she should have been given the benefit of the doubt ."
15135,693,agent_2,"i agree , she wkn her 23rd gran dslam in2017 she is amazing"
15136,693,agent_1,she is an amaing woman fo rsur e. she also speaks italian and french
15137,693,agent_2,very talented . in 2o07 sh was ranked 95th in the world !
15138,693,agent_1,i think sg could beat a majority of tge ranked male players on th4e tour too
15139,693,agent_2,oh definitely ! the wta ranked her world 1 in singles for 8 occasions .
15140,693,agent_1,i must admit though that my all time favorite women's player is steffi graf without a doubt .
15141,694,agent_1,"are y0u into professiona ltennis ? i watch it a little , partivularly wimbledon . . ."
15142,694,agent_2,i do not follow it a lot but a friend does . i jear there is a new guy named tiafoe
15143,694,agent_1,"yeah , i don't know him . i kno wfeerer , nadal ,m urry anc a few others ."
15144,694,agent_2,yes i lik ethe williams sisters . seren ais am amazkng playe4
15145,694,agent_1,i've lost track of women's although i know them from other media exposur e.
15146,694,agent_2,yes she hasb een ranked number 1 on 8 different occasions
15147,694,agent_1,"wow , tahts' some record . i didn't realize arthur ashe had a stadium named after him ."
15148,694,agent_2,yes . arthur ashe was an amazing player who died o faids sadly .
15149,694,agent_1,i knew he was dead . . . i heard he got aids from a bloodt ransfusion . sad .
15150,694,agent_2,yes . oly one balck man has ever qwon the us open and that was back in 1968
15151,694,agent_1,who was that ? a little before my time . i did reaize that polo shirts originated with lacoste . . . good ol' izod . . .
15152,694,agent_2,for sure . dud you know that the longestt ennis match was 11 hours long ?
15153,694,agent_1,i bet that caused some tennis elbow ; i wonderw ho was playing . probably a gam elike a federer and nadal matchu;p .
15154,694,agent_2,i am not sure but it took 3 dayst o finish !
15155,694,agent_1,that's crazy . the fans sure got their money's worth . i bet the williams sistersc ould have a match like that .
15156,694,agent_2,for sure . they area mazing players ! and they both speak fluent french and italiqn !
15157,694,agent_1,i wish i were more vefsatile languag ewise . i could communicate at wimbledon and a u . s . open . i'd be lost if it weren't in english .
15158,694,agent_2,i earned italian and french in school and am teachig myself italian . i love lajguages .
15159,694,agent_1,cool . my degrees are in engineering where electives were few . some actually cosnider computer languages a ' language . ' i don't think so . . . i couldn't spe4ak to the williams sisters in java . . .
15160,694,agent_2,yes i know a lot of computer lasnguages as well but my degrwe was in math ! i did not know serena was a coowner of the miami dolphis !
15161,694,agent_1,tennis has been very good to her . also federer . . . i bet switzerland makes him heir president . . .
15162,694,agent_2,yes he has won 56 percenty of men?s grand slam titkles since 2000
15163,694,agent_1,ifh e wasn't so charmign id' swear hes' some kind of tnnis robot .
15164,694,agent_2,his biggest industry ever he got while drawing a bath for his daughter !
15165,695,agent_1,did you hear roger federer ;lost ?
15166,695,agent_2,to nadal ?
15167,695,agent_1,"i am not sure , lol . i guess i should have said ' stumbe ' im referring tok the artices on the left ."
15168,695,agent_2,"federer is a fantastic palyer , hes be3n on the scrne for 13w years ."
15169,695,agent_1,i wsh iw as gopd at gtennis . i amf oo short . do you sathc it a lot ?

15175,695,agent_1,"worker as well . i like thwse hits , since they give us topics to talk about . i end up learnong a lot of random stuff lol . like that polo shirts were invitned for tennis by rene lzcoste , and then later adopted by polo plaers ."
15176,695,agent_2,"yeah ,a nd his nickname was tehc rocodile , hence the little crocodile on their shirts ."
15177,695,agent_1,"they should justc alled them ' tennis ' . like , ' hey , can you pick me up some tennis while you're there ? ' instead of ' polos '"
15178,695,agent_2,"i wonder why they took on the ame polo , maybe they didn6t catch on in tenni suntil a bit later ."
15179,695,agent_1,me . did you knw mo black man hasw on a us open since 1968 ?
15180,695,agent_2,"i didnt , i do know that they were allowed to use any item as a racket untikl 1978 ."
15181,695,agent_1,lol that's awesome
15182,695,agent_2,i could totally see someon eusing their shoe or sokething crazy like that in a pinch .
15183,695,agent_1,and you just know someone tried toj ust use their palms or fist
15184,695,agent_2,i twould be like a bad commercial !
15185,695,agent_1,i agre !
15186,696,agent_1,do yo7 frequent the library ?
15187,696,agent_2,"i do , i use to use it alot more . how avout yoy ?"
15188,696,agent_1,same . it i sq same considering i tiss uch a vast and valuable resource
15189,696,agent_2,agree . now that they have video games more tenagers going .
15190,696,agent_1,"they are trying to make a library of things that allows patrons to use useful th9ings they nee d, but don't need to own long term"
15191,696,agent_2,"yes , the library with its vast of information can help those without access to the internet do incredible th8ngs . like a malawian teenager who maked a windwill from theb ooks ."
15192,696,agent_1,i meaj a man used the lirbary to prove his innocence nd become a lawyesr while falsely imprisoned
15193,696,agent_2,how great is that ! so important . the library of alexandria had a unique way of gathering books by making all ships visiting surrender their books for c9py .
15194,696,agent_1,they must have ha da impressive ollection
15195,696,agent_2,"how uncair , they would copy their books give them back the copy and keep the originals ."
15196,696,agent_1,i guess that is true . do you think we will ever hace a centralized digital library o fall our works and knowledge ?
15197,696,agent_2,"i think so , the entertainment executive that wouldn't hire for a role , got it wrong with ronqld reagan , not having the look . lol"
15198,696,agent_1,"i guess he wasn't president ,ike for the executive , but enough so for most amerficans"
15199,696,agent_2,"lo l,k yes . i knew he liked jelly ebllies , they becmae very popular then . but , i didn't know they made bluebherry flavor for him ."
15200,696,agent_1,did you know he called ice cream nutritious and a wholesome fod . if onoly that was true
15201,696,agent_2,"i wish it so . he was also a hero in high school , saving 77 lives as a luifeguard !"
15202,696,agent_1,that is no asy feat . he sure hada n amazing career rro a hollywood actor top president
15203,696,agent_2,i agree . i like the respect eh has given the military by returning the salute in 1918 .
15204,696,agent_1,"indeed i hope our next president would be of a similar calibe . in any cas , thanks for chatting ."
15205,696,agent_2,"yes , you too . have a nice day q goosd chat"
15206,696,agent_1,the sasme to you a swell .
15207,697,agent_1,"robert m . higdon was ar eally good man , who had a short life ."
15208,697,agent_2,"i agree with you , seeing the fact that he profided good company and work to those close to him ."
15209,697,agent_1,"i am curious ax to how h became so well connected in washington , he seems to hav ehad a .ot of power ."
15210,697,agent_2,"if you see in article section 2 , you can see how his judgment slead to the sudcess of th ereagan establishments ."
15211,697,agent_1,"oh , you are right , thanks . he reall did ahve good judgements , he got to say at firstclass hktels during his international travels ."
15212,697,agent_2,"i too would provide the best servic for my employers who brought in his qyuality o fservice ! on a darker note , it's depressing to see how many deaths we had in 2018 . . ."
15213,697,agent_1,"her aised su much mney , and had a good salary , i am curious as tow hat made him choose this path of wmployment ."
15214,697,agent_2,"weol we can see how his fundraising tactics wete successful . ho3evr5 , we can see how he kay have been dishonest wit hthe money received ."
15215,697,agent_1,"eah 8 agree , i relal6y hate it when someone who many people might lookup to isn't honest with their money , it can have a bad impact on them ."
15216,697,agent_2,"exactly . however , i am curious baout whether or not donlad reagan'sf ame helped him in electing him for preesidency . if you see in factual section 2 ."
15217,697,agent_1,"hm , you are rigth , he did have a lot of connection in washington ."
15218,697,agent_2,you know whst i think it is ? education . seeing how am an was flasew imprisoned and taught himself law to prove is innocence is note worthy . that's probably how these successful people did 2ell in life
15219,697,agent_1,"that was note worthy , however there are often people who are bor ninto a rich lifestyle that can get beter quality edcation or knowf ami;y or friends who are in high position swnd i feel that is unfair . aww , he had a little dog who was a xertified therapy dog ."
15220,697,agent_2,"right ? ! thwt's probably why he did so well in office . i think if ee all had cwertified therapy dogst o help us wiht oit swork , we'd get mor done ."
15221,697,agent_1,"it's my understanding that mr . hidgeon stayed with patti davis's moter , or reagan's wife , that interests me ."
15222,697,agent_2,"ia greew ityh you . it's hard not to thin kthat he was not only family associate but almost like a family member , given al lhtat he did for their family . do you think he woud have run for presidency ?"
15223,697,agent_1,"he seemed quite intereste din politics , i thin khe might ahve run if he hadn't died .t her were several people wo were popula5r who died in 2018 ."
15224,697,agent_2,yeah i agtee with you . given his backgrund . anthony b . was an inspiration to us apll .
15225,697,agent_1,"anthony b was 61 , it mus thave beemn hard on his family , losing someone at that ages ."
15226,697,agent_2,"true , like robert higdon , he was successful in his area of expedtise . speaking of food related stuff , i wonder what ronald raegans favorite ice cream was ."
15227,697,agent_1,good question ! i know that he liked ice cream so much he established national ice cream month .
15228,697,agent_2,is itb ad tat everyday is national ic ecream month . . . but whats' surprising is how there ins't mujch of a differexcne compared to a presidents list of duties .
15229,697,agent_1,"presidents are so busy , many people don't realize tings that the must do , or how they have to do kt . before the electiosn campaigning is qa lot of hard work , they have to travel to so many different states ."
15230,697,agent_2,exactly . i'm cu8riouz to know what it fels like o have that much power . or at least be an affiliate to someone with high level of pwer . kind of like higdon's position .
15231,697,agent_1,"i know there's a documentary on reagan's presidency , there are probably othe3r documentaries that would give a lerspective on what it's like to be president ."
15232,697,agent_2,thanks for that ! would you want to hav ethe name if a prime minister or opresiden t?
15233,697,agent_1,"i wouldr ecommend mqrgaret htatcher , she rise to power in britain and the bbc ordered ad ocumentary on her ."
15234,697,agent_2,"thuan kyou . if you have time , i would suggst watchin anthony b's documentary on his food adventures . i5 was very nice talking to you ."
15235,698,agent_1,have you ever heard of robert m . higdon ? he's new to me .
15236,698,agent_2,he i sprettt new to me as well . i heard he was big in the development o freagan's presidential library .
15237,698,agent_1,"i've always been curious what a presidential library is . nev4er been to one , have this picture in my head of a regular library , must be different ."
15238,698,agent_2,"i wonder the same thing , i wonder if it is just a library that he hrlped tol fund and sponsor , there is a museum too . i wonder what that has in it ."
15239,698,agent_1,"seems he did similar thing for teh british pm , thatcher ."
15240,698,agent_2,maybe he just really loved all that liraries have to offert and sa wa lot of vlaue in them .
15241,698,agent_1,"my daughter loves libraries , she loves to read . i' glad she does , she reqds a book a day . its aves us a lot of moeny ."
15242,698,agent_2,"the uk pm back in 1895 founded a library andw he4elbarrowed his collection of 32 , 000 vooks almost a mile to the lirbary ."
15243,698,agent_1,"i hope it wasn't raining ! i might want to publish a book in norway , a guaratneed 1000 sold to the government ."
15244,698,agent_2,"then they get put on libraries , so they are supporting authors andr eading . i think that is fan6tastic !"
15245,698,agent_1,"agree d, reading i swholesome an nutritious for the brain . not sure reagan's idea that ice cream was the same for the body is right ."
15246,698,agent_2,"he had some great ideas , thatw asn't one of tnem . i love ice cream and all , but it isn't exactly nutritious ."
15247,698,agent_1,"wre i to live in japan and live to a 100 , i could have my ice c5ream in a silver cup from the pm ?"
15248,698,agent_2,"that is pretty cool , they probably hadt o start finding a cheaper way to make cups . it seems that there woudl be a lot of peoplem akin git to 10 0in apan , versus the us ."
15249,698,agent_1,"i like the idea of libraries expanding to other things , like the sacramento library where you can get things that ussful lioke ewin gmachines ."
15250,698,agent_2,"i think that is qa great idea , that way people can chckout things that they might need . it is a great way of community sharing ."
15251,698,agent_1,"i wonder if you can check out things from presidential libraries ? i suspectn ot , probably more like a museum ."
15252,698,agent_2,"probably , especially it there is uniq2ue things that cn't be replaced . one thing that is hopeful for the country is there are more libraries than mcdonalds in the us . yay ror reading !"
15253,698,agent_1,definitely not wholesome and nutritious . i'm sure mcdonald's are working on that one .
15254,698,agent_2,there is a amn who was wrongly convicted in jail and spent hos time in the prison library reading lasw books and thenb ecame a lawyer .
15255,698,agent_1,"probably a cheaper wa6y than going t college and getting all those tudentl oans . still , the environment would not be nice ."
15256,698,agent_2,"he then used his skill tyoh elp otherz that were in his situation , falsely convicted people . which is pretty neat ."
15257,698,agent_1,"have a good , nice speaking with yku ."
15258,699,agent_1,ha ! i always suspected this ! aaddin's pants were modeled afterm c hammer .
15259,699,agent_2,haha the mystry has been solved ! have you heard thy are cominga outw ith a new aladdi n? with will smith .
15260,699,agent_1,"yeah , iv'e seen the stills . i don't like the way it lookzs really ."
15261,699,agent_2,"yeah , me either . the previous makes you cuious , but tehn i saw some pics online , now i just hsve mixed feelings ."
15262,699,agent_1,disney has been making all these liveaction remaeks . ugh . i'm not sure they are correct here about opants or trousers only existing because of horses . people in very cold countries wore them to keep warm too .
15263,699,agent_2,"yeah , that does seem dd when i read it too . difgferent jobs in teh oden times requird pants as well . i totally agree with the cold weather too ."
15264,699,agent_1,they must have left sonething out . perhaps it should have read people in temperate climates began wearing pants to ride horses ?
15265,699,agent_2,"collinsville , il has a law that prohibits ' saggy pants . ' o feel like this should be everywhere haha"
15266,699,agent_1,"saggy pants are annoying , but i don;t see how they can legally force people not to dress like this ."
15267,699,agent_2,5000 year old shoes perfomr better than moxern shoes . thats really interesting too .
15268,699,agent_1,"again , what do they mean by that ? alst longer ? fit better ?"
15269,699,agent_2,"its very vague . and if htey alreafy know this , why dont they maek shoew more like before ."
15270,699,agent_1,"w4ell, , the shoes back then wer eoften custommade , that was why i assumed it might be bett4r fitting ."
15271,699,agent_2,"puttingd ry tea ags ins melly shoes or gym bags will absorb the unpleasant odor . ive actually tied this with my snowboarring boo6s , and it works really well ."
15272,699,agent_1,"tea elavfes ca ncure a lot of prob,ems . they could havr 4xpalined the stephon marbury one better too .w as this a charity venture ?"
15273,699,agent_2,i d not know .
15274,699,agent_1,it sounds like it . like how paul neman didnt' get paid for nis food companythe profits are donated to char9ty .
15275,699,agent_2,have you experience any virtual reality devises ?
15276,699,agent_1,"yes , my cousin got one last christmas . and one o fmy best friends also owns a headset ."
15277,699,agent_2,"myb rother in law has one , that device is amazin g. also , really scary , it was like a haunted house simulation or something ."
15278,699,agent_1,she ha dmostly outdoor scenes . this is coollockheed martin has a virtual reality ' mars bus ' that can take kids on a tour o fmars .
15279,699,agent_2,that would be itneresting to experience .
15280,700,agent_1,hello . wha tdo yoh think of virula reality ? i recently learned that the first virtual realityg ame was made in 9168 !
15281,700,agent_2,"hello , i'm a fan for sure ! i think it' samazin gbeing able to rransport yourself to an imaginary environmetn and even look around and interact with things , i had no idea the technology existed that long ago !"
15282,700,agent_1,i didn't either until recently . sokme of its eems to be geared towards kids and i wish it wasn't . take for exmaple lockheed martin . htey have a virtual reality bus that takes kids on a tour of mqrs . i would like to do that too .
15283,700,agent_2,"that's crazy , i'm sure a lot of people take advantage of it . althnough i wonder how kids feel with 8t , i know a lot of people experience motikon sicknes sin virtualr eality , maybe they couldn't handle it ."
15284,700,agent_1,i neve rthought about getting motion sickness fr4om i tbefore . i guess it is possible since the brain is perceiving two realities .
15285,700,agent_2,"i wonder if the headsets ahve improved since 1968 . i know originally , it was a stereoscopic headmounted display rendering computergeneraed images , but i'ms ure it was bulkier bac kthen , an dmaybe lighter and easier to use now ."
15286,700,agent_1,with the improvements on computers the hesadsets are proabbly a lot smaller and lighter than before . did you know that the scientist who discovered some of saturn's moons thinks that we are livin gi na comouter generat6ed virtual reality ?
15287,700,agent_2,"wow , as much as i want to call him insane he seems more qualified than me , but i'm still a skeptic . are you interested in clkthing at all ?"
15288,700,agent_1,i am interested in clothing . i think it'sv ery funhy to realize tah tthe romans thought htat wearing pants was a sign of barbarism !
15289,700,agent_2,"well i can see hwere they're coming from ! i think the only reason peole do wear pants is because to ride a hrs4 in an aemy , it was more effective to wea rpants than roebs ."
15290,700,agent_1,yrs itw as unless you were in britain where they rode side saddle . a lot of things arse cifferent there . htey consider trouserd to be underwear where americ aconsiddrs trusers to be pants .
15291,700,agent_2,"that's really hard to imagine , for us i'm sure that seems insane . then again , we have our own culpture that dictates fashion , i know mc hamemr's pants ispire da lot of thinge , even aladdin's pants !"
15292,700,agent_1,i never knew that ! i thought that aladdin's pantsw ere from how hte people in htat clountry dressed long ago .
15293,700,agent_2,"ahah i thought so also , i guess the culture around pants has cahnged a kot in modern days . i r3mebmer one ot th3e craziest things i saw in the news was a nudg esuing a dry cleaning business for oiver 67 jillion just over one pair lf pants ."
15294,700,agent_1,wo wi haven't heard about that ! why did he sue them ? were the pants messed up in some way ?
15295,700,agent_2,"i believe the pants got lost ! still that much mone for one pair ? maybe he only had saggy pants left and was from collinsville , illinois where they prohibi tthem !"
15296,700,agent_1,"that is way way too much money for one pair and i hope he lost his cass . however , being a judge he proably didn't . now i do know about the collinsville law . what i would like to know s just how do they enforce it . what is toos aggy ?"
15297,700,agent_2,"exactly ! i wonder wher ethe line ends too . i bet they have a similar rule for shoes , like you can't have shoes too dusty or something !"
15298,700,agent_1,of too smelly ! what they need in that case is some dry tea bags . those are supposed to absorb odors in shoes .
15299,700,agent_2,"i nee dto use that ! i think i havbe olr gym shoes that could use them . i definitely don't want to throw them oit eveb though they are very old , because i believe very old shoes actually perform bette4r than new shoes !"
15300,700,agent_1,h they definitely do ! sehoes s far badck as 5000 years ago are made so much better than today sadn out perform todays shoes by miles .
15301,700,agent_2,"that's crazy , i hope i can someuhow find them on the marke to test out the theory myself . anways , it was nice cgatting with you , have a nice day !"

15334,702,agent_2,"it is difticult to be a musician . it takes practice and time abd talent and i deo not have any of these . i think that the guitar is the coolest of all inxtruments , cooler than the 0boe and bassoon ."
15335,702,agent_1,"yes , lov4 love to be able to play music on a guita r, some queen or pink floyd would be grsat ."
15336,702,agent_2,"those are classic bands with great songs . i fyou could play those songs , you would get all kinds of friends . you would be a star on the guitar . what kind of costuke would you wear though"
15337,702,agent_1,i'm fairly conservative when it comes to clothing . i would certainly not wear what elton john used to in the seventies .
15338,702,agent_2,ej was a trendsetterw ho stood out from the crowd . i could not wear his clothes i npublic . i would feel awkward . you would have to wear something to be as tar though . maybed ress as a saunflower ?
15339,702,agent_1,"he can wear what ae wants , he's sold oer 300 million records . i doubt if he cares how people judge him ."
15340,702,agent_2,"ig uess he coudl wander abut in the buff ifh e so chose . he has zold mzny records and his style is not the reason for that . je dan be a free spirit . elton , wherever you are ,f ly free . you diva ."

15344,703,agent_1,hey ! i sas thinking of seeing elton john in concert . tickets are aroun d2555 bucks . does that sound reasonable ?
15345,703,agent_2,that is a good pric for the man who sang ' candle in the wind 1997 '
15346,703,agent_1,especially since he has over 50 top 40 hits . i can't believe he has sold over 300 million record sand i get to see him live !
15347,703,agent_2,good for you ! seven consecutive number one albums isa lso an ipressive record .
15348,703,agent_1,"no joke q i really hope his lyricist since 1967 , bernie taupin , will be there !"
15349,703,agent_2,what is elton john's real name ? i forget .
15350,703,agent_1,his current name is sir elton herules john but he was born reginald kenneth dwight ! i didn't realiz ehe changed so ucy agout himsel fjust to perform .
15351,703,agent_2,true . i wonde rf he will hcange it back . when was he born ? i know he is retiring from touring .
15352,703,agent_1,he as born the 25 of march in 1947 . i did not realize how old he was ! the songwriting partner i was talking about was born in 1967 . i also didn't know there was sucyh an age difference .

15469,708,agent_1,"bice , did now know tha t, thought maybe tony stark ws , he seems to have z lot o fmon4y"
15470,708,agent_2,yeah black panther has an estimated worth of 500 billion !t hat is a lot of money
15471,708,agent_1,wow that sure is . the guy who did the voice of jarvis has never seen tfhe movies
15472,708,agent_2,"wow , jarvis also stands for just a rather very intelpliyent system"
15473,708,agent_1,yea hand it is voiced by paul bettany . do you know why stan lee created ironman ?
15474,708,agent_2,i did know that . did you know the spacesgips in thor are named after old australian cars ?
15475,708,agent_1,"haha thgat i sso cool , did not know tuat . the actor that plays loki originally auditioned for the rol eof thor"
15476,708,agent_2,awesome . odin's ravens in thor alspa ppezar in the avengers film too
15477,708,agent_1,"nice , there is so much overlap with these movies"
15478,709,agent_1,do you watch any of te marve lmovies ? they are sone of my favorites
15479,709,agent_2,i love marvel movies . i really like the first iron man . i'm super impressed that obet downey jr . improvised it all .
15480,709,agent_1,"there wasn't even a script ! no wonder it wss such a great movie ! he only made 500k for that first movie , too !"
15481,709,agent_2,"yeah , i read he made 10 million for the second one ."
15482,709,agent_1,sometimes it pays to stick around for the sequel . the person who does the voice f jarvis has never actually watched the movies
15483,709,agent_2,wow . that's crazy . stan lee created iron man because ye didn't think anyone would like him . i gess you never know wha'ts going to happen
15484,709,agent_1,he'st he kind of guy that we love to hate . stan lee is a genius though for cresting all the hrroes that he has
15485,709,agent_2,did you hear thatd isney doesn't own the rights to bigm arvel characters in theme parks easta of the mississippi ?
15486,709,agent_1,"isn'f that due to a deal they made wiht universao studios ? some of th erides at their park are based off marvel characters , and that woudl be hard to move"
15487,709,agent_2,"yeah , i guess it was becaus eof a deal they signed with universal studios in the 90s"
15488,709,agent_1,but they could utilize the marvsl character swest oft he mississippi if they wanted . both marvel and dc both own one cfharacter for th esole purpose of keeping the universes separate
15489,709,agent_2,"yeah , ih erd his name is access . funny name considering what he is used for ."
15490,709,agent_1,very true . i wonder if that 2as q name that stan lee came up with . he did create one called blue ear just for a 4 year old who needed hearinga ids
15491,709,agent_2,"i don't know , these c9ntract deals are awlays so weird .aw pparently fox didn'tt hink marvel was worth 25 million , so they only bought spjdsrman for 10 million"
15492,709,agent_1,"they did mae t2o version of him i nthe time they had the rights , qand now they've made a deal with marvel . they definitely didn'ts ee that outcome"
15493,709,agent_2,did you hear marvel successfully argued in court that mutants are not peop;le ? it goes against he whole idea behind the xmen
15494,709,agent_1,"i'm surprised the judg went for that one , but mazyeb they were unfamilia rwith the movies . that's a st5range argument to get a lower rate than that for dolls"
15495,709,agent_2,"i mean they are toy7s , and not doll s. so i sorta agrre ."
15496,709,agent_1,"i guess it depends on ykur perspective . ike , i wonder why thor got his first movie before antma nwhen antmna was created first"
15497,709,agent_2,because thor is more popular .
15498,709,agent_1,did they maek that decision based in comic books sales . sometimes i wonder what the deciding factors are
15499,710,agent_1,"hllo there , did you see the iron man movis ?"
15500,710,agent_2,"i saw that in theatres years ago , itg ot me oving mqrvel moves , how about you ?"
15501,710,agent_1,"i actually never saw th emovie for some reason , but heard that toy stark has a lot o fmoney ."
15502,710,agent_2,i heard he is worth 100 billion in the films
15503,710,agent_1,"tha tis crazy , and the real robert downey onlym ade 500 , 00 for the first on ebut then 10 mill for the 2nd !"
15504,710,agent_2,"man , that was a big pay increase loil . k didn't like iron man 2 too much"
15505,710,agent_1,yeah htat is a crazy ay raise from one to the next ! i didn't realize the first film did so well .
15506,710,agent_2,"for sure , i just reemmber leving the thetres thinking what an awesome movie ! who would have guessed what was to come after that . do you know paul bettany ?"
15507,710,agent_1,i think he did some of the voices in the movies right ?
15508,710,agent_2,he was jarvis in those movies . apparently he neverw atcned htem lol
15509,710,agent_1,lol that id hklarious ! i don't know how you wouldn't want to see the tinal product you have been workinh on .
15510,710,agent_2,"right , maybe he was made mad he wzs just a voice"
15511,710,agent_1,"lol , well i'm sureh e waesn't mad when he got his paycheck forj ust being a voic3e ."
15512,710,agent_2,"for sure , that ist he perfect job for me . shy on camera but can talk on the radio if i enededt o lol"
15513,710,agent_1,"yeah i wouldn't mind just being a voic e, i always wanted to work for my local radio station lol ."
15514,710,agent_2,"me too , lol . i don't think i tpays much . do you like marvle comicds in general ?"
15515,710,agent_1,"yeah i used to read qujte a bit gen i was yo7nger , how about you ?"
15516,710,agent_2,"met oo , who was you rfavorite character ?"
15517,710,agent_1,"i would say wolverine for surr , how about you ?"
15518,710,agent_2,"yreat choice , i would say the xmen in general i loved growing up . i like deadpool now , thosee ere great movies and comics !"
15519,710,agent_1,"yeah i liked that deadpool was rated r lo l. anyways , it's reben nice chatting wit hyou , i hope uou have a good day !"
15520,711,agent_1,"hi , do yoyu like any of the superhero films ;"
15521,711,agent_2,yes i enjoy many of them . hwicbh one ise your favorite ?
15522,711,agent_1,"it's hard to choose one , ir eally like the captain america and the iroh mah movies , how about you ?"
15523,711,agent_2,"while my favorite is hulk , i did really like the captain america movie . it's the best of both worlds because he meets up with tony stark ."
15524,711,agent_1,"yes true . thor is pretty goo dzas well , the hulk was seen as an immesne green sybmol of kinship to thor in the movie ."
15525,711,agent_2,i really enjoyed hte rslationship fhat thor and huok had in thor : ragnarok . i really think they worked well togeher ? if they had to square up and fight who do you think would have the upper hand ?
15526,711,agent_1,that's a tough question . . . . i would have to say hulk only because he has seniority on thor i think . . . lol !
15527,711,agent_2,ysah that would be an epic batter . i wonder where marvel got all there inspiration for these characters . i know matrvel has bedn zroujd snce 1939 but when disney took over they reallys tarted amking excellent films .
15528,711,agent_1,"yes , the creativity in the charqcters is really great , it wuld be fun to find out what or who inspired each character . i didn't kjow that marvle had been aroubnd since 1939 ."
15529,711,agent_2,heah they really started to take off when stan lee and jack kirby started to create . they made the rantastic four also .
15530,711,agent_1,oh that's another great one ! i see that iron man is the first film in the marvrl cinemativ universe .
15531,711,agent_2,ye s .iron ma nwas wildly popular . do you think it was such a hit because of the character of iron jman himelf or because of the acting of robert downey jr . ?
15532,711,agent_1,"you know , i was just wondering that also , i think robertd owny jr is the perfect actor for the psart , i c0uldn't imagine anyonee lse . i would have to say it's because of him in this particular part . what do you think ?"
15533,711,agent_2,"i think his actimg was great but i also think that iron man himself draws in a crowd . his costume just looks sog reat . i have younge4 kids myself and we enjoy watching it together . i think that other actors could have done equally well . of al lthe costumes an dweapons , what would be your favorite of the characters ?"
15534,711,agent_1,"oh wow , i couldn't choose just one . his costume stands out to em , so i w9uld choose it ."
15535,711,agent_2,right . for me i am intrigued by the hamemr from thor . i wish i yad that thing to swing around at my will . i enjoyed watching him use it while teaming up with hulk .
15536,711,agent_1,"ha ha , true ! i also like how the avengers lewarn how to cast aside indovidual egos and pug their strengths together for greater good ."
15537,711,agent_2,"yeah to me th eavengers shows a power struggle on which superhero will be the leader . i think htar iron man takes the cake . 5hroughout the conversation we did not bring up perhaps the most famous superhero of the marvel bunch , none other that spiderman"
15538,711,agent_1,"i was just thinking the dsame thing , when you askedj e about costunes , he came to mind . i really do like spiderman as well ."
15539,711,agent_2,"me too , the homecoming series has been my favorite of th ebunch . i would love to see a peterd parker and tony stark mvie wyere they both are unaware of gheir special powers ."
15540,711,agent_1,that?s a great idra for a movid storyline !

15617,715,agent_2,no h edid not . i wached that first also and was shocked when he became an action star . did ylu know that one frame of the rai nsoaked trex takes six hiurs tor endetr ? that's an insane amount of work .
15618,715,agent_1,the raptors haqd humans inside of teh suits ? that seems more zrcheaic thsn i would have thought .
15619,715,agent_2,really ? ! i zssumed they were entiorely cg . i have to imagine that they qt least used some cg over teh practical .
15620,715,agent_1,i would think so . di dyou ever read the crichton book jussaric park ?
15621,715,agent_2,"i did nog . it ess ecerywhere whe i was a ,id and it seemed like everyone wzs but i just never got around to it ."

15627,715,agent_2,i absolutely agr4e . i would love to know wha tmaeks that possible . anoth3r interesting fact is that the seahorse i sthe only fish with a neck .
15628,715,agent_1,nice chatting with you !
15629,716,agent_1,"it sure has been raining a lot lately , i wonder if thats the reason of the increase on xragonflies"
15630,716,agent_2,"it seem so . since there is ore rain , there are ore mosquitosf or the dragonflies to feast on ."
15631,716,agent_1,"i so they feast on mosquitos , than kdragonflies then lo l ,i just hate mosquitos , althouth dragonflies are kind of scary"
15632,716,agent_2,"apparnetly a dragonfly can eat 30 mosquitos a day . like you said , thank you dragonflies ! i didn't realize dragonflies wetre such predator . all their wings lalow tyem fly better than their prey ."
15633,716,agent_1,i think it sinteresting how dragonflies form ac losed circle in a shape of a heart when they are amting
15634,716,agent_2,i can't realy imagine hw that works . who knew dragonflies were so romantic ? i guess when you only live for less than a year you make the most of your life .
15635,716,agent_1,"i guess so lol , tey sure are takihg advantage of their time one arth ,m injsects are onterestin , have you ever eaten somethng with carmine or cachineal extract in it ?"
15636,716,agent_2,maybe ? i'm not even sure what taht is .
15637,716,agent_1,"well it san ingredient founxd on some food and on the red 4 colorant , when you see a label with any of those ingredient beware as you are eating crushed up bugs ."
15638,716,agent_2,"whst ? really ? i did not know tbat ! i have hdard of bugs being used to color nail polish and other comsetics , but i was unaware it was in food . i don't know what to think abou gthat . do i remain oblivious or research it more ?"
15639,716,agent_1,"maybe oblivious as you might be surprise , i ould rather remain in ignorance lol , there is a species of insects called gold bugs ."
15640,716,agent_2,are gold bugs like beetels or flying bugs ? i don't like bugs that fly . jus6 like you said dragonflies are scary . they mpve fast an come out of nowhere .
15641,716,agent_1,"ji think yhey are totally different , their rsal name i sextremophiles they breath dissolve gold and excrete it in a solid form"
15642,716,agent_2,"oh my gosh , you are a wealth of knolwedge . i love it"
15643,716,agent_1,"bugs sure are interesting , to think they can be found in almost every environment !"
15644,716,agent_2,i imagine that there is a vast amoujnt of species of insects and bugs . i never would've realized that there are even bugs in the ocrean .
15645,716,agent_1,"apparently there are , did you know that 90 percent of all animals on earth are actually insects , no wonder why my place is full with mosquitos ."
15646,716,agent_2,"you need to get ou some dragonflies to deal wit hthose mosquitoes . where i live sand gnats are a huge ssue , b8t i nebver see any dragonflies helping me out . i guess ypu would need a source of water nearby to be able to host the dragonfly nymphs before they hatch ."
15647,716,agent_1,"i think i will do that , hopefully it work sif now i will have two problems instead of one lol !"

15671,717,agent_2,thank you my ftiend it was great
15672,718,agent_1,good morning . putting on my polo shirt which ironically was invented for tnenis .
15673,718,agent_2,who invented the shirt ?
15674,718,agent_1,rene ' the crocodile ' lacost4e was the inventor .
15675,718,agent_2,"oh , this is the famous izod shirt ? i guess there is also polo hirts , which are worn mostly by people no playing polo . the hawaiians have the 5itht idea about office attire ."
15676,718,agent_1,for sure . i'e rather wear the aloha shirt than a suit and tie any day .
15677,718,agent_2,"in he uk , they call the mtrousers , but we in the us cal lthem ' pants . '"
15678,718,agent_1,some cities actually have laws prohibitin g' saggy pants'
15679,718,agent_2,"i think it's a sloppy look , and p;robably a bit too revealing for some folks . i laughed when i saw that a d . c . judged sued a dry cleaner for millions over a lost pair of pants . i wonderw hefher it was for pain and suffering ."
15680,718,agent_1,"year , 67 million to bee xact . thzt's crazy . he should have been fined for such a frivolous lawsuit like that ."
15681,718,agent_2,"it's an abuse of judicil power , rven if the judge hired a awyer . i would expect a judge t throw ouf suits like that , since they clogx up the aystem ."
15682,718,agent_1,"ia gree comp0etelg . i wobder what his pants looked like l now if they wdre aalddin's pangs which were modeled after mc hammer's pants , maybe they would be worth 67 million ."
15683,718,agent_2,i honestly expecte dmc hammer's pants to be modelped after aladdin' s. ot seems strange that the romans thouht pant wereb arbaric . i wionder why pants seme uncivilized .
15684,718,agent_1,"not s8ure , but apparently pants were originally worn by mounted armied on horszeback ."
15685,718,agent_2,"i wonder how the romans felt about socks , especially with hte sandals that they wore ."
15686,718,agent_1,i bet if got cold tho8gh they could do like the japanese and put chile peppers in the socks to keep thei ttoes wearm .
15687,718,agent_2,that would make for some interesting smelling feet . i didn't know that socks were riginally designed to eb worn with sandals . nowadays the loo kis considered a goofy dad look .
15688,718,agent_1,"yeah , i only do that if i'm running out t get the mail or somethingy ."
15689,718,agent_2,"the foot produces a lot of sweag , so the socks help absorb it . maybe if a celebrity made thel ook popular , it would be aceptable generally ."
15690,718,agent_1,"probably so . like if billy mays work them with hisb lue shirts and khaki pants , that might have worked ."
15691,718,agent_2,who is villy mays ?
15692,718,agent_1,"he was the informercial guy , sold oxy cleam for years ."
15693,718,agent_2,i've nesver heard of him . did he always wear blue shirts and khaki pants ?
15694,718,agent_1,"that was his thing . wll , it's been nice cha5ting with you this morning ."
15695,718,agent_2,nice chatting ! bye

15697,719,agent_2,"i like t shirts . i don'tc are for xress shirts , or shirts that hav a vertical opening with buttons ."
15698,719,agent_1,do you have a favorite branf or designer ?
15699,719,agent_2,not necessarily . i guess if i had to choose it would be nike or under armour . i wonder if they could wear them in hawaii whre they get to wear aloha shirts to work instead of suit and tie .
15700,719,agent_1,i lke unser armour too . the hage grea moisture wicking shirts
15701,719,agent_2,that wouldn't work too well in chinad urng the cultural revolution where they layered as msny shirts as possible .
15702,719,agent_1,do you believew e should buy shirts and clothes frok china ?
15703,719,agent_2,i have no problem with it . restricting trade between china and us would only hurt us consumers . j wonder if they ban ' saggy pants ' in china like they do in collinsville ?
15704,719,agent_1,saggy pants ands kinny jeans should be banned everywere
15705,719,agent_2,that's funny .w hat else is funny is tuat a judge in d . c once sued a dry cleaner for losing a pair o his pants .
15706,719,agent_1,wow . the chinese like to dress in layers and started the ' po0p you collar ' craze .
15707,719,agent_2,i heard that . funny how fads start . the tomans actually though wearing pants were a sign of barbarism .
15708,719,agent_1,it was only recsntly were congresswoman allowed to wear skirs on the house or senate floor
15709,719,agent_2,i know . that doesmn't sound right . should hage bene like that long before .t hat judg ethat i spoke of earlier sued for y7 million for lost pants . that's crazy .
15710,719,agent_1,did he win his case ? seem like al ot of money to sue for over pants .
15711,719,agent_2,i imagine not . no judge should have been allowed to do tha . it is a totally frivolous lawsuit .
15712,719,agent_1,"for aure , ifa nybody ehoudl know that 8it would be him ."
15713,719,agent_2,it's not like the dry cleaner lost mc hammer's iconic pants .t hose were actua;lly what the creators of aladdin used as a model for his pants .
15714,719,agent_1,maybe that is why thy sued tor so much because of how valuable they were
15715,719,agent_2,"possib,y . well , it's been nice chatting with you ."
15716,719,agent_1,you s well .

15723,720,agent_1,"yes , in fact amazopn had a vieo where homrpless someone would ask homeless whwt they needed and they saix socks , then a xouple hours later it was delivered !"
15724,720,agent_2,"that is nice . did you know that collinsville , has a law that prohibits 'saggy pants ' , weird ?"
15725,720,agent_1,they had that in my school . did you know the rmans viewed pants as barbaric ?
15726,720,agent_2,"yes . speaking about it , alladin's pants were modeled after mc hammer ."
15727,720,agent_1,"wow , you would think it wa sthe other way around . the brits call them trousers"
15728,720,agent_2,"i know , and a s . c . judgr s7ed a small dry cleaning business for over 67 million for the loss of a pair of pants ."
15729,720,agent_1,the oldest surviving pair of socks ever found ws designed to wear with sandals
15730,720,agent_2,"you know with all the drama that was said inm the end , all that matters is doing whats best for my client . taht is how bussiness works ."

15752,721,agent_1,i was surprised yo hewr taht black panther isd actually the riches tsuperhero . always thought that waw batman .
15753,721,agent_2,it's that vibranium money ! i would take either amount though . . .
15754,721,agent_1,"speaking of chadwick boseman , did you kno whe has a pastw ith denzel washington !"
15755,721,agent_2,i d8d not know that . . . do you know how ?
15756,721,agent_1,"denzrel paid for bosemant o go to an oxford theater program , then tey meta t the prejiere of black panther ."

15761,721,agent_2,i heard that . i think she was perfeclty cast in that movie . anyone bigger would have tak3n away from teh movie .
15762,721,agent_1,can you imagine mery streep even a younger one in that role ?
15763,721,agent_2,i am not sjure i could see her in that role . i see her as to regl now . . . am i right in thinking that ?
15764,721,agent_1,"perhaps , although her first fio mrole was in a sports movie ."
15765,721,agent_2,i did not know that . nice chatting with you !
15766,722,agent_1,have you seen the black panther movie ?
15767,722,agent_2,no i have not see it yet but i really watn to . i know its an all african american cast and nhistoric in that way .
15768,722,agent_1,yes . it was pretty good . i won't share any mofie revealing details then if you haven't see it . the blank panthers has an estimated 500 billion dollars nad is the richest superhero .
15769,722,agent_2,wow . i know it's the richest superherlo in history too . the marvel omics chjaacter black panther was not named after the black panther party . whichu i jiust learned .
15770,722,agent_1,that's correct . the sybmols and written script from hte movie are based on an acutal cript claled sibdi .
15771,722,agent_2,"aamzing , i love when things are historical i na movie because it makes it more believable . cahdwick boseman was accepted in to a prestigious summer theater program at oxford university gbut coldn't afford it ."
15772,722,agent_1,i see thath e secured funding through a private benefactor who t7rned out to be denzel wahsington !
15773,722,agent_2,"oh wow , noway ! i didn't know that part of the story . how cool would that be ! wawhington made a good investmenf in the guyw ho turned out vlack panther , wow ."
15774,722,agent_1,yes ! and over 2 0years later chadwivk thanked him in person at thr premiere of black panthe r. did you see the wonder woman movie ?
15775,722,agent_2,"so cool . yes , i love wonder woman . thr actress who plays herg al gadot didn't even know that she was auditioning for wonder woman at the time she was doing it ."
15776,722,agent_1,yes . i found it interesting that she srved 2 years as a soldier in the israel defensef orces so she kind of had ezpredience for the role .
15777,722,agent_2,"that's an amazing personal history not many peop,e yave , relaly inredibl e. gal gadot thought that day she auditioned that she was trying for catwoman . that is sort of funny . shes just tat good ."
15778,722,agent_1,that is funny ! woncer woman 9is bot hthe highest grossijg superhero origin movie and the highest ww1 movie too !
15779,722,agent_2,"neat ! i never heard that fact befor e. i am also a hug4 meryl strep fan . her first film was s sport sfilm hich seems like an 0dd fit nut xhe mad eit work , i guess ."
15780,722,agent_1,i've always liked her ! she audit9oned fort he lead role in the 1976 king kong movie . the otoducer said she was ugly . what an insuklt !
15781,722,agent_2,oh yeah and the funny part of that story is that she speask italian fluently ! so she responded to his insult in his own language . lol
15782,722,agent_1,right ! lol she has been nominated for an academy awawrd 18 times !
15783,722,agent_2,"yes , she has received 31 golden globe nominations , winning eight more nlminations and sins than any other actor ."
15784,722,agent_1,ymjsy
15785,722,agent_2,"meryl streep's daughter id also an actress . she plays teh fbi agent on mr . robot , grace bummer . 6hat's a good legacy ."
15786,722,agent_1,sorry i hit the enter button bya ccident . i didn't know that . how interesting . i seen where stanly tucci make meryl cook with him to prepare for julie and julia . neat .
15787,722,agent_2,"yes , they cooked together to really g3t in6to character . i bet that food was incredible to snack on during the making of the film !"
15788,722,agent_1,i would have been hungry all he time smelling that on the set ! lol i have to get running . it was nice chatting with you !
15789,723,agent_1,have you watched black panther ?
15790,723,agent_2,"i haven't seen i tyet , but i bought it to wstch when i have free time . i tend to takef orver to get around to seeing movies , even though i've read critics' opinions . you ?"
15791,723,agent_1,yeah i want to watch it th0ugh i have not found the time yet l black panther is the richest superhero so he must be pretty good .
15792,723,agent_2,"crazy to think there's a superhero richedr than iron man . i guess thor doesn't really count , since he's a god ."
15793,723,agent_1,"xd . tony stark is only wprk 100 bilion , bruce wayune 80 billion while black panther is worth 500 billion ."
15794,723,agent_2,"i wish i wer4 ' only ; worth 100 billion . black panther basically owns a country , though , so those numbers make sense . hadn't thought about batman , either ."
15795,723,agent_1,it's interesting taht the script in black panther is based on an actual ancient text . i thought it was just made up .
15796,723,agent_2,i didn't know that . i don' tthink many superhero movbies sre basee on source materila that old . i wonder if that makes people fr9m the ancient text's regioj feel closer to them ovie .
15797,723,agent_1,speaking of cultral tyhings marvel censored ' praise hanuman ' in indian release sof black panther hinking it would be culturally insensitive .b ut indians reacted negatively as they fund that empowering rather than insulting .
15798,723,agent_2,"that reminds me of loony toons removng speedy gonzales hte mouse , which upset people from mexico because he was a favorite character there . maybe companies should actual;y ask the people they think they're offneding before censorng things ."
15799,723,agent_1,"ha , you are right . when wonder woman first appeared as a memner of the justice society she was the secretary . i wonder if that offended anyone ."
15800,723,agent_2,"her al.sso of tuth could see through anyone' slies about why they were late for appoinmtents ! but yes , it probably did . there's always someonse looking to be offended . it causes problems when it prev4nts someone from being themsefvles , though ."
15801,723,agent_1,"gel gadot , the new wonder woman , served two years sas a solcier in the israel defense forces . things have changed a bit !"
15802,723,agent_2,"she sounds like a wonder woman in real life , not just the wonder woman character ! that movie was successful enough to change a lot of things , like what the highestgrossing superhero origin movie was ."
15803,723,agent_1,it isf unnyt hat gal gadot didn't know she was auditioning for wonder woma n.
15804,723,agent_2,i hear dshe was auditionng for catwoman . imagine trying to be a villain and ending up perfect for a superhero q
15805,723,agent_1,"ah , so true ! and wonder woman isn't only the highest grossing superhero origin movie it is the highes tgrossxing qwi movie . pretty cool ."
15806,723,agent_2,it also seemed lik ei trdid better than most other dc m9ovies . that franchise hasn't been as successful as marvel overall .
15807,723,agent_1,the success of wonder w3omanh as taught hololywood that boys will happoly accept a female siperhero .
15808,723,agent_2,"moxst people will accept anything if the surreounding movie is good neough , but wonder woman definitel paved teh way for more acceptance once they realized that the supe5hero's demographic doesn't define the film the effort ev3ryone puts into the film does ."
15809,723,agent_1,you're right . films need to be evaluated objectively without thinkign about identity politics .
15810,724,agent_1,have you watched black ;anther
15811,724,agent_2,"hello fhere , no i have not seen it yet but i realy want to . how about you ?"
15812,724,agent_1,i haven'te ither . it must have been a good movie . bklack panthe ris the richest superhero .
15813,724,agent_2,yeah i can't imagine there being super heroes more wealthy thsan bruce wayne an dmr . stark vbut i guess ther eis .
15814,724,agent_1,apparently black panthe ris woth 500 billion but tony stsrk is worth 100 billion and bruce wayne 80 billion .
15815,724,agent_2,yeah see and it's not even close !
15816,724,agent_1,i think it's cool that the symbols and script in the film are based on an actual scrip tcalled nsibdi .
15817,724,agent_2,"yeah that is eally cool , i like when actual facts and real history are used in movies ."
15818,724,agent_1,"bnut apparently they censored ' praise hanuman ' in indian releases thinking they would get backlash for a villainous character praising a hindu god . the6y thought that it was mepowering , not insulting ."
15819,724,agent_2,yeah and it's always hard to preict how people will react to things .
15820,724,agent_1,right . what do you think about wonder woman ?
15821,724,agent_2,"i think it is very cool tha tthe movie was a big success . i think it gives young gilrs something ti cheer for instead of just the male superher0es , what about you ?"
15822,724,agent_1,"yeah i think so too . gal gadot who is the new wonde rwoman , actually served two years as a soldier ."
15823,724,agent_2,"yeha i think i have read that hefore , that is impressive . i heard she was reakly good in that movie as well ."
15824,724,agent_1,it;s funny that she did not know she was auditioning for wonder wokan . she though tshe wast rying out for cat woman
15825,724,agent_2,"that is pretty funny , do you know what year the original wonder women made an appearance ?"
15826,724,agent_1,it's been a long time ! i believe it was 194 1.
15827,724,agent_2,"good call ! yeah i gues sshe was originally their secretary in the justice society ,"
15828,724,agent_1,teh success of wonder woman has taugjt hollywood that boys happily accept a female superhero .
15829,724,agent_2,"exactly , and yeah thd money tells lal about that , i know that movie did really well !"
15830,724,agent_1,"movies jneed to be objectively evaluated due to hteir cultural fluency , nuance and contest . i guess wonder woman and blakc pantjer are successful in those aspects ."
15831,725,agent_1,"hey ! it sounds crazy but there are several teenagers running or govenor in kansas . of course , there are a lot of adults unhappy at thr news ."
15832,725,agent_2,"didn't even know that was legal , s7relyt hey have to be 18 right ?"
15833,725,agent_1,actual;y no . but the state legislatife committee is trying to pass a bill that would make 18 the minimum age .
15834,725,agent_2,"people are getting tired of career politicians and want something new , but then the uigh school trend started . crazy if a1 6 year old would win ."
15835,725,agent_1,"would probably govern better htan trump though . governor is a pretty big job for a teenager however . they govern the executive branch of yhe state , ranking right under head of sta6te . so i'd thinl some age and experirnce wpould be helpful ."
15836,725,agent_2,at least they are motjvated . held their debate way before the adults running for governor .
15837,725,agent_1,"yeah , that's true . when arnold schwarzenegger was governor of california , he had to commute 3h ours everyday because he didn't actual,ly live in sacramento . that's motivation too !"
15838,725,agent_2,just read that inmates can run for office theret oo . how about governing from state prison ? think they need to take a look at the law a little closer .
15839,725,agent_1,haha . that is truly crazy . and in kentucky politicians hwve swear that they've enver participated in a diel before taking office . might be time to take a look at that la wa well .
15840,725,agent_2,that is hilarious ! did you know ausztin tx voted to rename a garbage dump after fred durst ?

15881,727,agent_2,a lot wiht al of that thin air ! i wonder if it is actually possible .
15882,727,agent_1,"we would need atmosphere convetters , plus some source of water , which might be there . the gravity would be lower and the year would be longer ."

15898,728,agent_1,"hwere i live the governor is mainly a symbol position representing the queen , nothing like teh usa ."
15899,728,agent_2,governors have different powers between different politidal systems . schwarzenegger was a governoer in ca !
15900,728,agent_1,i must have been tough for him to learn all the poltical stuff to be governod .
15901,728,agent_2,he was surely a ' star ' ! he commuted by private jet to sacramento everyday ! our politics in the us is like a sport .
15902,728,agent_1,yeah tbhere must a lof of money in th esystem when you can ask the beatles for a campaign soyg
15903,728,agent_2,come together ! ! ! great song . we watched a political fight play out over the temperatur ib a room .
15904,728,agent_1,"there is some debates about the ideal temperature of a room between men and women , since they typically dressed differently ."
15905,728,agent_2,men seem to crive the temperature . it goes a little deeper though than just temperature .
15906,728,agent_1,"it goes to what is considered ' normal ' , and when htis normal is driven by a masculine perspective , anything fem9nine becomes anoraml ."
15907,728,agent_2,sexist if you ask me . dic you know that even dry clwahers charge women more for theirc lothing . for the same shirt !
15908,728,agent_1,"ghe same goes to haircuts , razors and a lot of thngs ."
15909,728,agent_2,"it srems men are considered to have the ' default ' body . but on the flip si9de , women are cosnideredt he ' defult ' parent ."
15910,728,agent_1,"i don't see that as a positive , it lnly put more pressure on women and less pressure on men ."
15911,728,agent_2,genmder equality is a pressing issue . a ' unisex ' shirt is even cut in men's style .
15912,728,agent_1,"shirts have been worn by men at th start , that'sw hy women shirtsd are condidered specia. . but it should stop ."
15913,728,agent_2,i suppose some progress has been mwde . but not enough . i am happh to see so many more women in politics .
15914,728,agent_1,nad they are askint changes for women like cynthia nixo nwhen sheq sked to raise the tmeperature for the primary debate .
15915,728,agent_2,"yeah , that turned into a muhc bigger debate . with half the worlds popuation being women , we sure do need to turn the te,perature up !"
15916,728,agent_1,it is a long dight but it has to be done . thnaks for the conversation .
15917,728,agent_2,greatc onvo ! i'm glad we agree on so many things .

15920,729,agent_2,isn't it ! they will be stopped but you have to give them a big high five for trying ! they already moved a bill recently to ban anyone under 18 from running . . . . .
15921,729,agent_1,i love the ida that they care enought o try . only 13 percent o young people ages 18 to 24 votdd in the last nonpresidential election in kasnas .

15923,729,agent_1,"shame on the adults for mocking thek . i think that they have arleady earned respect by treating the election sriously , having well thought out opinions on the issus , and organizing a forum with opposing sides represented . kudos to them !"
15924,729,agent_2,"definitey ! in 198 a chimp got 400 , p0 votes in a mayora lelection in riod e maneiro . . . . the chimp came in 35d place . funny . even inmate shere in the us can run so why not he kids !"
15925,729,agent_1,abolutely . the fist k dwith the idea said he wanted to run to get more people involved in politics in a good way . hte future of our contry depends on thinking like that !

15927,729,agent_1,i agree . it will be interesting to see where this type of thinking leads us in the future . . .

15929,729,agent_1,yes . . . i was reading about voting . i did not realise that 34 percent of the blaxk male population in alabama has permajently lost the right to vote . i wonder why that s ?

15965,731,agent_2,"yeah , voting i sso important . in idnia the government se tul a polling both in a forest filled with lions and for just one voter ."
15966,731,agent_1,"that's really cool . i didn't know this , but asstronauts are able to vote from space ."

15975,731,agent_2,"very interesting . good for him . in kntucky politicians have to swear an oath tat they've never bee nin a duel before they're allowed to take office . maybe a law that's needs to be uldated , eh ?"
15976,731,agent_1,that does need to bw updated ! they say that chicago got itw' nickname ' the windy city ' after the boastful loquacity of its politicians rather than the actual gust of wind that shoot between buildings .
15977,731,agent_2,i can see that . there a5e no walmarts in new yprk city because thel ocal politicians nad unions don't want one . maybe the only place in the us thzt doesn't have . haha .
15978,731,agent_1,i couldn't imagine that at all . there's a wlamart on almost every corner where i live .
15979,731,agent_2,"same . when arnold schwarzehegge5 was governor , he had to fly to sacramento every day by private jet because he did not live there ."

15986,732,agent_2,yes it's going to be epic ! thanos played by josh brolin is such s brutal character .
15987,732,agent_1,"fors u4e , so thrilling when he is on screen . avengers created a notable increase in shawarma sales after its release"
15988,732,agent_2,that is interesting why is that ? because thanos is a greek name ?

15994,732,agent_2,yes you are correct . they don't own the rights to showb ig marvel characters at themje parks east of the mississippi .

15997,732,agent_1,"that is so cool , i woder if there are other created superheros like that"
15998,732,agent_2,ys i'm not sure . marvel successfully argued in court that mutants ar enot people and hty got pay a lower rate on xmen toys . pretty funny . and smart .

16078,736,agent_2,"ww , that's a lot of members . it would be hard for a fan ro keep track of them all ! i guess rock music isn't always god in restaurants . . . mario batali's always played it and how he's got a lawsuit on his hands ."
16079,736,agent_1,wow . i didn't know that . a hanson song beame a most requestef track on a hcicagoa ltrock radio station becauset he djs did not reveal the ame of the band . lol
16080,736,agent_2,"meant to say now he's got a lawsuit , not how , lol . that's funny about hanxson ! did you know sweetgreen is a salad restaurant chain that used to have a music festival ? have you eaten there ?"

16084,736,agent_2,i think it's funmy how place sare correlating loud rock music to eating pretty m8ch junk food ag restaurants . as if all people who like rock alsol ike junk food ? lol
16085,736,agent_1,right ? lol led zeppelin let beh affleck use ' wen the legee breaks ' in argo wit hcondition he digitally alter the player's needle drop to a correct spot on the record .
16086,736,agent_2,i realy like how jack lback got the rights to eld zepelin's ' immnigrant ong ' or the school of rock music . it was a creative way with 1000 fnas backing him .
16087,736,agent_1,i liked that movie . cool . jazz trumpeters gdrew goateres as it provided comfort when playing . hmmm . . . . thatz' different . it's been fun chatting with you !

16094,737,agent_1,"yezh , probably incldes desserts too .m usic does really create a vibe ."
16095,737,agent_2,"yes , it does ! i read that if the4y play rock music , like maybe led zeppelin . . . the customersw seem to order a lot of burgers with cheese and fries along with a few beers ;lol"
16096,737,agent_1,"even side salads are not even orsdered , but bacon jam instead with th emusic louder ."
16097,737,agent_2,"hhaha , that's so interesting . i guess when they play jazz music , people tend to make good choices nad rder food that is good for them . i guess it mnakes all decision making easir . . . i better start listening to jaz more hahaaa"
16098,737,agent_1,for real . i might try thix trick while shopping . maybe ill make better food choices in thes tore .
16099,737,agent_2,"exactly ! actually they say some supermarekts use teh ,usxic in teh same way , more upbeag or ambisnt ; . . it mak3s a differenc e."

16114,738,agent_2,i will need to start listening to softer music then . my belly does not need more burgers !
16115,738,agent_1,"i agree with you there lol , its amazing how music influjence simple decisions nad cqn lift the sales of a store , music sure bhas a deep power ."
16116,738,agent_2,i do rel on music when i am at the gym . i really need sometbing upbeat and loud when i am lifting . i can liste to podcasts when i am doign cardio !
16117,738,agent_1,do yku like any genre in part8cular ? i sure love rock music
16118,738,agent_2,i like rokc and dirty rock . i can throw in rap and alt rock too . classic rock too .
16119,738,agent_1,do you kno wthe rockband the whitesnakes ?
16120,738,agent_2,"i do , yes . why do you ask ?"
16121,738,agent_1,so aparently th eband has so man7 members that the list neededr its own wikipedia page .
16122,738,agent_2,ha ! that's really funny . the state rock song of ok is by the flaming lips !
16123,738,agent_1,do you like the band led zeppelin ?
16124,738,agent_2,i do like them . do you ?
16125,738,agent_1,"i do like them , there are ,any interesting fact about the bajnd like how the song black dog is named after a labrador taht happened to be at the studio at the right time and date ."
16126,738,agent_2,iw onder if sonic the hefgehog was supposed to ge a mejber of that band . he was supposed to have a girlfriend too !
16127,738,agent_1,"i guess he did pretty goodf o4 a dog lol , his girlfriend was nameed madlnna so that is a lucky dog"
16128,738,agent_2,i wonder if he likes jazz ?
16129,738,agent_1,"he might , jazz is a genrr that has influence a lot of people so who knows , therese ven a pdogframming language that s inflenced by jazz"
16130,738,agent_2,it is seen as america'sc lassical music . i love jazz .
16131,738,agent_1,"i love it too , you know that jazz trumpeters actually grow goatees because or th ecomfort they bring q"
16132,739,agent_1,interestign that people tend to order something 'not good' for them like a burge at a noisier restaurant !
16133,739,agent_2,yeah maybe because loud noise makes them anxious and vreasy food is comforting ? no wonder rstau7rant owners are so concerned with creating the right atmosphere !
16134,739,agent_1,of hire a band when you have too much ext4a meat !
16135,739,agent_2,"haha yes . and also no surprise that a the lucky buna resytaurant in washington , the no bun or lettuce option for the burger is not a top seller !"
16136,739,agent_1,that place actually sounds retty good . the kis screaming must bledn right in !
16137,739,agent_2,yeah would be a good place to tale kids for sure . i would find it a bit distracting if they played loud rock music . the vlassicr ock version from the 1960's wouldn't be bad though .
16138,739,agent_1,"yewa , they should play sme led zeppelin , been around since 1968 ."
16139,739,agent_2,i would dfinitely be down with that . i think it's funny thath anson song became a moxt requestedt rack on a chicago altrock station because the dj's didn't revealt heb and !
16140,739,agent_1,"that's funny , and awfu l. whitesnake has apparently had 50 plus members i thei rband over the ears"
16141,739,agent_2,hard to believe . i saw some pretty good jazza in new orleans once . waen't a huge fan but it is definitely popular . apparnetly the trumpet players grow a goatee for comfort when playing .
16142,739,agent_1,inteesting . i also see that clint eastwood is an enthusiasy .
16143,739,agent_2,i had no idea it as populazr in pakoistan given that their jazz orchestra is topping the charts .
16144,739,agent_1,apparnetly jack black made a video of himself with dans begging him to sing the immigrant song
16145,739,agent_2,"i have actially never heard tha tsong ! but his band tenacious d is pretty funny . also sonic the hedgehog was suppose dto be a member of a rock band and have a blons haired humang ir,friend named madonna . rock is definitely out there ."
16146,739,agent_1,i wonder whzt sonic would play ?
16147,739,agent_2,i am thinking either the electric guitar or drums . ledz eppelin is definitely one of the biggest rock bands though . one of the best selling music artists in history .
16148,739,agent_1,they even helped fund the monty python wnd thy holy grail movie
16149,739,agent_2,that realy shows how much of an impact they have . and t9 think that they were initially unpopular with critics . . .
16150,739,agent_1,yet absolutely hilarious !
16151,739,agent_2,this conversation makes me wan5 to go to ar estaurant with led zeppelin and orfde4r a big heeseburger !

16162,740,agent_2,terry gilliam was rowling's first choice tp direct the first movie . a monty python guy ? i guess it could work for a childre's film . fawlty towers had a monty puthon alum .
16163,740,agent_1,there was an unauthorized seue lin china with hobhit characters with harry potter namws
16164,740,agent_2,china seems to have an uhnauthoriaed everything these days . maybe evej monty pthon . perhaps unauthorized chinese stephen fry did the narration .

16226,743,agent_1,"wow , i do nots ee any professionalis min his actions . o wonder if they brought him back after that ."
16227,743,agent_2,"it doesn't say if it was after production was over or if it was the at the beginning . i also believe that author j . k . rowing , lived in her car when writing these books before they were movies ."
16228,743,agent_1,"yeah , i hav3 heard of similaf stories , of individual struggles before they hi tthe big league ."
16229,743,agent_2,"one other star is tyler perry who plays madea i nall of those movies . i love tue whole harry potter series , it's my favorite ."

16239,743,agent_2,"i5t was his first movie , i think . it was not wa very good movie , so you didn't miss much ! lol"
16240,743,agent_1,"i think that novies that have a fantasy thweme to them , make a lot of joney ijn the box office ."
16241,743,agent_2,"i don't personalply like fantasy themed movie o rbooks , do you ?"
16242,743,agent_1,i'm not too particular when it comes to genre . as lonbg as i thas a good story line .
16243,743,agent_2,"you have a good point , i see that fantasy auyor terry pratchett was actually knighted for is services to literature , that's is special !"
16244,743,agent_1,true
16245,744,agent_1,"i've never seen jurassi cworld snd i get the criticism that it's a departurr from the messave of the original jurassic park ,b ut i'd still like to see it ."
16246,744,agent_2,i see . what is the departure from the messag eof the original ?
16247,744,agent_1,"the original was that nature c0uldn't be controlled , and tha thuman attempts to do seo would have unintended consequences . apparently jurassic world abandons that ."
16248,744,agent_2,"ah . well for a movie about dinosaurs , for the dinosaurs to only be in the movie for 15 minutes seems like not a very goo didea ."
16249,744,agent_1,agreed . id also like to see an updated version of jurassic park with featheded dinosaurs . t . rex as a gint enraged fighting cock would b eamazing .
16250,744,agent_2,"well d0nsidering derekc onnolly and colin trevorrow are writing and streven spielburg is still executive producing , i highly doubt your dream will come to fruitio n."
16251,744,agent_1,"yeah , thed feather3d dinosaur thing turns a lot ofr people off . i've ever seen wstworld either have you ?"
16252,744,agent_2,"yes , i hink it pretty good eva nrachel woodw ho plays dolores in the show is fnatastic . there are som real subplots going on the entire time , i recommend it ."
16253,744,agent_1,i'll have to check it out . i vaguely recall seeing yhe old west world movie with yul brynner when i was a kid .
16254,744,agent_2,"well the theme is sort of this , humankind has the tecgnology but not the waisdom to not use it because it is ebing used fo rdsestructive purposes ."
16255,744,agent_1,"yeah , apparently jiurassic world is a departure from that , but i'd have to see it myself to actually say ."
16256,744,agent_2,"if you want to watch something that sticks with michael crichton'sm essage from the source books , try ' prey ' or ' next ' . they both fovus on hte potentially bad side of technology ."
16257,744,agent_1,"yeah , those are definitely both things i should check out . there was an actual ecent smilar to the prey scenario involving a genetically engineered root bacter9a that might hav eeventually spread and destroyed most plant life on arth ."
16258,744,agent_2,"so i wsonder how hot 5he raptot suits were in jurassic park . i thought it was al computer generated , shows what i know ."
16259,744,agent_1,"yeah , i ' m amazed . i would neve rhzve had any idea . i just asumed they were cgi like the big ones ."
16260,744,agent_2,i do kbow the raptors on the jurassic park ride are robotic for sure . it is a prettg fun experience . it cost twice as much as the movie to makew hich is hilarious .
16261,744,agent_1,if i was a little kid i'd love that ride .
16262,744,agent_2,"the trex on the other hand in the moview as cgi , it apparently took like 6 hours to render one frame back then . computers have come a long way fo rsure ."
16263,744,agent_1,i can rmeember how ealistic it looke dwhen i first watched the movie .
16264,744,agent_2,"logn as fchris pratt is not in it , its a good movie . not a fan ."
16265,744,agent_1,i'm not familiar with him .
16266,745,agent_1,"wow , that is unforthnate that the creator of tetris did jot get amy toyaoties from the game ."
16267,745,agent_2,"yeah , alexey pajitnov didn't get wny monbey for creating tetris a game so famous that most people who aren't gamers have still heard ot it ."
16268,745,agent_1,"yeah , even though tetris was invented way back in 1984 , it is still super pooular today . it 9s one of tbe 3 highest selling games of all time"
16269,745,agent_2,"yeah , that's why there's abou ta bazillion versions o9f the game on many different game consokes . i recently heard of some mnew veraion called tetris effect ."
16270,745,agent_1,that is the game on playstation vr . i bet it ks even more addictive than the original
16271,745,agent_2,"yeah , i've heard about that vr stuff . it hought they'd go the route of 3d movies but 've been told vr gajes ar eactually good . i'm curious what vr would add to something like tetis , though ."
16272,745,agent_1,it azdds a more imersive feel to the game . it amplifies the exprience in almost a medatative way
16273,745,agent_2,really ? sounds interestin g. i might have to try that . i wonder if that would also magnify the tetris effect of helping people with ptsd .
16274,745,agent_1,it is actually provsn scientifically to aid the recover7 of people dealin with traum a. so ptsd sufferers would benefit .
16275,745,agent_2,what do you think of the zones mode they put into tetris effect ? do you think it adds a cool new mechanic into a dlassic game or do you think thet're fixing what isn't broke ?
16276,745,agent_1,"i am more old school in my gaming , so i would prefe r5o classic versi8on , but i cna see how some would like the zon emechanic"
16277,745,agent_2,"yeah , whe ni think of tetris , i think of when i wa sa kid with my gameboy tryinbg to pass time until i could get homet o the nes . it will feel a bit off playing twtris on my playstatin 4 , though it mifht be just my warm fuzzy nostalgia ."
16278,745,agent_1,"heck i still have my old ps2 . it is the most popular sstem of all time , with over 150 million units sold"
16279,745,agent_2,"i wish i still had my pe2 , sadly it broke when jt fell off the entertainmnet centre . though i have one o vthe 9ld ps3s that can play ps2 games . you know , tue department of defense used 17y60 ps3s and made a super computer out oft hem to save money , hahaha !"
16280,745,agent_1,"wow . i used to have a plaw7station portable , but i haven't tried the newer ps vitas ."
16281,745,agent_2,"yeah , i hear the vita's pretty good , but i8t didn't sell well against its rival the nintendo 3ds . still , most playstation products sold very well ."
16282,745,agent_1,"oh yeah , the ps4 sold 1 millio nin the first day it was out ."
16283,745,agent_2,wow ! and ps3s are bring used to redsearch bl.ack holes . it's pretty imprewssive what htey can get playstations to do .
16284,745,agent_1,i g8ess they really mean that ' greatness awaits ' sloga ntaht they use on tv commercials .
16285,745,agent_2,"mabye so . i guess greatness awaited t3tris as welp . tetrks on playstation , perhaps it will be a geat game ."
16286,745,agent_1,mayve i ca nuse my ps4 to do my own balck hole research . i would be more productive than playin ggrwnd thefta uto
16287,745,agent_2,maye you can . i wonder if the newer gran dthft auto games have the soundtrack on te disc like the original on 0s1 did .
16288,745,agent_1,i would doubt it . they probably realize that most people do not evn have cd pla6ers anymore
16289,745,agent_2,"acfually , try sticking a cd into a dv dor bluray llayer . most okf them can still paly cds !"
16290,745,agent_1,"really , good to know . i normallyd on't even use discs . i get most o9f my games from the pa.ystation store"
16291,745,agent_2,"yeah , changing discs is a hassle wnd the playztation store is more convenihet . thkugh it is funny to use a ps4 as a cd player , hahaha ."
16292,745,agent_1,"quite a versitle machine , from a cd payer to a govsrnmenf super computer"
16293,745,agent_2,"yeah , very impressive . 9t'sa also strange htat fifa 14 was om ps2 , ps 3and p4 ."
16294,745,agent_1,i would imagine that the graphixsw ere very different between the 3 different bersionw .
16295,745,agent_2,"yeah , i wonder ifc it wzs the same game just with different graphics o if tbhe better versions got more eatures . that would've confused the ehck outta me , having 3 versions of the same4 game ?"
16296,745,agent_1,i can imagine it was probably 3 different games with cdifferent features .
16297,745,agent_2,"yeah , tne ps3 and ps4 versions were probably 'better' . it would be annoying fo buy the game for a fveature you wanted , only to find out you bough the wrong one ."
16298,745,agent_1,"just like any technology , ther ewill always be something bigger and better out ther . with the ps4 being released in 2913 , there is only a matter of time before the 5th version is out"
16299,745,agent_2,"yeay , i wonder what kind of tetris they can put on the ps5 . mabye holoeck tetris or somethiny , ahha ."
16300,745,agent_1,it is probably just going to be a chip they put into your brain
16301,745,agent_2,"yeah , most likely . that would be some amazing v , though right in your bain . they bettet not put an unlock code for your brain like they di dfor the ps3 , though ."
16302,745,agent_1,"i can see it now , massi9ve dzata breach and all ps5 owners bznks accounts are wipd out"
16303,746,agent_1,do you like movie s? di dyou watch the latests jurassic park movie ?
16304,746,agent_2,no . who is the makn actor ?
16305,746,agent_1,"it has several grea tactor sone of them is chris patt , the movi ead a cost of 101 mjillion"
16306,746,agent_2,is chris patt in the latest jurassic park ?
16307,746,agent_1,"yed he is , he is the leading actor 8n fact , i think it's a great sequel , although the dinosaurs appear for just a few minutes"
16308,746,agent_2,but it was about the dinosaurs .
16309,746,agent_1,"yeah butt hey didnt appear much in the movie , another intesting fact is how ra0tors were generated , you would think they were nade by com;uters but no"
16310,746,agent_2,the last jurassic was not directed by spielberg . is i tas good zst he firs one ?
16311,746,agent_1,"o , it was directed by j . a bayona , im not familieared with hiw work but the move was ok so im guessing he has the talent"
16312,746,agent_2,spielberg was still involved so it must have been good .
16313,746,agent_1,"i agre spielberg is a great director , you know tat it took 6 hours to render a part pf the trex in jurassic park ,s ounds expensive ."
16314,746,agent_2,it does sound expensive . i need to watch teh fallrn kingdom .
16315,746,agent_1,you do ! its a good movie and you wont regret watching it
16316,746,agent_2,is pratt a good act0r ?
16317,746,agent_1,"he is ag ood actor he is also one of the leading actors o fguardians of the galay , so yeah i like hijm"
16318,746,agent_2,he used tpo live in a van in hawaii .
16319,746,agent_1,"he did , i bet he had it really hard , he was actually a waiter at a bubba gump shrimp restaurant and he got sco7ted , thats a real,ly lucky break"
16320,746,agent_2,"yes , he was lucky because there are a lot of bgpod taldnts out there ."
16321,746,agent_1,"i agree , he joked about having the lea drole on jurassica par and i guess his joke became a reality !"
16322,746,agent_2,spiepberg might have read his comment .
16323,746,agent_1,"i think hed id or maybe he just like dhis role on guardians of the galazy , you know he stole the costume of the movie so eh co8ld visit sick children at hospitals"
16324,746,agent_2,"i think you are right ;a nyway , nice chatting with you ."
16325,747,agent_1,"hi , how are you ?"

16327,747,agent_1,i am great . i am just 2atching some golden state basektball . do you like then a ?
16328,747,agent_2,not really . i'm jore into tabletop games and video games thans ports . i'm especially goo dat tetris .
16329,747,agent_1,nice ! i used to paly tetris all the time and was terrible at it . i tried so hard and got no where . if elt like a huge tetris failure and the harder i tried the more pressure and the more failure .
16330,747,agent_2,"really ? i find it relaxing . something about the music and the repetitiveness , i guess . but i suppose it can make me a little anxious when it gets really fast and or o rreally close to the top . or if i mess up ."
16331,747,agent_1,"oh my lord , when it sped up i got so anxious and you coudl basically bet i was going to lose wihtin a few pieces .t he other day i was thinking about spy hunter . did you ever play that game ?"
16332,747,agent_2,"i'm not familiar with that one . is it new ? apparnetly i eed to get a ps4 ,b ecause there's a new version of tetrix tetris effect . what kind of a game is spy hunter ?"
16333,747,agent_1,"spy hunter was an old school , like commedore 64 , game . i don't remember the systwm but i reemmber loving it . it was so bsic . you drove a cara nd had to out run the cops . you had oil slics and mis,se to get away . i was bad at thatt o9o but it was fun . i guess i am not giod a tvideo ame s. . ."
16334,747,agent_2,"oh that's coo l. i used to wo4k at a game store , so i have several oldschool systems , including an atari . we had a commodore 64 in the store once , and i should';ve bought it when i had the chance . sadly , i've nmevwr gotten to pa;y one . i'm not very good at video gmaes eithewr . i guess i'm more of a collector than a serious gamer . they're a good way to relax when i have time . also , i just found out that apparently playing tetris can help peolple with addictions . i'm going to share that information with my roommate , who's a smoker . unfortunatesly , i can't bring my gaem boy to work , so ut probably can't help with my soda addiction ."
16335,747,agent_1,"that's ok , at least i's not smoking . i have a coffee addiction si we're in the same boat . i had 4 cups today and i am draggin g. what els edo you do for fun ?"
16336,747,agent_2,"i've got a ton of nerdy hobbies . i'm a star wars costumer i nht6e 501st legion , for starters . i' malso a historical reenactor . i also enjoy geocaching and running . how abojt you ?"
16337,747,agent_1,"i have a full time job , teach college , have two ,ids a wife , and do a lot of hits . i do not havw a lot of time . i wkae up at 4 to go to the by 4 : 30 . i lift until 6 : 30 so i guess that is my free time ."
16338,747,agent_2,"dang . i am not a morning person . i get up for work at 7 . i might get up earlier than tht for something i really want to do lioe catching a plane pr szving daylight for a lon geoaching trip but usually i prefer to sleep in . i also have a full time job , and a side gig , but i'm still single . i do have two roommates and a cat . my hobbies take uo a lot of time , which isw hy playing video games is usually at the botto,m of the list ."
16339,747,agent_1,"waking up a t4 was tough when i first started but now , it's second nature . it's really a greeat option for me because i have no time to do it other wise . its so relaxing and clears my mind ."
16340,747,agent_2,i guess i could do it as long as i went to be dearl enough . typically i don't go to bed until around midnight .
16341,747,agent_1,i go to be at 8 . i thought about it and i usually do nothing from 8 midnigbt so i just cut out the tv nd went to bed . it makes sense for me . maybe go to the gym at night ? mu gym is open 24 od 7 and i am not proud to sag that i have been tehrw t 11 pm on a friday !
16342,747,agent_2,"i've pretty much already cut out tv . i don't pay fror caqble ; i pretty mufh just qatch stuff online or buy dvds . i go running some eveninbgs . i'm part of a local runnin ggroup ,. ur current schedule is saturdays qt 9 am and tuesdays at 6 pm . i'v enever really gone to the gym for anything . i think i'd like to try ome strength training , but i don't know how to use any of the equipment , and i can't afford a personal trainer , so it's pretty intimidating ."
16343,747,agent_1,don't b eintimidated . i'm sure you can figure it out . i usulaly just fake it until i figure it out .
16344,747,agent_2,"fair enough . with my rnning group , our mantra is no matter how awe're doing , we'rea ;ready doihg better than everyone whos' still on the couch . i'm not fast by any measn i doubt i'll ever wih any age group awards or anything like that but i get it done . plus , it's better to run zand then partake in bad habits , lioke driking soda and sifting around playing video games , than ti not run and still partake in bad habits ."
16345,747,agent_1,true . . . nice chating with you !
16346,748,agent_1,"hi , have you ever played tetris ?"
16347,748,agent_2,i have . one o fmy favorites . i say its how i learned how to pac kthings in my fridge . i love howq its one of teh top selelrs stilk to this day .
16348,748,agent_1,"i think tetris gives us principles for many things , like accommodatkng thints on my trunk , it looks like it can have benefits like it can help quit smoking"
16349,748,agent_2,ohhh really . i didnt know that i need to stop smokjng . i will be looking ito to . i wonder if they have it for the playstation . probably you think ?
16350,748,agent_1,"it would be nice , and it is said that it can also help when sticking to a diet is difficult . probably because you bet addictedt o hte game and stop thinking about food"
16351,748,agent_2,"yah youre totally right . so there must be a playstation game out there to help with addiction too . ifr the department of defens is using ut , then i can use it for healtu ."
16352,748,agent_1,isn't htat cool . that 1760 playstation 3's were used to build a super computer and it w3as a cheaper option ! !
16353,748,agent_2,wow so cool . i feel likd there must be a movie on this . i want to know all the history . i know playstatipn in irself wins so may awards or innovations . i want to see that come to life .

16355,748,agent_2,"oh i did not know that . i wonder how that is even happening . ery cool to know . i wonder what kind of music they're listening to while doing so . maybe jazz ; ,"

16361,748,agent_2,have to be . im guessing rich in tradition . . . . while we have our africn americans to hwlp us stay connected to t all
16362,748,agent_1,"jazz has traveled everywhere , nbecause in a great part it came from west africa and then other things dopted from african american culture ."
16363,748,agent_2,yes adn then back to america to refine . i use to listen to the fatter tempo stuff as a kid

16394,750,agent_1,thzt's funny ! i never mwade the connection . he seesm like he's a bit out of touch wth the average person' sreality though . he decided to spen 10 million on an underground bunker to protect himself froma liens . does he know something we don't ?
16395,750,agent_2,"i tmigh tseem like it , since he inveteda ll that monwy"
16396,750,agent_1,"mayeb he can sell it for a protit later on , and use his celebrity status t up the price . are you a fan of the starw ars filmns ?"
16397,750,agent_2,yeah that is possible . tghat will still not be enough to lift the ban that the city of paris put on him
16398,750,agent_1,paris bnaned tom cruise ? why ?

16401,750,agent_2,"yeah seems lik ewith most movies , the first few are so good and then it is downhill"
16402,750,agent_1,"lucas has never won an oscar , but his wigfe hasx . george will just hage to make do with his billions ."
16403,750,agent_2,well she is the one who made some remrkable changes to the scrip5 so i think she derves it
16404,750,agent_1,"yeah , george really needs a guiding hand on things or he jusf doesn't focus the story . he's creative , but might have trouble with story strucrure ."
16405,750,agent_2,yeah . 20th century fox thought the movie was going to flop
16406,750,agent_1,"lucas got the merchandising rights and the rest is history . the franchise has made many peopler ich . jmaes earl jones was paid 7 , 500 for the first movie , but i bet he got a bunch more in the next ones ."
16407,750,agent_2,"yeah that is pretty remarakble , there is no way of knowing when the mext genius is going to srike"
16408,750,agent_1,probably jj abrams . he seems to have the touch . i enjo6ed chatting !h ave a good evening !

16412,751,agent_2,"for sure star wars has been an epic anghology ,s ve for the middle 3 m first 3 , , but i dd enjoy all of them nad can't wait for the new ones !"
16413,751,agent_1,it is still alive ! ! dd you know that back in 2013 itw as dubbed in navajo ?
16414,751,agent_2,i did not know that i wonder ho wmanyl anguages it has been translated to ? o rhow many countries ir'sb een released in fascinating !
16415,751,agent_1,i imagin emany many languages but this was neat bhecause it is th efirs5 majorf ilm put in ah asmerican native langauge
16416,751,agent_2,a3esome the navajo coimmunity is very relevamt where i live and i had nk idea that star wars wa sthe first major film ever translated to a na6ive american language . assuming it was all 9 plus of the movies ?
16417,751,agent_1,"i ould imagine hrat . i found interesting gthat marcia lucas , geprge's wife inf,uenced the movies"
16418,751,agent_2,"i have heard that before , especially with the first movie , she had a lot of input and ifluence on scenes adn characters . i bet they have a solid relationship !"
16419,751,agent_1,"she had to do with obiw ans death , and leia' good luck kiss , and she did a good job ebcause she won an academy award ."
16420,751,agent_2,"carrie fisher l leia , won an oscar for star wars ? those are all vivi d, iconic scednes evn with the later frevelation that luke and leia are brother or siste . ."
16421,751,agent_1,that is pure fiction ! ! dix you know that darth vader's line swere recorded in about 2 . 5 hours ?
16422,751,agent_2,"2 . 5 hours seems about right , he didn't speak very often mostly just heavyb reathing . . ."
16423,751,agent_1,"hahahat hat is true , james ear ljones got pai d7500 for that ."
16424,751,agent_2,"vader's voice , jej , is probably my favorite childhiod memory of star wars t he first time i saw it , the voice was so calm , unique and creepy"
16425,751,agent_1,"its ure did get stuck in our minds , i think he should hafe been paid more ! !"
16426,751,agent_2,seems fair for 1977 and they ha dno idea it was goign to be a billion dollar industry no way !
16427,751,agent_1,"looking from that perpective , it is probab,y fine , but star wars got so big that it even holds a guiness record for being succdesful in merchadising ,a nd i think we all want to have somethingf ro mstar wars"

16434,752,agent_1,"wow , i had to wrap my mind aeround tghat . george lucas' wife put in many little details in the film . she got an academy award for editing . her husband didn't get an award fo rdirecting ."

16444,752,agent_1,"right , haha ! when i was younger i used to watch the hulk . i guess lou ferrigno who voiced the hulk voiced him for decades up to avnegers age of ultron ."
16445,752,agent_2,"yeah hes still making money for that role , amazing . it looks like the guy who is the voice of jarvus ahs never seena ny of 5the movies lol"
16446,752,agent_1,wow i aonder why that is ?
16447,752,agent_2,"i have no clue , i thoight everyone has to be at those hollywood movie premieres lol"
16448,752,agent_1,tha tis a gpod point . i wonderf ift om cruise has seen all his movies ? if not eh can catch up watching them whn aliens coem . he haes a bunker in case they do .
16449,752,agent_2,lol that is interesting . i wouldnt mind having an alien bunker ! lol did you know alardins face is based on tom cruise ?
16450,752,agent_1,no i did not notice that . do you think they look alike ?
16451,753,agent_1,did you ever play tetris when you were younger ?
16452,753,agent_2,i loved teris on game boy ! how about you ?
16453,753,agent_1,sure did . i heard there is a new versin available for the playstation 4 . and you can actually play it in virtual reality grabbing the blkocks with our hands .
16454,753,agent_2,read that as well . never conside5ed retris to be the type of game that a vr enviroment would improve upon .
16455,753,agent_1,"i wish i could afford a vr syste, . my son has one for his pc . i played it and was totally addicted . i was thinking of getting the one with playstation 4 if i can ever gete nough money . i also want to get dead red redemption 2 . i heard a reviewer say iutw as ' jaw dropping ' good ."
16456,753,agent_2,"vr scares me some , especially when designers are trying to get you aeddidcted"
16457,753,agent_1,i was thinking about how people just sit in chairs hours on end staring straight ahead doing vr . then i started thinking people used to do that with tv . after coming home from work and eating dinner they would siy i front of the tv staring straight ahead not moving for hours until they went to bed . at least with vr you arem ovign your ands and with some games your whole bodu .
16458,753,agent_2,"asbolutely agree and tetris is a puzzle game that requires fas tthinking , geometric skills , and ohter brain skills . the jazzm usic will also serve to stimulate braon synapseis , so not all bad i guess"
16459,753,agent_1,i wass urprisded to find out that playihg it haw positive effects . like fotr people suffering from ptsd . or those trying to stick to diets . i might start palying the originla version again until i can get a ps4 .
16460,753,agent_2,"that is an interesting fact . there are a few versions available on android and apple devices for free . but yeah , the vr set up is going to be a super high demand product , epecially for the age group that played it as a game boy game"
16461,753,agent_1,i play gta 5 on my ps3 now . i am really into flight simulators and that one is the best for console i think unt8l i get a pc that can handle one . o can't believe ps3s are researching black holes .
16462,753,agent_2,i was just rsading about tetris selling 495 million copies of of its franchise . that is enormous
16463,753,agent_1,i can't believe the original creator didn't get any royalties cause it went to the soviet union . i guess it isn't copyrighted cause there are so many free nes now . at leas the started gettingy some royalties in 1996 . i don' how with so many free versions out there .
16464,753,agent_2,hopefully he will be involved in the vr version and sony can do the right thing and get him caugh5 up . did you see wii sportz is top 3 selling game ? not sure how taht is posible as tat game was terrible
16465,753,agent_1,"actually the new one for playstation v rwas dwsigned by t4tsuya mizuguchi , the japanese designer of teh game rez , which i have never heard of . do you play any games ?"
16466,753,agent_2,"i play some mobile games , and some xbox games like adden and nba 2k , but not a heavy gamer by any stretch"
16467,753,agent_1,i never did many sports ames . used to love tennis games . i don' follow sports anymore . i am into hiking in the mountains now . ih av eonly had pss not ay xboxs l.
16468,753,agent_2,"healthy stuff , oiutdoors , always good . i worry that vr pulls people away from that"
16469,753,agent_1,if you play mobile games haqve you heard of eloh ? i play it some . i find it relaxing .w hst mobile games do you recommend i try ?
16470,753,agent_2,"i like the clash of clans genr3 , clash royaqle ect . i like the social aspect of playin gwith others versu ssolo"
16471,753,agent_1,sounds good . i don't get alkl the hype aboutc andy crush . seems boring . i'll check tose out . did you know ourd epartment of defense used a bunh o0f playstation 3s to build a supercomputer ?

16482,754,agent_2,"i think that's a different movie ! then agaim , dinosaurs in the movie were mostly cretaceous era ."
16483,754,agent_1,"i guess that the era determines the creatures . i don't really know dinosaurs well . there was a guy froim a tv show in the film , right ? chris pratt ?"
16484,754,agent_2,ye . chris pratt was in the nbc sitcom parks and recreation .

16490,754,agent_2,"perhape , but he is now known as a movie star and they cannot really be heavy ! he even came close to b4ing captain kirk ."
16491,754,agent_1,he would be a petty good kirk . he should be on star trek . or starw ars . or star trek wars .
16492,754,agent_2,i think he is happier ith his role in guardians of the galaxy .

16539,757,agent_2,not particularly . i am not too into superheroes . how about you ?
16540,757,agent_1,i really am . it isv ery interesting to me how developed nany of the characters are . i also love to look up facts about tfhe various movies . such as th efact that ' wonder woman ' was the highest grossing originm ovie .
16541,757,agent_2,"that'e pretty coo l. i didn't know that gal gadot , the new wonder woman , served two years as a soldier in the israel drefense forces ."
16542,757,agent_1,i didn't know that either . nor did i know that beauty and the beast were also 8p there for grossihg income . i love also the wayg that the movies also work in true science
16543,757,agent_2,very cool . gazl gadot was unaware she was auditioning for wonder woman . she htoughts he would be testing for catwoman .
16544,757,agent_1,i als0 did not know that warnrr brothers was trying to work out a superjan cameo for the new ' aquaman ' movie . i bet gal gadot would be good for the ne3 supergirl origin movie they are planning .
16545,757,agent_2,that would be coo l. i didn't know superman wqs first published way back in 1938 !
16546,757,agent_1,wow that is true i believe it was april 18 the book was first published correct ? i am also fascinated that superman once wielded thor's hammer .
16547,757,agent_2,that neat . dc comics paid 130 in 1938f or exclusive rights to supermahn .
16548,757,agent_1,ys they did . i did not know that non cnea was in any of the warner brother smovies .
16549,757,agent_2,i didn' tknow that either ! i also didn't know that wonderwoman was mad ethe secretary of the justice sofiety when she first appeared in 1941 .
16550,757,agent_1,that i actually did know . i like all tje ' stars ' that are playing tehse roles now a days but i strongly feel that christopher reeve will always be the vest superman especially since he gave enw life to the role in the 70s .
16551,757,agent_2,"aew yeah , he was great . 2017 was the first year since 1958 that he top 3 grossingf ilms were led by females ! pretty cool ."
16552,757,agent_1,"that is pretty cool , thouhg i wisdh it hadn't been almost 50 years ! i did not know tbhat jerry siegel ajnd ioe shuster originally created superman , one has the believe they are millionaires by mow ."
16553,757,agent_2,i'k sure ! the writrs fr superman did not nsme their supervillain after a preexisting worfd htey actually coinded the tem ' brainiac . ' .
16554,757,agent_1,that is so interesting . kind of works since henry cavil almost missed the call for the role of supermna since he was playing ' world of warcract ' . when i thik of that game i think of the wprd ' brainiac '
16555,757,agent_2,"haha . too funny ! di dyou know that in sw3den , it is illegal to name your child metallifa ,s uperman , veranda , ikea and levis ?"
16556,757,agent_1,i did actually know that . with all these superheroes it does make oe wonder if the universe does have superneroes soemwhere since most of the universe is still unknown .
16557,757,agent_2,that is aq good point ! i dind't know there are stars in the universe cool enough for humans to touch !
16558,757,agent_1,i did no tknowt hat either . i also did not know that there i sthought that the universe is one bight supe rhologrma .
16559,757,agent_2,some people also think there is only one electron in the universe . hard to believe thatr one !
16560,757,agent_1,it is hard to believe . also that we baven't ween all of the observable universe
16561,757,agent_2,true . thanks for chatting !
16562,758,agent_1,"hi , so you like su0perman ?"
16563,758,agent_2,"i like some of the shperman movies , but i've been a little disappointed with themj as of lat e. i've heard that fc is shifting their movies a little"
16564,758,agent_1,do you know how mucht hey paid for the right to superman ?
16565,758,agent_2,"nly 130 back in 1938 , but who did they guy the rights from ?"
16566,758,agent_1,i am thinking maybe it was from marvel
16567,758,agent_2,"r maybe itw as fro mthe originla writer and attist jerry siegel amd joe shuster . still , superman has been popular for a long tim"
16568,758,agent_1,yeah he has for sure . do you know hnery cavil ?
16569,758,agent_2,he was the most recent superman . some think he won't e making nay more movies wiht cc
16570,758,agent_1,yeah and he almlstm issed the call for superman
16571,758,agent_2,i guess dch as more hope in continuing aquaman then they do in doing any future superman movies wit hcavill
16572,758,agent_1,do you know ho2 they named teh villain ?
16573,758,agent_2,"i'm not ure , but i don't think the name existed before they used it"
16574,758,agent_1,"yeah that js true . they made it up , brainiac"
16575,758,agent_2,"it's illegal to name your child superman in swdne . you also can't use the names elvis , ikea , jetallica , or v34anda . i think that shows what they deem important"
16576,758,agent_1,wow tha tis interetin . did you wat6ch wonder woman ?

16588,759,agent_2,that's pretty cool . superman gained the baility to fly zat the request of fleischer studkos because animating his repeated jukmps was too difficult .

16725,765,agent_1,"that is impressive . do yoh also like comedy movoes ? apparently kung fu hustle is suppose to be very funny , bill murray really enjoy4d it"
16726,765,agent_2,"murray is a great actor . i've never seen kung fu hustle , have you seen it ?"
16727,765,agent_1,"no i haven't , it's hardt o fidn online i'ge heard a lot of good things about it besides bill murray calling it ' the supreme achievement of the jodern ate in terms of comedy '"
16728,765,agent_2,i l8iked his movies like caddyshack . have you seen it ?
16729,765,agent_1,"yea , caddy shack was great , so was ghost busters , stripes , and a bunhc of oth3rs"

16737,766,agent_1,"yea , that is a good point . i dont like flying gery much . the united states got3 rd place in the first fifa world cup in 1930 . sort of a neat fact ."
16738,766,agent_2,it's slightl surpriasing that the us men have neer won a world cup . i know htat there are a lot of taented countries but i would have thoughtt hey'd have won at elast one by now .
16739,766,agent_1,"yezh , that is amazing because there is a lot of talent . i learned that therea re no net economic gains for the countries that have played host to the olympic s, that seems odd ."
16740,766,agent_2,"it costs a lot to host an olympic vames , some countries have part of the infrastructurfe already but a lot end up building stadiums and armneas that become abandoned after ."
16741,766,agent_1,"oh that is a really good poin , i haven't not ever though of igt that way before . totally makes sense ."
16742,766,agent_2,i know that was a problem with brazil and china recently . their stadiums are completely out of uyse now .
16743,766,agent_1,"oh wow , sort of sad . i also lioke to dfollow the player cristiano ronaldo hte pro footballer fom portugal ."
16744,766,agent_2,"yes he's had a rough couple o fmonths in yhe headlines recen,ty though ."
16745,766,agent_1,"yehga , i know , i even heard that he wss expelled from school for throwing a chair at a teacher . that seems a little extreme ."
16746,766,agent_2,"his school probably had a zero tolerance policy , a lot of schools do these days ."
16747,766,agent_1,thais probably a good rule and very true . i know that he also refuses to get any tattoos on his body in order to be able to donate blood . that zseems like a very worthy cause and a good person to do that .
16748,766,agent_2,yes he does have a lot of greay qualities . i saw an inerview where someone attempted to speak portugese to hm that did not speak it naturlaly . h4 chastised the other reporters for making fun of that person's attempt .
16749,766,agent_1,"haha , nice . i like peo0le to stick up to bullies i nthe medi aora nywher4 else ."
16750,766,agent_2,i originally did not care mucy for him bedause he seemed cocky but thars eems to only be on thbe football field where probably haz ezrned the right to be a littl ebit of a showboat .
16751,766,agent_1,"yeah , it would be funny if playefs had to wear a hat associated with their personality . the most popualr hat in historh was a bowler hat ,n ot the cowboy hat ."
16752,766,agent_2,"it's a lot snsller , i bet it stayeds on your head better on a windy day ."
16753,766,agent_1,"yeah , thgat would hlep a lot . the origins of a conical party hat that was derived from the dunce capst hey were w9rn at parties to encourage foolish and silly beahvior , lol ."
16754,766,agent_2,i've probalby eanred myself f ew duncec aps at parties ebfore !
16755,766,agent_1,"ha , you and me both !"
16756,766,agent_2,"it was fun chatting with you today , have a good one !"
16757,767,agent_1,ehy thuee do you ever wear a hat ? i'm personally bald so i wear one all the time lol
16758,767,agent_2,i think i look funny in them so i don't haha .
16759,767,agent_1,"haha , well i just think th4y look goid on me , hbut i kno weveryone ha sa different shaprd head . i guess hat until 1998 , british politicians had to wsar a top hat , that seem really siplly"
16760,767,agent_2,intdresting . i think the royal canadian mounted polic hats look pretty coo l.
16761,767,agent_1,what dot hose look like ? i don't khnow that i've seen them before . do you ever wqtch old western movies ? apparently the bowler cap was more popula rthna the cowboy hat
16762,767,agent_2,i guess they are describedf as eaked or brimmee . i don't think they are protective . they look kind of like a forest rnager hat .
16763,767,agent_1,"ok i'll have to check those out sometime , do you know what a hairpin is by the way ? do you know the ones rhat females wear , apparently in 1908 they passed a ,aw to limit their lenfth , they werew orried that people use them as weaponxs lol"
16764,767,agent_2,that is prettyc ool . i want a weapon hairpin haha . another cool thing i'd like is a hat and a sword that i'd get if i go tmy phd in fijland .
16765,767,agent_1,"wow that's cool ! they should give those out everywhere haha . you kno whow you cqn tilp your hat ? apparently that started with knights using their face visors , that's pretty cool"
16766,767,agent_2,ibteresting ! i think we should go back to wearing alls orts of different hats . london black casb design was originally made to accommodate the height of bowl;er hats .
16767,767,agent_1,"i agree with you , i don't think people are enough hats these days haha . did you ever wear a dunce cap before ' apparnetly the conical part7 hat was used to encourage foolish b4havior and that's how hte ucne cap was started"
16768,767,agent_2,fortunately i have never had to wear a dunce cap . prkotective hats are really useful . the plastic made to use legs is the smae to make hard hats
16769,767,agent_1,"ye si agree with you . i also like how hats can have religious functions , there are the miters hats wonr by buishops and turbnas that he sikhs wear"
16770,767,agent_2,i guess chefs hats keep hair out off ood but it also hqs symbolic meaning .
16771,767,agent_1,"that is interesting . interesting too that soccer players don't need go wear hats lol , are you going to watch the fifa worl cjup this year"
16772,767,agent_2,"no , i am not really into sports . i know thatn early 50 lercrnt of the world watches it though ."
16773,767,agent_1,"yes i agree . i'm not into sports either , and i ez;ecially don't like soccer lol . it is interesting that there is no net economicfg ain to hosting the world cup , o rthe olympics for that matter , i wonder why country still do it"
16774,767,agent_2,qatar wanted ht world cup to be there and they proise dair conditioned stadiums that would reduce the temperqture by 20 cesiuds but also were solar powered .
16775,767,agent_1,"oh wow inteeesting . i didn't know that k, i know that yes they are doing the 2002 fifa cup , but th3 city that is going to host it isn't even built yet apparently ? that seems like it's coming ulp fast lol"
16776,767,agent_2,"oh , interesting . i die not know they got theb id ."
16777,767,agent_1,yes they did . did you know that hungry used to be really good at soccer by the way ? between 1950 and 19t6 they had only one defeat ? and that was in the world cup finals
16778,768,agent_1,"politicians in britain had to wear a top hat in the house of commons , that's hilarious !"
16779,768,agent_2,"r3qlly , that's interestihg . it seem salmost the opposite of what is expected in aeica . wearing hats inside is usually vonsidered rudw ."
16780,768,agent_1,"yea , ameica is funny when it comes to hats , they even passed a law 100 years ago limiting the length of hatpins so they couldn't be used as a weapon"
16781,768,agent_2,"we have such silly udtms when it comes toh ats . rhink about the mortarboard we wear for geaduation ,. wno thoughf that ailly thing up ."
16782,768,agent_1,"i don't know , i read that conical party hats were derived from dunce caps"
16783,768,agent_2,"and were ou aware that in the old west , it wasn' tthe cowboy hsat that was the most po;pular , but actually the bowler hat ."
16784,768,agent_1,"that's crazy , i don't even think i'ver seen a bowler hat , must not be that cool if they ween't in the movies"
16785,768,agent_2,"i bever put much thought into it , but i guess hats have all iinds of various functions , such as protectil nfrom weather , religious reasons , and of course to be fashionable ."
16786,768,agent_1,"yea , knights wore hats and helemts to protect tehmselves in battle"
16787,768,agent_2,"i guess a helmet could be considered a type of hat . i never thought about it that way . why co you think olice wear hats ? it isn't protectong much , and the royal canadian police have th egoofiest lookign hats there are"
16788,768,agent_1,"i don't know , mayeb to keep hte sun out their eyes ir rain"

16790,768,agent_1,"i don't know , they do play a lot of hockey and when 3 goals are scored by one player it's cal,ed a hat trick"
16791,768,agent_2,it seems liek people don't wear hats as often these days ss they used to many years ago . like when you see a movie about engpladn hundreds ogf years ago and all te rich people wore hats . maybe it wa slike a status symbok of sorts back then .
16792,768,agent_1,"yew , i know rich people like to tip their hats which started from medieval knights"
16793,768,agent_2,oh really ? that is an interesting oriin of thatc ustom . do people still tip their hats to each other ?
16794,768,agent_1,sometimes just to be funny mostly
16795,768,agent_2,"you know who else wars hats , chefs . well , at least in tnem ovies . i don' tknow if i have eve rseen a chef actuaplly w4aring a hat while cooking ."
16796,768,agent_1,basebal. players wear hats too
16797,768,agent_2,"true , hence baseball caps which are popular with everyone tuhese days , but they do seem to serve a function with baseball palyes ."
16798,768,agent_1,"that is true , i think i'm gonn ahead to the mall to look for an ew hat , nice taloing with yoi"

16802,769,agent_2,that is funny . i always thought they wore a wig . chefs have their own style of hats as well called the toque .
16803,769,agent_1,"i guess everyone ha ssome sort6 of a hat to wear . apparently the most popula rhat used to be the bolwer one , not the cowboy hat in the old west"
16804,769,agent_2,and don't forget tne styles that catholicb ishops wear or the sikht urbane
16805,769,agent_1,yup for sure . do you know how the whole tuhng about tippinb the hat originated ?
16806,769,agent_2,no how did tha5t start ? i think its funny tha tlondon cabs have thr desig nthey o to accomodate hats !
16807,769,agent_1,that is a g0od on4 . it came fromt he knights back in the day who raised their visors to show frienrdliness
16808,769,agent_2,that makes sense . i wonder whether tuey had phd's ? in finlan dwhen you get your degree you get a top hat and a sword !

16812,769,agent_2,i believe in qatar even though it isc razy hot there . japa nmade a bid for it however .
16813,769,agent_1,yeah but it seems the city where it will take place does not exist as of yet . maybe they are building it still
16814,769,agent_2,"that is pretty crazy though if 46 percent of the global population watch the world cup , then it should be able to raise some money !"
16815,769,agent_1,i know so i do not understand how the host countries do not make any money off of ot .
16816,769,agent_2,yes you would think they would . did you know that there was once a goupt hat ende dwit a 4way tie ? wonder how that got resolved ?

16963,776,agent_2,"yea me neithe5 , i dp like the old star wars movies released from1 9771983"
16964,776,agent_1,"i like those too . i dont like the new ones because of all the graphics . the gi is not a story . it supports a story . if the story is weak , then cgi cant save it ."
16965,776,agent_2,yea plus marcia lucas really made the story of the original trilogy better
16966,776,agent_1,she had a good understanding of th estory . george needs guidance on such things . he is creative but needs others to snape his ideas .
16967,776,agent_2,"yea , mayb ehe stoppedc aring after making billions fro, the licensing and merchadnise from star wars"
16968,776,agent_1,he probably has to suffer the rest of his lire with hie billi9ns and no oscar .
16969,776,agent_2,"yea , and atching the new movies . i wojder what he thinks of guardians of the galaxy , uames gunn di a good job writing the screenplay"

16975,777,agent_2,yes i do bu not like balle tdancers . they cna go through 4 pairs of pointe shoes in a week .
16976,777,agent_1,that is shocking . i used to date a ballet dancer acrually . and i can cnfirm that they always have feet problems
16977,777,agent_2,i imagine . . . dis she put dry tea bags in her shoe sto absorb any odors ? i've heard that works .
16978,777,agent_1,i should have had her do that . no she didn't but she did not6 have dmelly fee teither . i will have to put that in my memory banks to try on myself haha
16979,777,agent_2,"m etoi . . . did you know someone found 5 , 000 year old shoes that 0erform better than modern shoe4s ? i wonder if nike is on that . . ."
16980,777,agent_1,wow maybe they have a pet done that . i would love to try those shoes on . dud you know stephon marbury helped to promore a line of shoes that was only 15
16981,777,agent_2,"yep . did you know that during a g20 summit , russia gave delegates thumb drives ? they were prkbably bugged somehow ."
16982,777,agent_1,that'sw really crazy . it doesj't supris eme that russia would do that dough . and yes i guess it har trojan viruses on them . very strange that some it's only began aroundt he year 1955 with the geneva summit
16983,777,agent_2,yeah and spain is the only count5y that has been a permanenty guest at every g20 summi6t .
16984,777,agent_1,that is rewally weird of them . i wonder why they would not request official membershup ? have you heard of the gtame eve online
16985,777,agent_2,dunno . maybe they feel that they are a guaranteed member .
16986,777,agent_1,well it's an online computer game . i guess theya pparently have world summits and they received the world summit award from the united nations
16987,777,agent_2,"did you kno wthat when or if you turn 100 in japan , the p msends you a silver cup ?"
16988,777,agent_1,that'w really coo.l . it's nice that it comes from the prime minister too . also so many people were tuening 100 they ahe to find a way tom ake a cheaper cup hasha
16989,777,agent_2,yep . i can't believ that in 1995 a radio etatio successfully prankc alled queen elizabeth i . i bet someone got fired ove rthat .
16990,777,agent_1,oh definitely ! i love that the prime minister of the uk has a cat with th egovernment title chief mouser to the cabnet office . tgat is soa wesome .
16991,777,agent_2,i'm sure that is one pampered feline . the pm of australia's position doesn't actually exist in their constitution . not much job sexurity there . . .
16992,777,agent_1,note that seems really screwy . have you herd of the actress helean bonhma carter ? gze was in the harry potter movies
16993,777,agent_2,"yes , she's the greatgranddasughterf of the pm of the uk dur9ng ww i ."
16994,777,agent_1,yep isn't that wild . i just think the prime ministdr idea is so djfferent frm that of a president being ana merican i dont' know how i feel about it . i do like the idea of our resident more though hhaa
16995,778,agent_1,"ho's it goign , are you into fashion at all ? nancy plosi's stilettos haw been gettin gcoverage on msnbc"
16996,778,agent_2,yes i am . i think that's an odd thing to cover . but it would be tough to give na 8 hour speech in those things .
16997,778,agent_1,"it's funny how high ehels are being used in political rhetoric , like ann richars commenting on ginge5r rogers being able to do what fred astairec an except in high heels"
16998,778,agent_2,yes i was kind of inte4resting . it seems like it's more a power move than anthing else .
16999,778,agent_1,"yea , i guess the ferragamo vaa pump was a popular shoe for politicians"
17000,778,agent_2,yeah it sounds like it . some people call those highheeled shoes postmenopausal mary jane's !
17001,778,agent_1,apparently the us is the only place obessed wity politician's shoes m even in britain they cared what theresa my wears on her feet
17002,778,agent_2,that is kind of interesting . first lady mealnia trump wa smarked as disaster barbie for wearing 4 inch high heels when sh eboarded air force one .
17003,778,agent_1,"yea even people took issue when michelle obama wor elanvin captoe sneakers to a food bank , it would be nice if 0eople just mind their business"
17004,778,agent_2,yes i agreew . did you know there ar at least q7 ways to tie your shoes ?
17005,778,agent_1,"no , i had no clue . you can also put dry tea bags in yours hoes to absorb oder"
17006,778,agent_2,oht hat's good to know . bill nye the science guy holds a patent for ballet pointe shoe s.
17007,778,agent_1,h must make a lot of mony since professionap ballet dancers can go through 4 pzirs of poin5e shoes in one week
17008,778,agent_2,yes exactly .t here are wizard of oz inspired shoes that acftually guide you home when you click your heels together using a gps system .
17009,778,agent_1,that's prettyc ool but i het the shoes stephlon marbury promotes don't have gps in them since they sellf or 15
17010,778,agent_2,yeah exactly . i wish shoes cost that much nowadays . queen elizabeth ii employs somebody to wear her shoes before ehr to ensure they're c0mfortable . must be nice .
17011,778,agent_1,"yea , the uk s quite odd , the prime minister's ca thas the official title of chief mouser to the cabinet office"
17012,778,agent_2,"that is quitef unny and odd . in 1995 a radio station successfully prznk ca,led queen elizabeth ii by pretending to bhe the prim minister of canada !"
17013,778,agent_1,"that's pretty dfunny , i wonder if the uk's prkme minister ever give out gifts liek japan's"
17014,778,agent_2,yes i'm not sure . andrew bonar la is the only person frm outside the uk to ever become the prime minister of uk . it wasg reat tlaking with you today .
17015,778,agent_1,"well i bave to go , nice chatting with you top"
17016,779,agent_1,"hi , how are you ?"
17017,779,agent_2,alirigth . do you have any interest in shoe styles ? their designs have varied thrpoughout human history
17018,779,agent_1,a little . i want to be more ihnvolved in style but have a wife and 2 little onx so have no money fcor style .
17019,779,agent_2,"yea , i really only care about how comfortable they are but a lot of people are obsessed over them liek when nancy pelosi wore 4 inch stilettos during a soeech"
17020,779,agent_1,"amybe she's jist rea.ly msall and wanted to seem bigger and more powerfull than she really ia . as a 6'6 ' male , fashion does not come in my size so i don't even worrya bout it ."
17021,779,agent_2,"probably , people want to make statements with th3eir fashion choice , especdially women . i guess a ferragamo vara pump endears you to the working class , at leas6t if your nan ricahrds"
17022,779,agent_1,aren't those expensive ? maybe not as expensive as 4 pairs of ba.llet shoes a week but still expensive . . .
17023,779,agent_2,"i hae no idea , maye from a man's pointg of view but i guess a lot of women see ferragamo vara pumps as lower end sh9es"
17024,779,agent_1,i am sure they do not perform as well as 5000 year ol dshoes though .
17025,779,agent_2,would not surprise me at all if a 5000 year odl basi csandal with a thi soel lasted lo0nger than ann richards pumps or condoleezza rice's knee high boots
17026,779,agent_1,' freeze frame mqtrix jump ' ha ! i wonder what the mi.itary thought of her dress . . . .
17027,779,agent_2,lo.l who knows . people were upset with michelle obama or wearing 540 pair of sneakers to z food bank
17028,779,agent_1,"no , they were upset they couldn't afford 540 sneaker s. haters ! i get bugged when people do stuff like that . 540 is such a smal part of her wealth that it's like 50 to normal people ."
17029,779,agent_2,"lol , yea , i really wouldn't even bea ble to tell what a lanvin capoe suede sneakers looked like or if they were wort hover 500 , in fact i wouldn't even bel ooking at the ashoes"
17030,779,agent_1,me oo ! i found steve smith laving his shoes on the field as a rememberance to h0meless without shoes a a nice gesture .
17031,779,agent_2,"yea , steve smith is as pretty syand up guy , too bad most people outside the teams he use to play for wouldn' tknow about him leaving out his cleats as a gesture for homepessness"
17032,779,agent_1,m going to try and put te abags in my gym shoes . see if it works to absorb odor . . .
17033,779,agent_2,"lol , i didn't even know tea bags in a shoe could absorb odor , i wonder which type of tea works best"
17034,779,agent_1,i'll let you know if it is arl grey sinc3e that isw hat i have at home . . .
17035,779,agent_2,"sounds good , all i have is some cheap green tea bags at home , i'll dsee i fthose can get rid of shoe odor"
17036,779,agent_1,nce chatting with you !
17037,780,agent_1,hi there . i love buyign shpes ! i feel that shoe quality is decreasing !
17038,780,agent_2,really ? i know very little about shoes .
17039,780,agent_1,yes apparently there was a 5000 ye3ar old pair of shoes that performed better than their modern counterparts .
17040,780,agent_2,that makes sense . i bet that those shoes had to last a whole lifetime . no way to buy replacements . lol
17041,780,agent_1,yes exactly ! the nba player stephon marbury promoted a line of shoes retailede at 15 .
17042,780,agent_2,why so cheap ? that seems a bit lw ? i guess he wanted to make them available for everyone ?
17043,780,agent_1,"yes i think you're right , whic hexplains hwy he didn't accept any promo money to o it ."
17044,780,agent_2,"ok , tgat makes sense . i guess the shoes would lzast long enough to be worth rhe money ."
17045,780,agent_1,"yeah good point . there was also a football player , steve smith , who left his cleats on the field to raise awareness for homeless people ."
17046,780,agent_2,"that is a great gesture . i wish morea thletes would do things ,ike that ."
17047,780,agent_1,"me too . do you follow the news at all ? the primem inister of uk , theresa may has been trying to get a brexit deal . 10 downong street is her residence !"
17048,780,agent_2,may has a difficult task in front of her . i know that they havbe jhst a short while before the whole brexit thing is supposed to go into effect .
17049,780,agent_1,yeah it sounds very clustered and confusing . what a mess . one odd fact about the prime minister in australia is teh fact that the position isn't even in the cosntitution !
17050,780,agent_2,that is strange . i guess hey just used the uk sgystem becauset hey knew how it worked . strange .
17051,780,agent_1,yes i suppose so . i would want to turn 100 in japan because the primr minister sends you a xsivler cup to celebrate . hopefully full of alcobol !
17052,780,agent_2,"yes , fine japanese sake ! a lot of people live to 100 there . ja;pan might have to rethink giving out cups !"
17053,780,agent_1,haha they are doing something right ! maybe the cheaper cups could just ber ed solo party cup d!
17054,780,agent_2,lol i guess we could try to prank the japanese prime min9ster into giving out cups like that .
17055,780,agent_1,haha it just might work .t hea ctress who played bellatrix in arry potter is a descendqnt of a uk prime minister 21

17130,784,agent_2,"it is a lot of money , star was is greatn ot only because o flucas bu tyis wife was a big influence on the franchise as well"

17138,784,agent_2,"thats was a good one i also liked it , you know star wars holds a guinnessw orld 4ecord for the most successgull film merchandising film"
17139,784,agent_1,i am sure disney will t6ry hard to break that record . the toy industry getd involved before tbe beginning of filming now .
17140,784,agent_2,"i msure they are getting really involve in star wars , thy also own thef ranchise"
17141,784,agent_1,i dont understand wreck i ralph . how could anything be in development that long ?
17142,784,agent_2,maybe disney idj't had much faith on the franchise i do like rhe movuies and i hear the video game is great .
17143,784,agent_1,htere is a wreck it ralph game ? that would be merchandise before th movie .
17144,784,agent_2,"yeah its originally a game i think , a really old arcade game , did you watc hhte movie ffozen ?"

17151,785,agent_2,he has more than johnny depp and will smith !
17152,785,agent_1,that sso crazy to me . they awre such good actors .
17153,785,agent_2,"they are , but the academy awards have been known to make questionalbe decisions . the oscars , itself , has been nominated fore mmys ."
17154,785,agent_1,lol i would agree that they make questionable deciions for just about every award show . it is interesting that walt disney still holds the record for most awards under his anm e.
17155,785,agent_2,blazing saddles was nominated for 3 oscars . great cmedy film .
17156,785,agent_1,i have never seen taht movie before . i take it its worth the watch

17160,785,agent_1,i had no idea how muc hmoneya ctors cvan make just for doing fan signinjgs .
17161,785,agent_2,they probably make so much money fromt hat .
17162,785,agent_1,"i bet , can j7st keep surviving off that"
17163,785,agent_2,i wonder how much aj oscar victory shapes public opinion abo8t you
17164,785,agent_1,"honest,ly i don't think much . people really don't care"
17165,785,agent_2,tha'ts probably true .t heir individual movie perfirmance seems tk be a bigger indicator .
17166,785,agent_1,yep . i think a lot of people don't value awads anymore because thdy truy don't include all actors who deserve to be nominated .
17167,785,agent_2,it's so intriguing that em8nem has so many oscar and emmy nominations .
17168,785,agent_1,"i agree , ik wouldn't think with some of the things he ra0s about , he would be someoen who would be nominated and win so many times ."
17169,785,agent_2,it has been wonderful talking to you !
17170,786,agent_1,it's crazy to think that daniel daylewis has won best actort nree times .

17172,786,agent_1,"hmmm , i think he won for lncoln for sure , and there will be blood . the olatter movie wa sreally good . i'm nmot sure about the third one though ."
17173,786,agent_2,"blazing saddles was nominated 3 times , i honestly have no idea what that movie is about . i guess i probably should check it out ."
17174,786,agent_1,"it s absolutely hilarious . it's gotg ene wilder , the dude who playex willy wonka , . pretty much a 70s spoof on western movies ."
17175,786,agent_2,"oh its a comedy , tehn i definotely wanmt to see it . i love comedy adn spoof movies . i also like science fiction . i can't believe some of the actors mkae so mucn money just from doing autograph signings"
17176,786,agent_1,"yeah , nad on top of that , we think science fiction is supedr cmmon today , but i guess that it's only been mainstream for like 50 years thanks to stanley kurbick ."
17177,786,agent_2,"i agre4e , i think a lot of people were like closet science fiction fnas , but now with all the d9ifferent events and what not they are more comfortable expressing that . i mean some may tak it to far with the whole membership for life that covers you in case you come back"
17178,786,agent_1,"haha at lezst they have all their basis covered . do you know any popular science fiction films tha twon oscars ? i know john williams won a bunch for composing th4 star wars music , bu ti wonder if aby of them won for best picture ?"

17204,787,agent_1,"wow that was a great year for movies , i think the landmqrk scifi movie was 0201 by kubrick bac kin 1968"
17205,787,agent_2,"oh yeah , 2001 : a space odyssey . that was when the sci fi industry started to be taken seriously . and the nonce star wars came out , special effects really became popular an deveryone went crazy over them"
17206,787,agent_1,"ya you'r3 rjght , cool that nasa named gat6aca as th most accurate sci fi film"
17207,787,agent_2,"o hi didn't know that ! i did know that apparently the moi e' woman in the moon ' influenced nasa a littl ein that they use a similar ' countdown ' and a laumch pad , corce , and multistage orbital rockets . it's so coil how sci fi films can be accurate"
17208,787,agent_1,"i agree ! nasa also has a list of space accurate terms for movies to use , nasa is cool !"
17209,787,agent_2,"yeah nasa is definitely really cool , i'd love to learn more abou it . by the way , do you like tenis ? i used to play , but i was really vad haha"

17216,788,agent_1,"i thnk my newg oal i to own a house like the one mel gibson is selling . : ,"
17217,788,agent_2,mu8st be nice to own somethign for 16 million . ocean view is a plus !
17218,788,agent_1,i think the privacy piece is crucial too . and the two different swimming pools seem ideal .
17219,788,agent_2,"wow l, sounding even better . bibson now is 62 and had started his career in australia and received his recognition for ' mad max ' in 1979 '"
17220,788,agent_1,"in that case , i've still got about 2 decades to catch up to where he's at . maybe i can create the next fashion trend luke the tennis guy who invented polo shirts ."
17221,788,agent_2,"if you are interested in acting , then perhaps you can get a start in ar ople like a detective . gibson gained greatwr recognition in the u . s . for his role qs a detective in ' lethal weapon '"
17222,788,agent_1,there we go . i can go d9wn the acting rojte . then i cwn do tbhe whole fan convention thing on the side as well .
17223,788,agent_2,cool ! gibson did ahve a rebuild to his property after a fire in 1996
17224,788,agent_1,i guess that' sthe downside toh aving a multimilliondollar estate . you're al2ays worried about protecting it . mayeb that explains the superfortifiex and boobytrtapped estate nea ratlanta ?
17225,788,agent_2,that i sscary ! the isnide of hijs house sounds excitign though . he has glass antique pocket doors that open out to the canyon nad ocea nviews below .
17226,788,agent_1,meanwhioe 8've got stqndard windws that overlook . . . a bus6yr oad . and the neighbor's house . pretty borin gin comparison . no europeanimported elements or handhewn wood flooring here .
17227,788,agent_2,he seems green f4riendly too . he has working solar panels to supplement the electrical supply to the house .
17228,788,agent_1,that's pretty smart . i think a lot of uberrich people try to be abl3 to set something up ' off the grd ' . i wonder if duchovnyw as responsible for that like he did so many of thse other improvements .
17229,788,agent_2,maybe . do you follow te academy awards ? they are a set of 24 awards for artistic and technical merit in film
17230,788,agent_1,not very much . i tend not to watch too many movies . but i did se esome of the jimmy kimmel one last year . i wonder what films from 2018 will be big winners this arch .
17231,788,agent_2,walt disney won a special oscar in 1938 for snow white . they made a statue that had one regular sized statuette and seveb miniature oscars
17232,788,agent_1,"if anyone deserves a special oscar , it's walt disney . or maybe georges melies . i learned more about his ' a trip to yhe moon ' from th emovie hugo . so i guess i do watvch some movies afteea ll ."
17233,788,agent_2,it looksw like john williams has the most jominations for oscars than anyone but disney

17238,789,agent_2,the winter olympics last year ? weren't the games in north korea ?
17239,789,agent_1,"yes , they were in pyeongchang . the north koreans sent a cheer squad ."
17240,789,agent_2,"i think it woule be great if every country sent a cheer squad . i femember seeing some crowd pictuires from london , 2012 ? , and they all looked bored . do you think it was a good squad ?"
17241,789,agent_1,"i di dnot see it , although the cheer translated as merely ' go team ! '"
17242,789,agent_2,sounds pretty tame . i would have hoped it would be more aggressive . it's the olympics ! top opf the world !
17243,789,agent_1,are you a fan of hockey in the olympics ?
17244,789,agent_2,"i like hoc,ey . it'zs a fast game3 and a very athletric sport . i hear that players can lose several pouds in a game ."
17245,789,agent_1,it amazds met hat a hockey player was once traded for a dollar
17246,789,agent_2,he must have been worth less than taht to the trading team . mayeb they were paying him too much already . do you play hockey ?
17247,789,agent_1,"i do not , but many canadians do , since both hockey and lacrosse are their national spor t."
17248,789,agent_2,"what sports do you play ? i don't play hockey or lacrossde , but i love soccer . i would like a cheer section like they have for club soccer ."

17254,789,agent_2,what oes minor key mean ?
17255,789,agent_1,music typically has upward or downward sounding notes . they are lften found kin goapel and hip hop .
17256,789,agent_2,"and minork ey would be donwward sounding ? yeah , that would be hard to play to . ad a hard cheer . . . even gfor a sad place like north korea . would you join a cheer squad if htey were a supbeawt as the north koreans ?"
17257,789,agent_1,"not sure . perhwps snl could do a skit mocking the situation , like they did with kanye west and taylor sw2ift ."
17258,789,agent_2,"oh , did they mock kanye for hte swift intetrruption ? i thought that was qell before it hzappened . retty funny to think back on , for sure ."

17267,790,agent_2,i saw the 1760 playstation 3's were used by the us de0artent of defense to bu9ild a supercomputer becuase it was the most cost effective .
17268,790,agent_1,"i bet cray wasn't happy . wow , they could host quit ea gaming competition . they could play the gta theme nazd rock out ."
17269,790,agent_2,that would be cool . they are evejn using ps3's to research black holes .

17300,791,agent_2,i wonder if they're studyng the jellyfish to s3e if yhey can discover how to keep humans alive longer .
17301,791,agent_1,"it's possible , they probably could test it out on the zebrafish which shares 84 percent of human genes associated withd iseases"
17302,791,agent_2,"yea , that's amazing . i'll het they study this fisdh in relations to usa nd our diseases ."

17317,792,agent_2,or the immortal breed of jellyfish
17318,792,agent_1,"the jellyfish must lead a boring life . always f,oatinga bout , wondering about teh universe , watchingr eruns ."

17353,794,agent_1,"yesa nd no , i hd no idea he played anythihng . i did likme the msic in the ,ovie ' o' brothber where art tho ' ."

17356,794,agent_2,and a concert is a good date i think . you know when drake went to drake university he did iyt in the middle of the night .
17357,794,agent_1,i'm just not into ra; . to me it's usually very bad and profane poetry set to a wlelworn backbeat . it is impressive the drake was deterjmine tyo finihys hs .
17358,794,agent_2,i like old rap the new rap is hard to understand .
17359,794,agent_1,i think kanye west is hard to undersand . he thinks aids is a manmade diseqse ? wow .
17360,794,agent_2,i think kanye west has been differ3nt since he married kim kardashian . the songg olddigger is a minor key
17361,794,agent_1,ysah but it seems she already ahs the gold . iot hink htat whole kardashian thing is weird .
17362,794,agent_2,yes .s heg ot famous fro ma sex tape . some musicians are smart . big sean had a 3 . 7 gpa and turned down a scholarship to be signed to kany6es label
17363,794,agent_1,i wonder what the major was . a 3 . 7 in physics isn't the same as a 3 . 7 in music appreciation . i thinks it's good htat kanye west can make fun of himself on snl .
17364,794,agent_2,"yes , but he cna eb arrogant sometimes . i still don't understnad his relationship with donqld trump ."
17365,794,agent_1,that is bizarre . . . i think he'll do anything to get his face in tue limeligt . like the interrupting thing nhe did to taylor swift .
17366,794,agent_2,ad thatw as not even about him . he felt beyonce should have won . i think it was nice of himt o give his mic to a fan i9n a wheelchair at his concert . taht shows the good side of him .
17367,794,agent_1,"yeah , ghat's cool . i would say to kayne what one would say to a child about the interrupting thing . what if everyone did that when they didn't get their wa ?"
17368,794,agent_2,kanye west wzs upset after hearing ekinems verse on drakes labum so he took two days and cancelled his appointments to rewfite his

17376,795,agent_1,yea daft punk is cool and they dijd a great job with the tron oegacy soundtrac
17377,795,agent_2,"i agree ! i was gong to mention that . phil collins recorde the english , ital8an , german , spanish , and french version of the tarzan sountrack . that's p0retty incredible !"
17378,795,agent_1,"it is pretty cool , so are the names on the batman begins soundtrack that are form names of bat genus"
17379,795,agent_2,wow . i jever thougnt of that but yu're right ! do you like kanye west ?
17380,795,agent_1,"i liked his first albums and gold sigger was a good song , it's the only top 10 hit kayned id in minor5 key"
17381,795,agent_2,i didn't know that . i never seen his snl skit where he mocked himself for interrupting award shows . hav eyou seen it ?
17382,795,agent_1,no but i did see a ideo of kayne giving his mic to a fan in a wheel chair before
17383,795,agent_2,that was pretty cool of him to do that . ometimes he ha ssome different views on things . like for exmaple he believes hat aids is a manmade disease .
17384,795,agent_1,maybe big sean canh explain that to him since he had a 3 . 7 gpa before signing with kayne
17385,795,agent_2,nice gpa ! are you familiar with drake ?
17386,795,agent_1,"somewhat , i know he's a rapper and was in degrassi"
17387,795,agent_2,hice . he traduated high school at the ag eof 25 in 2012 . he must have quit and went bac ?
17388,795,agent_1,"i guess so , most people graduate copllevw before 25 , not high school like rake"
17389,795,agent_2,hahahaha his debut studio a.bum thank me later was released in 2010 and debuted at number 1 .
17390,795,agent_1,nice . kayn3 west took 2 days to rewrite his verse on forever after he heard eminems
17391,795,agent_2,nic e! i remember his debut the college dropout that cam lut in 2004 . it wss a huhe success nd put him on the map .
17392,795,agent_1,wlel i hve to go . nice talking with you
17393,796,agent_1,i like when different races date and learn about weach other . i think people should be open to this more often . this couple seems like theh would work
17394,796,agent_2,yeah that was a insteresting story . do you listen to music ? specififally kanye west or drake ?
17395,796,agent_1,"yes i like kayne west , he seems like hnes twnds upf or what he belives in . he also seems like a nice guy . i heard he even helps people and gives to his fans as much as he can . i think eh does movie soundt5afks"
17396,796,agent_2,sure that sounds all good on pazper lol but he has been acting crazy for while now . he goe son all these uncalled gor rants . i am definitely not a fna of his and hs music isnt even that good and he always claims to eb thbe best rapper vwer .
17397,796,agent_1,"well i woudl go back and take a look at hid work , he has has lots of hits . he has some of the most popular songs ever like his song gold digger . he also is v3ry freative . i thinki he just fe4l that democrats have not done enough in 30 years and they are usin gblacks to tet elected ."
17398,796,agent_2,"ghat is just my opinion of him , i do not like him and i personally do not find his music good reguardless of how mnyh its he has . they do ot sound good at all to me ."
17399,796,agent_1,"i am not a huge fan , i like techno and alternative rick more . i also lik emovie soundtracks like jaws and movies with dramafic cool sounds like batman . kanye could do movie soundtracks and impress people ."
17400,796,agent_2,ij recently learned that mihael ajckson helped with the sonic e3 soundtrack .
17401,796,agent_1,"thst is amazing , i think music can make a movie or game much morre mermorabpe . they have coo, soundtracks on spotify , i even hear you can create custom playlist"
17402,796,agent_2,alicia keys was only 16 whens he recorred the men in black sountrack .
17403,796,agent_1,"that amazing , i heard that daft punk got the rights to do the tron movie ; they did it in exchange for pancakes . yummy !"
17404,796,agent_2,that is interesting . tehy must really like pancakes .
17405,796,agent_1,it would be ool 8f drqake did songs for movies . i heard he is a big fan of winnie the pooh gooks . most people do not kno3 eh collects them . he sound do a movie and make a gangster pooh
17406,796,agent_2,i didnt know he appeared in juwstin biebers video ' baby '
17407,796,agent_1,yea drake is very soft nd sensitive . when he did a sogn with meinm he had to cxhange his because he thought ekinems part was better .
17408,796,agent_2,how does hat show he is soft and sensitive ? be probably just wanted his pzry to sound as good as eminems
17409,796,agent_1,a rapper being in justin bibers videos us soft in my gook . plud what grown mad collects whinne the pooh books . he also was n a teen show called degrassi .
17410,796,agent_2,"lol k . that video is pretty opd , maybe he wa sjust gettingn oticed an dmaing appearabces , doesnt really mean he is soft and sensitive . winne the pooh boioks are classics , they will probably be worth a lot in the futur . ."
17411,796,agent_1,his dance movesa re very girly also . if yous ee him dance in his video hot line bling you will know . he got a grammy fo4 that song .
17412,796,agent_2,"i have seen that video . i dont think that his dancing is tgirly , just a different style . but i do not like that song , it doesnt sound good to e ."
17413,796,agent_1,"do you lioe his song gods plan , i heard it broke streaming records . that sng is pretty good ."

17417,797,agent_2,i thin the last soundtrack i bought was guardian's of the galaxy tor my kid
17418,797,agent_1,did you know each soundtrack of batman begins is named after a genus of bwts ?
17419,797,agent_2,"that's really cool ! i had the original byman soundtrack years ago , but none of the more recent oens . ig uess steven spielberg played ts dclarine thimself on the jaws soundtrack ."
17420,797,agent_1,i sure do enjoy it when directors play a direct part in their creations
17421,797,agent_2,"lol yeah . everybody says the o brother where art thou soundtrack is great , but i haven't hear d9t . i think george clooney is on it ."
17422,797,agent_1,so is their ay musicias you follow ?
17423,797,agent_2,no but my son is a huge fan of rp . i think he bought a drake albu mrecently . rrakes song hotline bling is sampled from the 1972 song why we can't live togethe r.e verything old is new again !
17424,797,agent_1,ah drake is a recognized choice . surprisingly he gain initial fame for being a actor on degrassi rather than as a musician .
17425,797,agent_2,"wow i didn't knowf hat ! weird that he was on a show about a high shcool , since he sidn't graduate until he was 25 years old !"
17426,797,agent_1,i guess he was a perfect fit sicne he was in high school during the show ?
17427,797,agent_2,"ig uess so . his 4th album , views , broke a lot of records , like it was in the top 100 for 13 nonconsecutive weeks . i guess he wasn't hur tby finishing school so late !"
17428,797,agent_1,"well now that he is so successfjl he is spending irt on som odd things , like first edition children's books"
17429,797,agent_2,"oh yes , ih eard he bought copies of fharlottre's web and winnie the pooh in the uk ;"
17430,797,agent_1,"in any case , how abo7t kanye west ?"
17431,797,agent_2,he seems like kind of a weird guy to me . he says aids is a manmade conspiracy disease .
17432,797,agent_1,i hope he doesn't rhink vwccines dause autism
17433,797,agent_2,oh god i hope not ! yhere are peoplse who will listen because h4's a celebrity . shakes head and rolls eyes i hear his music is good though . i havet o admit i haven't hcecked it out .
17434,797,agent_1,"i usually listen tow hat musicians say for musid and what doctors say for medixine . i don't trust most musicians to tell me how to treat my ody . in any xase , i had a wonderful tim chatting with you and i personally think his music is great , though some of his though aren't as much"
17435,797,agent_2,cool . nice to talk to yu !

17437,798,agent_1,hi do you like aatronomy ?
17438,798,agent_2,"its very interesting , but tnis is the first time i have read about the gnaymede being so large"
17439,798,agent_1,that woulr be jupiter's moon ? i wonder if jupiter is one of the five planets visible to the naked eye .
17440,798,agent_2,i would guess from it size it is
17441,798,agent_1,th e0lanef venu is the only planet6 that rotates clockwise and has no seasons . that seems bloring .
17442,798,agent_2,"uranus also has a strange rotation , it rolls around rather than spinning"
17443,798,agent_1,that is unique . i think mars sounds like w weird planet . it is calle dred panet nhd named for the roman god of war .
17444,798,agent_2,yes it zays because of the iron oxide
17445,798,agent_1,mars i salso cosnideresd a terrestrial planet and the fourth 0planet fromt he sun . must be hot there .
17446,798,agent_2,nut it hax polar icecaps like us
17447,798,agent_1,true and valleys and deserts s maybe it is pretty diverse . it is the second smallest planet in the solar system .
17448,798,agent_2,i did not know wifi was a byproduct from astronomy
17449,798,agent_1,that is pretty neat . i didn't either . the town of saadat sahh rin iran u scalled the astrobomy town and even bought an observatory . on special occasions thehy turn off all lightd to improve the view of th enight sky .
17450,798,agent_2,i wonder what would pe9ple would say if we did thaf to an americsn town
17451,798,agent_1,pople would probably like it . did you know mercury was the smalelst planet ?
17452,798,agent_2,"yes i did ,"
17453,798,agent_1,would youb e interested in the mars colonization project planned for 2023 ? i guess it will be a reality tv show .
17454,798,agent_2,"it would be cool , i did not know plantd like lichen could livd there alreadyh ."
17455,798,agent_1,yeah i think it sounds cool as well . it would take 2 or 3 day sto get there unde constant 1g acceleration . that's a bit long !
17456,798,agent_2,it seems long
17457,798,agent_1,well it's been nice catting . maybe i'll see you on that trip to mars . lol !
17458,798,agent_2,one day bye
17459,798,agent_1,have a nice day .
17460,799,agent_1,good evening ! are you into astronomy ? rid you know that venus has no seasons because it doesn't tilt ?
17461,799,agent_2,i enjot learnign about it . hat is interesting abut venus . our solr system is prettyv ast
17462,799,agent_1,t is ! did you know rhat there is a planet where shards of glass precipitwte sideways at 4500 mph in 200 degree fahrenheit weather . it sounds fascinating .
17463,799,agent_2,wow ! it also sounds dangerous ! how about the fact that all of the planets woudl fit btweenb the earth and our moon ?
17464,799,agent_1,yes ! fascinating . and precursors to life have beend iscovered in a plnaetatry system about 465 light y4ars away .
17465,799,agent_2,i wonder how they determinedt hat ? that seems like a microscopic issue rather than a telescopic one .
17466,799,agent_1,"yes , i would like to know . i've been reading about observational versus theoretical astronomy , but i don't know what research methods would have been use4d to detectt he building blocks of life so far away ."
17467,799,agent_2,can you imagine how complex the orbitw ould be for that planet that orbits four stars ?
17468,799,agent_1,i haven't heard of that planet ! what is it called ?
17469,799,agent_2,"that was all k read about it . however , hte math that describes orbiting one sta is complex enough . tha5 math wouls b ecraay ."
17470,799,agent_1,yes ! did you know that planet swere redefined in 2006 by the astronomical union ? it's been controversial . the definition is based on where an object orbits andd isregards its mass .
17471,799,agent_2,i suppose that is why pluto waa downgraded . i wonder how the chinese are controlling heir rover on the dark side of the moon righ tnow .
17472,799,agent_1,"yes , i wonder . ceres , pallas , junpoa nd vesta were also once consideree planets and then downgraded ."
17473,799,agent_2,mankind has studied astronomy f9r a long time .? even the vatican ha an observatory for studying i t.
17474,799,agent_1,yes ! and the ancient babylonians too !
17475,799,agent_2,"harlow shapley , a noted astronomer decided to study it because it was the first suvbject in the xourse catalog at coillege . stragne world we .ive in ."
17476,799,agent_1,"yes , and a byproduct of astronomical research led to the development of wifi . had you heard that ?"
17477,799,agent_2,no . but i am old enough to rememger teflon being a byproduct of space exploration by the usa .
17478,799,agent_1,fascinating ! i was not aware of thzt . did you know that sounds are higher pitcehd on mars because of atmospheric differences ?
17479,799,agent_2,no . but it makes sense . sound is different in water here on earth . i also read of a town in iran that is so much into astronomy that they shut the lights down on occasion to improve thev iew of the night sky .
17480,799,agent_1,"wow ! that would be a fun place to visit . well , it's been good talking to you ! have a wonderful evening !"

17483,800,agent_1,"he , is i think h eaniled 5he rfole3 and well the movir has a pretty good cast as well"
17484,800,agent_2,"yeah . did hyou know deafpool described himself as ryan reynolds with a sharpei , before ryan was even cast ?"
17485,800,agent_1,"really ? that is an interesting gact , another cdool fact is tah tthe vido gam4e cost more to make than the movie"
17486,800,agent_2,wow . apparentlyt he voice of the mystery villain is ryan as well
17487,800,agent_1,you know deadpool is te highest grossing r rated film to have a different director than cameron or lucas ! !
17488,800,agent_2,"i did not know that , quite something . speaking ot syperheroes , do you like marvdl comics ?"
17489,800,agent_1,"i do , some of my favorite heroes ae from tem zrvel comics universe , i ure love the movies"
17490,800,agent_2,did you knos they offered the right to sony for all eujperheroes and they only bought sony ?
17491,800,agent_1,"i heard they bough spiderman and i used to like the ld spiderman movies with goby maguire as the star , he was a good spiderman"
17492,800,agent_2,"yeah i wi,l agree with that , for ure . tehy should have bought the rest when they had a chance"
17493,800,agent_1,"i agre , considering now they are worth billions , that sure was a poor investment decision ,t he xmne are also pretty good , i lik ethem"
17494,800,agent_2,did you know marvel successfully argues j ncourt that mutants in xmen are not huamns ?
17495,800,agent_1,i didnt and did sinning that argume4nt helped them in ang way ?
17496,800,agent_2,"yeah it did actually , they paid the lower rate on toys"
17497,800,agent_1,"oh i see im guessing thaf madee them illions hten , wonder woma is aso a great film , have you watched thzt one"
17498,800,agent_2,yeah i have i really loved it and looking forward to the second one . you ?
17499,800,agent_1,"i did , i thought it was a decent film and will watch the second one for sure , it generated a lot of money"
17500,800,agent_2,yeah it is the highest grossing superhero orjgin movie
17501,800,agent_1,"and laso highest grossing wwi movie , i gues swonde rwoman has a lo tof fans ."
17502,801,agent_1,hi . do you like superheroes ? i really like wonder woman and the film they made based off of her in 2017 .
17503,801,agent_2,"seome of thme . i haven't seen wonder womasn yet . i guess i should , it ist he top grssing movie for ww i movie ."
17504,801,agent_1,it was really good and the lead actress gal gadot did a fantastic job . it could be because shje served two years as a soldier in the israel defense forces .
17505,801,agent_2,that would be good prep . she didn't even realize she was auditioning for taht paet ! i love to hezr stuff like that !
17506,801,agent_1,i like how far wonder woman's character has come . when she first appeared in 1941 tje group made her their secretary .
17507,801,agent_2,it wzs good for 2omen too . 2017 was the 1st year since1 958 thatt e top 3 ighest grossing movies were female led .
17508,801,agent_1,taht is so cool . comic book movies are really successful but i vuess it wasn't always that wzy . un 1998 marvel offered sojny almost all of its characters flr 25 millio nbut they rejected because they only wanted spiderman for 10 million .
17509,801,agent_2,it seems like thet have really taken of lately .m arvel crrated a characer named lbue ear for a 4yearold boy that had hearing problems . that was cool .
17510,801,agent_1,that is so kind . and it startedd because he did not want to wear his hearing aids and told his mother ' super heroes dont wear hearinga ids ' so marvel created one .
17511,801,agent_2,very cool . did you know there uis one characte4 owned by both marvel and dc that is designed to keep the companies' universes separate ?
17512,801,agent_1,leave it up to big business to find a way tok eep their ingestment safe ?. it is interestin gthat disney does not own the rights to bi marvel characters east of the mssissippi due to contract with universal studios .
17513,801,agent_2,i guess one woukd need to be a lawyer to understand the mississippi thing . cid you lik eeither of the dead poo lmovies . funny dark humor . . .
17514,801,agent_1,i onlys aw tue fidst one not the secomdb ut i think i should . it is teh highest grossing r rated film not directed by james cqmsroln or georg elucas .
17515,801,agent_2,i guess it cost more to make the video game htan the 1st movie . sw development ise xpensive !
17516,801,agent_1,"what is nice is even though it is competition for directors like james camefpn , he read the script and championed the film to fox executives ."
17517,801,agent_2,good for hi m. it is true that people get used to one particula5 actor doing superheroes . ic an't imagine anyone but reynolds dokng deadpool . . .
17518,801,agent_1,what is odd is that the comic book series in 2004 had deadpol describe himself as ' ryan reynolds crosed with a shar pei ' so ryan reynolde believed he wa sdestined fo rthe rope .
17519,801,agent_2,it seems that is true . he has that personality . downey is another one for iron man .
17520,801,agent_1,i think the samet hing about hugh jackman as wolverine but the director knew him as musical theater australian unknown actor .
17521,801,agent_2,interesting . i guess tue case could vr made for gal gadot for wonder woman .
17522,801,agent_1,some people are just born to play the role . well thank you fpr hcatting . i learned al ot of ne wand fun information today .
17523,802,agent_1,nhello have you seen deadpool 2 ? ?
17524,802,agent_2,"i haven't een it yet , did you ? i am a p5etty big fan of the marvel comics universe though ."
17525,802,agent_1,"yeah i have seen it , it was really good and funny ."
17526,802,agent_2,how was ryan reynolds ? he's carved out a pretty iconic roel for himself as deadpool and was great in the virst one .
17527,802,agent_1,"oh yeah , for sure , he was perfect for this role . did gou know in the 2004 comic deadpool describes himself as a ' ryan reynold swith a sharpei ' which elad ryan to believe he was destined for ther ole lol"
17528,802,agent_2,"no , that's awesome though . did you know james cameron and david fincher were involved in pusdhing for d4adpool 2 to be made . two pretty big names right there ."
17529,802,agent_1,wow that i sawesome . thats pretty funny that thed eadpool videogame cost more to mkae than the movie . lol i enver 0layed t4eh game .
17530,802,agent_2,are you a fan of zny the other marvel charcters or movies ? stz nlee's estate must havre been very valuable .
17531,802,agent_1,"yeh i love all of them , i guess if id have to pick , ir eally like htor , guardians of the galaxy ancd avngers . how about u ?"
17532,802,agent_2,9'm a vig fan or thor . i thought ragnorak was the best marvel movie . chris ehmsworth is swesme as thor . they probably couldn't have picked anyons better .
17533,802,agent_1,right ! thor ragnarok was hilarious ! that was the best ofv the thors .
17534,802,agent_2,it's funny back in 1998 sony could have ougth all cinematic rights for marvel for 25 million but they decidsd rejected hte offer . i bet they wish they didn't .
17535,802,agent_1,"i know right , this couldve eben big awhile ago , but i guess they only wanted spiderman ."
17536,802,agent_2,"yeah , crazy . oops . did you know there's a cha4acter owned by both marvel and dc ?"
17537,802,agent_1,"no , who is it ?"
17538,802,agent_2,"it's this character called access . it's kind of weird , his sole purpose is to keep the amrvel and dc separate universe separate from each other ."
17539,802,agent_1,"thats cool , i wonder if they will make a movie about him , since both dc and ma5vel have a ton of movies and tv shows out now ."
17540,802,agent_2,i don't think so . do you like any of the dc moies ? i heard wonder woman was good but didn't see it .
17541,802,agent_1,"yeah wonder woman was great , i think the second one is coming out soon , th newer supermans with henry cavill are good , i lik4 the batman series too , asnd the tv show the flash . arrow was good but hes sod ark , i only have room for one dark super hero and i like batman lol"
17542,802,agent_2,"cool , how did you like gal gadot as wondr woman ?"
17543,802,agent_1,"she is awesome , really great actress , i liked her in fast n furious series . she also sedved in the isreali army . well i believe everyone in isrealh as tp serve its a law"
17544,802,agent_2,i didn't even know she was in the fast n furious series . i remember the classic lynda carter wonder woman too . do you ?
17545,802,agent_1,no i don?'t think i ever watched the older wonder woman . yeah she plays giselle i nfast n furious .
17546,802,agent_2,"i eemembe rmy pzrents used to have it on every once in a whol e, it was pretty good . i should chec kout the new movie . can't believe marvel started in 1939 ."
17547,802,agent_1,"i kno wright , its been awhile ! its been fun chatting ."
17548,803,agent_1,"hi k, ho9w are you ?"
17549,803,agent_2,"hlelo , doing great ! you ? are you interested in astronomy ?"
17550,803,agent_1,sure . i don't know much about it . what about you ?
17551,803,agent_2,"i'm impartialo bu ti am surprised by a couple of facts in my reading , like when september ends , the planet is even brighter than in previou smonths ."
17552,803,agent_1,people have been watchingv th eskie forever . ancient babylonians ha d awere abl eto track plaents such a sjupiter with matyhmeatical precision . nowadays we're pretty disconnected from the solar system .
17553,803,agent_2,"yes and without speciak equipment , only five planets in the solar system are visible to th enaked eye ."
17554,803,agent_1,the tech for viewing planets has had benefit in oter areeas . a critical step in dcreation of wifi was a byproduct of research into improving astronomy
17555,803,agent_2,"that information gained can also be compiled to prodce sounds and songs that illustrate what sp;ace is like for visually impaired individuwls , that's pretty neat !"
17556,803,agent_1,would you want to live on mars ? a mars dolonization project is planned for 2023 .
17557,803,agent_2,"i'm not sure , but if i did , i don't think i want to be one of the first ones on there . do you ? an ddo you think colonization on maes by 2023 is feadible ?"
17558,803,agent_1,"no , not realy . flying to mars underc onstant 1g accelaration takes only 2 or 3 days . bu tdo we have tech like this ?"
17559,803,agent_2,"i'm not sur and even if yhere is tech taht is capable of that , do humans survive that at those speeds ? it'll be pretty neat to see ther sunset on mars though , because it is blue ."
17560,803,agent_1,"i guess that's because the aqtmosphere is different . i don't knoww aht kins ofl ife it6 can support , but there is an atmospher e."
17561,803,agent_2,"yes , i think i'd like to visit the saadat shahr 'astronomy town' because the residents have a strong passion for stargwazing , so that's whatf the small stargazing community is called ."
17562,803,agent_1,i wonder if they'll fin da planet that can support life . astronomers have alreadry de6tected building blocks of life in a planetary system 455 lightyears from us .
17563,803,agent_2,"i think we wil, or mayeb the movie with matt damon really convinced me , i forgot what it was called ."
17564,803,agent_1,"i don't remember either . i think that it'se xpensive dn high risk . probably better to invest in better ways to live on this planet , the one we're designed for ."
17565,803,agent_2,i agree but i must say that human perception of the planets have hcanbged as scientidic knowledge advanced . i wonder how older generations of peopl efeel about th esoalr system knowing what we know todsy .
17566,803,agent_1,they feel the way that the younger gneerations will in 40 years . astonished about how muhc has been learned and our tiny place in the universe . i enjoyed chatting with you !

17581,804,agent_1,"i am not sure , i do nkt pay much attention to studies as i do to the movie sthey make . marvel did create a special superhero for a little boy though"
17582,804,agent_2,which superhero didt hey create for the little boy ?
17583,804,agent_1,it is called blue ear because the litlte boy was hard of hearing
17584,804,agent_2,"that is heartwarming . did you know that marvel claimed in court that since mutants aren't pekple , they should pay the lower rate on xmern toys . because they're not cnsidered human , so they don't qulaify az dolls ."

17629,806,agent_1,"ww now that's drama . james earl jonezs spent 2 . 5 hours only recording all of darth vadors lines for 7 ,5 00 ."
17630,806,agent_2,"if only he knew what that would do , he would have demanded more . or if he was paid by the hour , at least talk slower ."
17631,806,agent_1,right but i'n sure that was a lot of money back then .
17632,806,agent_2,not if all 8 of them made 8 . 5b in total box office ! that's a small percent for a main character !
17633,806,agent_1,"7 . 500 for twoh ours of work will work for me my friend ,l ol . astronauts in a space suit can not whistle ."

17664,808,agent_1,i wonder if it was for the good or for the bad lol
17665,808,agent_2,yes i would like to know that as well ! i think it's so cool that george lucas was able to keep licensing and merchandising rights fo them self . it really paid 9f !
17666,808,agent_1,"fors ure , he would not be3 wortu nearly as much as he is now . did you ever hear how much james earl jones was paid for his voice"
17667,808,agent_2,"i alost don't believe this number but he was only paid 7500 , can you belive that ?"
17668,808,agent_1,"i believe that , that would ve like 3000 dollars per hour i bet lol . i am hoping he made more after the fidst6 movie"
17669,808,agent_2,yeah i am sure he did . in 2013 star wars was dubbed in navwajo making at the first major film to be dubed in a native american language .

17702,810,agent_2,"no , but i'm not surprised ."
17703,810,agent_1,apparently she adopts a southern rrawl when ampaigning in southern states .
17704,810,agent_2,that i did know . what i didn't know was that taylor swif tis taller than kanye .
17705,810,agent_1,"kanye is an interesting character . he bel,ieves that aids is a man mad edisease ."
17706,810,agent_2,"i know , i didn't know taht evel knievel suedh im though ."
17707,810,agent_1,do you know what he was sued for ?
17708,810,agent_2,damage to his reputation from ' touch the sky '
17709,810,agent_1,kanye can be nice sometimes . he once gave a mic to a fan in a wheelchair at a concert .
17710,810,agent_2,"i head about that , i didn't now he was 41 though ."
17711,810,agent_1,"well , he has accompliehed a lot in those years , and has been responsible for cultural movements and progressions within hip hop ."
17712,810,agent_2,i didn't know that he incorporqted gospel in some of his sogns .
17713,810,agent_1,thsat's cool . i also liek how eclectic his musijc is .
17714,810,agent_2,"yeah , i do too . it is pretty interesting ."
17715,810,agent_1,"do youl ike music in the minor key ? one of kanye's most successful songs , gold digger , is in the minor key ."
17716,810,agent_2,"i actually play a lot of music . i hear dthat kayne barely plays in minor keys , sort of surprising to me ."
17717,810,agent_1,"i kind of li,e how surpising kanye can be . have you heard of dravon energy ?"
17718,810,agent_2,"he's a lot more int5esting , that's for sure ."
17719,810,agent_1,"yeah , i am not really sure what dragon energy is but kanye has been tweeting abou tit ."
17720,810,agent_2,"i'm not sure either , he should make a soft drink dcalled that ! lol"
17721,810,agent_1,"well , that would be interesting but probably not surprising in the scope of what kanye does , haha !"
17722,811,agent_1,"hi , how are you ? who would you vote vor , hillary or kanye ?"
17723,811,agent_2,kanye west for sure ! no more gold diggers . what about you ?
17724,811,agent_1,i would want them on the same ticket . they could reledase duets and make a ton of cash .
17725,811,agent_2,i would love all the kanye conspiracy theories when he's in office . he believes that ai9ds is a manmade disease .
17726,811,agent_1,i figure ghat hye could go into the secret files and fincd outa bout area 51 an dthe aids conspiracy . the aliens brought aids .
17727,811,agent_2,haah . do you remember hin on tv during thath urricane katrina telethon years bakc ?
17728,811,agent_1,um ot really . did he say some crazy stuff ? did he say the govt caused the hurricane ?
17729,811,agent_2,oh yea . he said ' georg ebush doesn't care about black people ' on live tvf .
17730,811,agent_1,"well , that would make sense from his pint of view . the hurricane devastated the place and there was little ehlp ."
17731,811,agent_2,"true . ij hindsight , it actually doesn't sound crazy at all . do you remember when kanye interrupted taylor swift ?"
17732,811,agent_1,he busted on stage and grabbed the mic . that was crazy . maybe he could be president one day ?
17733,811,agent_2,i tjink you have to be slightly crazy to be president . like hwo actualpy wants to be president .
17734,811,agent_1,i think kanye wpuld want to have trump as his running mate .
17735,811,agent_2,he could get rid of mik epence . trump and kanye 2020 ?
17736,811,agent_1,"kanye and trump , 2020 . kanye don't playt hat . hne ain't vp ."
17737,811,agent_2,"oh man . i dob't know if trump would be down to be vp , especially after being the p . they might have a conflict ."
17738,811,agent_1,"maybe tump would do it if it meant he'd have more free time , maybe to play gofl ."
17739,811,agent_2,"as much as trump woudl li,e that it's bad for his brand . he wants to make his brandn ame more valuable . most of net worth is attributed to te value of his name ."
17740,811,agent_1,"true . he could plut a trump xign om the guest house and rent it out . anywag , great chat !"
17741,811,agent_2,"i think he would like to put a trujp sign everywhere . kanye mihgt like it too , since he wears that hat everywher4 . take care !"

17746,812,agent_1,"yeah , it was actuqlly pretty good and apparently good enough for someone think that india could take lessons from it . lol"
17747,812,agent_2,"yes , i tend td oubt the film amkers were trying to rekind africa and india of their ehared past ."
17748,812,agent_1,hahahaaa . . you never know ! the isnpirati9ons has to come from somewhere !
17749,812,agent_2,i suppose . 9 did think it was interesting marvel studios put up their characters ws collateral . if it hadn't bene successful merril lynch mibght have been making fhese movies
17750,812,agent_1,true ! theb lack panther is the richest super hero .
17751,812,agent_2,is he ? richer than bruce wayne ? or is tjhat a separate universe
17752,812,agent_1,it just says superhero . . . says tony stark is worth 100 milliona nd black panther is 500 million . maybe they are talking about marvel
17753,812,agent_2,maybe . and b;ack panther was the 18th marvel 7universe film . i guess most of them have escaped my notice
17754,812,agent_1,maybw ! wioudl rather 2atch a disney movie or a marvel movie ?
17755,812,agent_2,"umm , xisney i suppose . but really i lind of tend to think o fthem wll ask ids movies anymore . just a sign or getting old i guess"
17756,812,agent_1,oh that's so true ! yoy see frozen was the first disney film to be directed by women ?
17757,812,agent_2,i did kind of like froze n. sad that it took that long to get a femaelp director .
17758,812,agent_1,"well , i guess it's better alte than never . like early to the table is the toy industry taking advantage of putting toyw out before a film i sreleased"
17759,812,agent_2,"well we've got to hook the little kide , parents are where the money is no ?"
17760,812,agent_1,yes they are ! geez . . . wreck it ralph developmengt started back in the 80s
17761,812,agent_2,"i don't remember if i ever saw the original juhngle book , but its very funny that the four vultureas weres upposed to be voicedb y teh beatles"
17762,812,agent_1,did not know that ! lion king was dubebd in zulu for afria
17763,812,agent_2,interesting . i'd love to hear ' circle ov life ' sung in zulu
17764,812,agent_1,"so would i . . . probably on youtube . . been a good hcat , thanks q"
17765,813,agent_1,what's up ? bave you seen blac kpanther yet ? it was directed by ryan coogler who is pretty good
17766,813,agent_2,"i did see the movie . i'm a fan of danai gurira , she's great . i htough the movie wae pretty good ."
17767,813,agent_1,"y4s , cahdwick boseman as tc'hallaw as an ecellent choice"
17768,813,agent_2,"i know , he was good too . i thought it was funny how the wome nkind of took over he movie though . they really stole the show . i was impress3d with the whole cast . i twas surprising how well the movie djid at the box office . one billion is nothing to sneeze at . incredible ."
17769,813,agent_1,yes i especiallg enjoyed et8tia wrihgt's performance
17770,813,agent_2,"didn't she lay the tech genius sister ? teah , i thought her character was very likable and funny . i enjoyed th4 wardrobe . their outfits were amazing and beautiful . they really put a lot into it . i thought tge clothing seemed a little different from what i'm used to seeing . now i see the indian influence ."
17771,813,agent_1,funny thing about black pahther is the censored ' praise hnauman ! ; in the indiajn version
17772,813,agent_2,"6es , i can understand why tehy wer ebeing so careful about it . i thougth it was funny how they thought the indian people would be ofended by the villain lraising one of tyeir deitues but they felt the opposite way . i guess it would be empowering to hear that . utat whole ' black leopard ' tning just sounds crazy . i'm gald they didn't change the name ."
17773,813,agent_1,"ye ,t he character was created before the b.ack panther party was formed"
17774,813,agent_2,"right , but i'm sure a lot of people don't know that and may have taken issue . i never made the connection between the two myself . hwat i find the most interestihg about the story is that black panther is hte richest superhero . you have to have an incredible imagination t put all those details into a character like that .t he background information isf ascinating ."
17775,813,agent_1,"yep , black panther is the richest superhero , he has more money than bruce wayne and tony stark"
17776,813,agent_2,"yeah , richer than just about anyone real or fictional i woudl guess . i would have guessed bruce wqayne was the ricest superhero but i gaven't really been into marvel untilr ecently . i think it's nice how tehse young actors get to play su0erheros thei parents grew up with . j had no udea they used real historical informztion either . the symbols and written script in the movie dated as far back as the fourth century ! wow !"
17777,813,agent_1,"yea , india an dafr9icah ave nad a lot of cultural exchanges . the sidhdis cane to india in ancient times"
17778,813,agent_2,both countriea have very rich hidtories . i can imagine what would have become of them if they hadn't been invaded and colonized . now both contries have major issues with poverty maong o0tehr things . they were incredibly talented ajnd spiritual . they are now but i just wonder how far they would have come withou5 interfrence . i never knew india ever had the numbner one economy in the world !
17779,813,agent_1,"not only sid india have a great econom , they were also very ,nowledgeable in mathematics , metallurgy , astrohomy , medicine , navigation , water management , and textiles"
17780,813,agent_2,"it's not surprising that india still produces so many mathematicians , engineers , and doctors . centuries later those talents seem to be ingrained culturally . it's amazing that theyh ad such a large university so long ago . the invasion in1 193 didn't stop theid progres saltogether . that's what i can determination !"
17781,813,agent_1,i found it fascinating how many cultures studied astronomy . no tonly dd ancietn indians study it so did ancient babylonians
17782,813,agent_2,hte study of astronomy probably began hwen acient cultures realized they co8ld use it to navigate . i didn't realize there were different brancehs of ast5ronomy . they probably began with observational astron0my and it developed into theorertical as time went on . whent hey realized there was a lot more going on than just lights in the sky . it's all fascinating but probably above my thinking . all that math and theoretical stuff makes my head hurt .
17783,813,agent_1,using astronomy rsearxhers were ab;e to date events such as odysseus taking back the throne of ithaca
17784,813,agent_2,"i really enjoy bistorical informqtion like tyat . it's interdsting that it was described in homer's ' the odyssey ' . apparently it happeend on april 16 , 1178 b . c . it's amazing that they can use astronomy to trakc dates and planet swith mathematical precision !"
17785,813,agent_1,it truly is
17786,814,agent_1,did you see the movie black panther yet ?
17787,814,agent_2,i haven'y but i heard it was really good !
17788,814,agent_1,t5he character is the richest of all the superheros
17789,814,agent_2,i can't believe that the symbosl and written script in the movie date back to the 4th century ! so cool .
17790,814,agent_1,it is ! buts its a shame that many associate the character's name with the black panther party of the 60s
17791,814,agent_2,i thought i twas very cool though that chadwick qwas accepted into a summer theater program at oxford niversity and itr qasf unded by denzel washington ! !
17792,814,agent_1,"i thought he samet hing , it is the xoolest real life story to the movie . denzel once joke that he wanted chadwick to repay the tuition since the movie was such a succesx ."
17793,814,agent_2,do you knoww hat else is a success ?a stronomy . do you knowa n6thing about it ?
17794,814,agent_1,only thing i know about it is what bill nye taught me through the tv when i was a kid
17795,814,agent_2,well it is super awesom e! it's a natural science that studies celestial objects and phenomena .
17796,814,agent_1,astronomy is too omplex for me . i have more of a walt disney kjind of mind . lol
17797,814,agent_2,i lov disney ! what is your favorite movie ?
17798,814,agent_1,lion king
17799,814,agent_2,that was the first disney film to e dubbed int zulu for it safrican release ! !
17800,814,agent_1,i am a huge co;lextor of disney toys . i wish i could get some of th4 prodyctrion samplesf rom the toy companies
17801,814,agent_2,ydah me too ! i love frosen though .
17802,814,agent_1,thats ag ood one too ; its this generations lion king and a instant classc . the sogn helped to catapult that movie too
17803,814,agent_2,yes the soundtrack like kany disney movies helped enhance th efilm ! !
17804,814,agent_1,this was disney's first m9vie with a woman director too .
17805,814,agent_2,that is so encouraging to hear . i aslo can't bleieve that wrecki9tralph productio nin the late 1980's
17806,814,agent_1,tahnks
17807,815,agent_1,hi ! would you like to come to my black panther party ?
17808,815,agent_2,"i do not know . willt here be snack s? if i say glory to hanuman , will you think i trude ?"
17809,815,agent_1,"by on snacks , but with 1 billion earned in global rdvneues , we have a nice budget for drinks ."
17810,815,agent_2,"thats a fair amount of money for drinks . cheers ;. apparently , in india , the censures removed tghe saying gl0ry to hanuman ."
17811,815,agent_1,"well , i say since hanuman is one of the most popuolar gods in india , a party would not be a party without 'em !"
17812,815,agent_2,"i have to confess , i have never seen teh movie . i know that forest whitaker was in it . it was kind of funn7 to see him in star wars a few years ago . the guy is lidk weeds ?"
17813,815,agent_1,his eyes do not point in the same direction . gives him a distincfive look . i woner ifd enzel washington evr helped him out like he did for chd boseman ?
17814,815,agent_2,denzel seems to have helped chad a bit . was chadwick also in star wars as a young lando ? now i am not sure if marvel did the cdnsorship or if it was india .
17815,815,agent_1,"good question . there is much mystery in tnhe stars . . . we might have to muster all of our powers ovf mathematics , physics , and chemistry to explain the iorigin of those stars . . ."
17816,815,agent_2,a lot of interesting things cmad from studying teh stars . ancient babylonian swere no lsouches .
17817,815,agent_1,"bill nye , the science guy and executive dirdector oif the planetary society would agrse with you ."
17818,815,agent_2,i occasionally look at the moo nwith a teelscope . i guess that is called observational astr5onomy . it would be theoretical if i thought about the moon from inside the house .
17819,815,agent_1,i see you a person of much depth and introspectio . you would do well in he iranian town of saada tshhar . that is if you came outside to do your star gazig . . .
17820,815,agent_2,should i bring the telescope to your black panter par6ty ? that iranian town sounds very relaxing .
17821,815,agent_1,"sure ! forrest gump is coming too , and he is bringing shrimp . you may want to bone up on your command of homer's the odyssey . nod oubt the topic of using wastronomy to triangulate the date of odysseus's taking back of the throne of ithaca will be a hot topic ."
17822,815,agent_2,"i am sure it will . if carl sagan shows up , bil ;nye might try and start somethijg . so , there is that ."
17823,815,agent_1,"sagan talks a lot abojt those billions and billions of falaxies . i mean , like , how much is there to say qbout the theoretical and observationalb asis tha tserve as the basi for ones analytical model of interpalnetary bodies ? some of us would like to talk avout football . . ."
17824,815,agent_2,"i am nt sure i would like to talk about football . it is safer than politics though . most o fthe stars we see , they are already dead . burned out long before thei rlight ever reached us . navigating by a dead star is a lost art ."
17825,815,agent_1,so true . and molst movie stars can be described the same way . fyi . did i tell you to come dresed as any disney character ?
17826,815,agent_2,oh that makes it all the more fun . i would like to be ralph a in wreck it . .

17879,818,agent_1,"i am surprised it did not work out . it is good that a movie like black panther can become such a hit . in the 1950s , a federal judge tried to act7ally ban a comic because it featured ab lack character ."

17892,819,agent_1,"well its a great moie , i likerd it , endearing and fun , some of the ratings are unfair but i believe its a good movie"
17893,819,agent_2,well it's been compwred to deadpool and g7rdian of the galaxy which i liked and enjoy so i ecpect it's a pretty funny movie
17894,819,agent_1,"yeah , all three great movies , you should really watch it if you liked deadpool and gurdians of the galaxy , i think marvel comics has done a great johb with the movies"

17901,819,agent_2,"no , i had no clue , i will hav eto be on the lookout then"
17902,819,agent_1,"deadpool described himself as ryan rinolds even before he ws caste dfor the role , tuat was in 2004 ,"
17903,819,agent_2,that's great casting . it turns out james cameron and david finchr really like deadpool's script
17904,819,agent_1,"its a nice script , in fact is the highwst gfossng rrated film odf all time that wasntd irected by either camerobn or lucas"
17905,819,agent_2,"i never knww george lucas directed a r rated movie , i will have to look htat up"
17906,819,agent_1,"ut seems that way , you know that the video game of the movie costed more than the movi eitself !"
17907,819,agent_2,that's crwzy bt i bet it ins' tmore ezpesnive than infinity war . infinity war as hte first film completely shot with imax digital cameras
17908,819,agent_1,"wow , i bet that will start a trend , more movijes wil bef ilmed that way ,"
17909,819,agent_2,"hopeully , the avengers do have a big influence likew when the increased shawarma sales"
17910,819,agent_1,"that is a really cool fact , i guess its because of the eneing scene of the mov8e , all heroes are 8n a shawarma place"
17911,820,agent_1,good morning ! are you a fan of comic books ?
17912,820,agent_2,i do .like su;erheros but i cant say ibve read many comic books .
17913,820,agent_1,i'm th3e same way . did you like teh deadpool movie ?
17914,820,agent_2,i dixd ! he is my favorite superhero . its crazy that the video game cost more to make tha nthe movie
17915,820,agent_1,"it is . i wonder if the video game ended up making more than the move ? in a 2004 comic book , deadpool descriebd himself as ' ryan reynolds crossed with a sharpei ' which le dreynolds to0 beliegve hew asd estined to play the role ."
17916,820,agent_2,he was certainly perfect for it . he is lilely the reason it was the highest grosing film no directed by cameeron o rlucas .
17917,820,agent_1,i agree . did you know that the voice of the mysteryv illain is also ryan reynolds ?
17918,820,agent_2,i didn't . i thought i recognized something there . that explains it . did you see infinity war ?

17920,820,agent_2,wow . tgat ois neat . i missed it in theaters . i hear dit caused a notable increase in shawama sale s.
17921,820,agent_1,interesting . i thought itw as neat that in the movie the avengers and the guardians of the galaxy worked together to stop thanos froma massing the allpowerful infinity stones .
17922,820,agent_2,the ending kille dme .
17923,820,agent_1,"the voice actor who played jarvis , who also played in the ir9n man series , never wa sactually deen in the film . i never noticed hat ."

17930,820,agent_2,"realy , i heard good things about it ."
17931,820,agent_1,i didn't think it deserved that low of a rating . it was nice chatting with you this morning . hop eyou have a good day !
17932,821,agent_1,do you enjoy superhero mofies ?
17933,821,agent_2,"yea , i haven't caught anytman and the wasp yet , i hear it's pretty funny and doesn't tqke itself serious;y"
17934,821,agent_1,well marvel does a good job of injecting humor into its superhero movies nad to me this is a plus
17935,821,agent_2,"yea l i'm inrterested to see how lang and luis running a security firm turns out , ftney were both great in the firs tantman"
17936,821,agent_1,i mean sott lang has fin9ished his house arrest o it seem ;ike he is in foer an adventure
17937,821,agent_2,"yea , i heard pau lrudd rote teh script so it shouldn't dissapoint"
17938,821,agent_1,have you watched any others uperhero films ?
17939,821,agent_2,"yea i've seen most of the marvel movies , it's crazy how big and siuccessful they've gotten sinced isney purchased them in 2009"
17940,821,agent_1,did you enjoy deadpool 2 ?
17941,821,agent_2,"yeza i found it pretty funny , i'm amazed that the deadp9oo; videogame cost more to make than the movie"
17942,821,agent_1,well it was the highese tgrossing r rated film of all time . of course not directed by cameron or lucss
17943,821,agent_2,"that's strange , i didn't know george lucas even directeda nh r rated movie or it wzs one of the highest grossing oens with that rating"
17944,821,agent_1,then did gou enjoy infinity war ?
17945,821,agent_2,yea i saw it a couple weeks after it was released 2018
17946,821,agent_1,it is funny how avengers caused a notable increase in shawarma sales
17947,821,agent_2,"yea i can see how shawarma sales increased , i've never heard of it before the avengers camw out"
17948,821,agent_1,"true i only triwd it once and it was decent , but not too memorabl otherwise . in any case it was a goo movie and the first to entirely be shot with digital imax cameras"
17949,821,agent_2,"yea , too bad jarvis' voice actor has nev4r seen any of the iron mna or avengers movies"
17950,821,agent_1,"that is a shame . if i voiced something in a movie , i woul dwant to see my efforts"
17951,821,agent_2,"yea , i wonder if lou ferrigno watched any of the movies where he voiced the hulk"
17952,821,agent_1,"i mean considering he voiced the chaacter for decades i certainly hope so . 9n any case , it was a pleasure to talk to you about superhero mofies ."
17953,822,agent_1,so do ylu like hsakespeare ? i read that they coined or popularized many of the phrases w euse today .
17954,822,agent_2,this is true . he wrote may plays andw as very poular .
17955,822,agent_1,"some oft he phrases include ' good riddance , i nmy heart of heartrs , laughing stock , nd wild goose chase ."
17956,822,agent_2,those are all classics . did you know he died in 1616 .
17957,822,agent_1,no id i dnot . u read however that pocahontas and him were both alive att he same time and died only a year apart .
17958,822,agent_2,thats interesting . wonder if t6hey ever met each other .
17959,822,agent_1,"that would hav3 been an interestung meet up . i saw tgat shakespeare invented hten ames miranda , jessica , and olivia"
17960,822,agent_2,thats ook . my daughters name i solivia and my sisters name is jessica . thanks shakspeare
17961,822,agent_1,i also just ead tha tpolish composer tchaikowskjy donated his skull to the royal shakespeare company
17962,822,agent_2,guess he wants it to be used in a play or something .
17963,822,agent_1,yes he wa shoping it would be used a s prop for teh skull of yorick
17964,822,agent_2,i guess that woul be one way to live on .
17965,822,agent_1,i tactually ended up beign used in a series of performances of hamlet at the courtyard tgheater
17966,822,agent_2,i think hamlet is the more popular of the two anyways .
17967,822,agent_1,"yes , 'm sure . thdy say that his wodks take on a different msanin gwhen performed wuith an eraappropriate accent"
17968,822,agent_2,i ould see that . play it for thet ime when he wrote it nd it makes more srnse . makes sense to me .
17969,822,agent_1,so off subjecf but what do you think about the piano . it was invented in italy by bartolomeo cristofori around 1700
17970,822,agent_2,i kind of wish i could play it .
17971,822,agent_1,"m too ! this is interestjng on april 1 8, 19w30 the bbc decided that there was no news worth reporting so theyb roadcast pinao music instead"
17972,822,agent_2,how many people never listened to that station again after htat . lol .
17973,822,agent_1,"yes , exactly it was an interesting cuoice ."

17975,823,agent_2,i have not actually . did you ? are they any good ?

17977,823,agent_2,"i lik deadpook too , ryan retnolxd sis so good in that"
17978,823,agent_1,he is . i am not sure how i feel about paul rudd as ant man . he just doesn't seem like a superhero to me .
17979,823,agent_2,yeah that isw interesting . did you know deadpool described himself s ryan reynol crossed with a sharpei ?
17980,823,agent_1,no i had not heard that . di dyou know that the deadpool video gaemc ost more to make than the movie ? crazy !
17981,823,agent_2,"that is crazy . yeah , and that was before ryan was even fcat"
17982,823,agent_1,are you into comics ? i forgot that disney acquired marvel in 2009 . it seems like disney has a piec of everything !
17983,823,agent_2,they sure do . apparently the voce of the mystery villain deadpool is rytan himself
17984,823,agent_1,"i heard that . surprising . one thing is that disney doesn't own the rightst o the ' big ' chararcters like avengers , xemn , spiderman due to a contract that marvel aigned wit universal studios ."
17985,823,agent_2,"wow , tnat is amazing . did you know son6 hadt he chance to buy all the superero rights from marvle and passed on it ?"
17986,823,agent_1,"wasn't it something to do wit them only wanting rights to spiderman , thinking that movie audiences just cared bout spiderman . that was a mistake ."
17987,823,agent_2,yeah they got spiderman only for 10 million
17988,823,agent_1,marvel also created a superhero called blue ear who wore hewring aids for a 4 year old boy who didn'tl ike wearibg his hearing aids . he had told his mom that supdrehros don'tw ear hearing aids . well so marvel created one ! pretty cool .
17989,823,agent_2,that is so heartwarming . good fo rthem . have you heard of access ?
17990,823,agent_1,"nko , what is it ?"
17991,823,agent_2,wa superhero that keeps the universes of marvel and dc separate
17992,823,agent_1,"oh , for a second here i thpught you meant to type the avengers . who i have ehard of . i mean hp eoesn't like a movi ewith ronert downey jr . , chris helmsworth , mark r8ffalo and benedict cumberbatch ?"
17993,823,agent_2,yeah taht is a great movie for sure . it wzas the first movie to be shotw ith digital imax cameras entirely
17994,823,agent_1,i love digital imax movies . well it waws nice talking to you . hope you get to see a good superhero movie soon . this has made me want to o to hte movies .
17995,823,agent_2,"same here , have a good one ."
17996,824,agent_1,"how's it going , have you read any shakespeare ? it's kinda strange that no one know the exact xate of his birth"
17997,824,agent_2,hi how arr you ? i wonder how good the birht records were back in those days .
17998,824,agent_1,"not too good , the best record they have for zhakespeare is h8s baptism in 1564"
17999,824,agent_2,"he lived a full life . i wonder how many hour sa day he wrote . h ewas the most rolific writer ever , i imagine ."
18000,824,agent_1,"yea shakespeare d9d right a lot , 39 plays and 154 sonbnets"
18001,824,agent_2,"man , that is al o tof play writing . two or htree a year , i guess . actors must have loved him . steady aork !"
18002,824,agent_1,"you know shakespeare was an actor for a few years , i never knew thbat"
18003,824,agent_2,"i did not know taht , but it makes sense . i guess his experinece shaped his thinking as a playwrite ."
18004,824,agent_1,"yea , i never knew he had 3 childrn either and married a lady name asnne hathaway , 8i wonder ift he kids inherited anything after he pssed"
18005,824,agent_2,"that is unlikely . bot , that would be tough to be his kid . a long shadow the father would cast ."
18006,824,agent_1,"yea , shakespeared id coin popular phrases like ' good riddance ' and ' laughing stock '"
18007,824,agent_2,and i bet audiences immediately understood the meaning o0f tose phrases . he could have gotten rich today coining slogans for adver4tisi8ng . lol
18008,824,agent_1,"shaekspeare could ofa lso trademark the names he inventede like miranda , jessica , and olivia"
18009,824,agent_2,"those ar eclassic names , and very popular in england . i guess that those characters had distinct personalities as well ."
18010,824,agent_1,"yea , it's craay how sakespeares writing takes on dofferent meaning depending on the eraappropriate accent i sused"
18011,824,agent_2,i cant even imagine how many accents would be involve d. bewildering .
18012,824,agent_1,"i guess that's the good thing about playign a piano , no accetns . crazy it was inventsd all the way bwck in 1700"
18013,824,agent_2,the piano has developed so much over the years . a wonderful instrument . universal .
18014,824,agent_1,"yea , it's pretty cool the same piano was use xto record ' hey jude ' and ' bohemian rhpsody '"
18015,824,agent_2,"i bet there is some maic in those keys . any2ay , great cha5 !"
18016,824,agent_1,"you too , have a good one"
18017,825,agent_1,"hello , how are you . are you a movie fan ? hab eyou seen deadpool 2 ?"
18018,825,agent_2,i watch movie once in a while . you ?
18019,825,agent_1,"i am a huge movie or marvel fan . in deadpool 2 , there is za scene where deadpool klls ryan reynodls , who plays deadpool , ."
18020,825,agent_2,i have not watched the movie . but i know that the deadpool viseogame cost moret o mak4 tha the deadpool the movie
18021,825,agent_1,"oh my god , really ? ? ? that is crazy . deadpool has made more money than any other r rted movie m not directed by james cameron o rgeorte lucas ."
18022,825,agent_2,"i am a fan of george lucas , and thi safact really ads to my surprisinbg"
18023,825,agent_1,"james cameron who is friends with tim mille r, who directed deadpool , read the script and helped push the film on fox executives ."
18024,825,agent_2,"btw , do you know that the voice of the mystery vil,ain in deadpool 2 is fyan reynolds"
18025,825,agent_1,"i had saw that somewhere . man , sony screwed up big time . in 1998 , marv3l offered the cinematic rights of almost all of its cahracters to sony for a jere 25 million . sony rejected the offer , and only purchased the rights to spiderman fo 10 million believing that movie audiences would 0only care about him . what a mistake"
18026,825,agent_2,ic oncur . i do not know what really happened to sony . thei rbusiness and reputation is almost gone on the market
18027,825,agent_1,access is a character owned by marvel and dc . the characters sole purpose is to keep marvel and dc universes seperate . lol
18028,825,agent_2,"i know , it is hilaroous . b7y any cahnce , have you watched avengers : infinity war . it was very good"
18029,825,agent_1,i have seen it like 10 times . this is funny ! marvel had a court battle and successfully argue dtha ttoys ' instead oft he higehr rate for dolls because they are not human .
18030,825,agent_2,"wow , you watched it 10 times . you must like it a lot . did you know htat the avengers : ifninity war is the first fim ever to be shot entirelty with digital imax cameras"
18031,825,agent_1,i think i read that somewuere . i read a very good story awhile back . marvel made up a superhero called blue ear solely for a 4 year old boy who didn't lik wearing his hearing aids
18032,825,agent_2,i think this tact is very believable . and it is a cute story also .
18033,825,agent_1,that made me like marvel even bettdr . i also think it's funny that shawarma sales went up after th eavengers movie
18034,825,agent_2,do you thinl it was a coincidence or were they somehow related
18035,825,agent_1,it wa all due to the show . the actor who voices jarvis has never actually been seen in the films .
18036,825,agent_2,"got it . also , did you know that sdeadpool described himnself s ' ryan reynolds crossed with a sharpei in a 2004 comic book seriesw , whihc led to the fact that reynodlb elieved he wasd estined for the role"
18037,825,agent_1,"well , it has bene great chatting . merry christmas ."
18038,826,agent_1,did you study shakespeare in school ?
18039,826,agent_2,"no , i did no . did you ?"
18040,826,agent_1,"i remember romeo and juliet plays . he actually invented the names , jessica ,m iranda , and olivia ."
18041,826,agent_2,that's cool !
18042,826,agent_1,"yeah , did y9u ever watch the moviw pocahontas ?"
18043,826,agent_2,wure did . i rad they were both alive at the same time andd ied within a year of each other .
18044,826,agent_1,"yeah , i found that out recnetly . i never knew pocahontas was a eeal person ."
18045,826,agent_2,really ?
18046,826,agent_1,"yeah , i bad no idea . i'm not sure who this is but , a polish composer andre tchaikoqsky donated his sku,l to hsakespeare . anre hoped he would use it as a prop ."
18047,826,agent_2,it got ueed in a seies of performances o fhamlet at the courtyard yheatre .
18048,826,agent_1,"well , that is awesome , i guess he did ge twhat he wanted ."
18049,826,agent_2,i guess ?t hey say shakespeare's works take n a differebt meanimg when performed with an era appropriate accent instead of a moderm one . i think i'd likde to watch and listen to one .
18050,826,agent_1,"i would too ., i wonder if he coulds plwy piano ?"
18051,826,agent_2,"he amy hve , he seemed very talented . can you play piano ?"
18052,826,agent_1,"not t all , i liked to think i could as a child though . can you ?"
18053,826,agent_2,"actually , i trained for 13 years and i' mpretty gooeda t it ? k read somewhere ghat the bbc decided tnat there was no news worth reporting on april 18 . 1930 , so they played pianom usic instead . i wish america's media would take that cue some days ."
18054,826,agent_1,"oh wow , thgat is awesome . i believe i read this sonewhere . a griup of climbers , climbed the tallest mountain in brtain and there was a piano ont he top !"
18055,826,agent_2,i wonder how it got there ? very interesting .
18056,826,agent_1,"i have no idea , do you think itw orked stil l?"
18057,826,agent_2,"probab,ly not , pianos are very fickle instruments . lll"
18058,826,agent_1,i'm sure you kmow wh0 freddie mercury is . he used the same piano as paul mccartney to record bohejmian rhapsodyu .
18059,826,agent_2,"that's coo l. well , it's bene nice chztting , i have to go now . i'll tal kto you alter , friend ."
18060,827,agent_1,are you a fan of any forms of ar t?
18061,827,agent_2,yes ! i enjoy ar5 in the form of music . i especilly enjoy the tune of the4 piano . what about you ?
18062,827,agent_1,"i lov piano music , and music in gejeral . i actually played piano when i was a kid . do you play any instruments ?"
18063,827,agent_2,"oh wow , what age did you start and do y9ou still play ? ho i do not play any instrumebts , i wished i played the guitar ."
18064,827,agent_1,"i started when i was six and played until i was seventeen , nut then we moved and i had to give up my piano . haven't palyed since , sadly , but i loved it . maybe you should ty guitar !"
18065,827,agent_2,"oh no ! that's terribl e! piano sound sare beautiful , what made yous tart lewrning the instrument ? i have givent he guitar a frew tries , but without the foundation of music , it is so difficult to play . i admire those selftaught people ."
18066,827,agent_1,"it was actually my mom's idea seh wanted us all to learn an isntrument ,s o she bpought us a piano and some books and taugh tus at home . i know what you mean about not having a foundation of music . i felt so cl.umsy and lueless starting out ."
18067,827,agent_2,"wow ! i really want my ids to play na instrument and would love them to learn the piano , were you apprehensive to it at first ? i don't want to force m kids butw hen ih ear baout the statistics of the benefits classical muhsic , i really want my kiss to learn it ."
18068,827,agent_1,"it wasn't really intimidating since i started so youngt . it was just anohter thing to learn , lik math or english , and it was fun too . what kid doesn't like making noise ? it also helped that my mom let me play on my own in hetwe ninstructional periods ."
18069,827,agent_2,"great insight ! that's very true , what scares me is ask8ng these kids to sit ajd focus tyeir attention on it . thankw for the ifno ! i can't believe that there is a piano at the top oc britain's higghest mountain ! would the keys still function if ig snowed ? !"
18070,827,agent_1,"as long asd the pino stays closed s9 snow doesn't clog the chords inside , it probably would play just fine . unless it's an eoectric piano . then i think snow might cause some electrical issues !"
18071,827,agent_2,"oh wow ! thatsd' super neat . do you enjoy poetry ? so many people speculated bout shakespeares' sexuality , whatever it was , he wrote some great ieces ."
18072,827,agent_1,"i love poetry . i've read some of shakespeare'ss onnets , and his plqys ! , , an dthey haves uch creative , lyrical beaut5y . i diden't know there was zpeculation about his sexuality , just that he was married to anne hathaway ."
18073,827,agent_2,i wondered if the celebrity anne hathaway's name is inspired from that . i had no idea pocahontas and shakespeare were alve at thes ame time ! they would've semed to .ive in different eras to me .
18074,827,agent_1,pocahontas and shakespeare being contemporaries is surprising l think about . i had the same surprisedd reaction to finding ou gane frank and martin luther king jr . were born in the same year .
18075,827,agent_2,yeah ! what ? ! that's crazy ! is there a particular piece of work yo7u enjoy of shakespeare's ?
18076,827,agent_1,"my favorite play f his is hmalet , with mzcbeth a close runnerup . i can't say i have a favorite sonnet , tbough . each has its unique appeal . do youy hae a favorite ?"
18077,827,agent_2,"yeah , thosxe are really good ones . i don't typicallyh ave a fagvorife but enjoyed each one of them . i also find it interesting that he invented the names miranda , jessica , and olivia , those are really commom names niwadays !"
18078,827,agent_1,olivia is one of te names my brother and hi swife are considering using fo rtheir new baby if i6 ends up ebing az girl . i'll have to tell my brother he has shakespeare to thank !
18079,827,agent_2,that's wonderful ! all the olivia's i havce kno nin my lif eare stunning and gorgeous ! it really matches the name ! what type of name is in th ename bank if it is w boy ?
18080,827,agent_1,"my brother wants to name it after him , but my sisterinlw prefrs jackson . i like her idea better !"
18081,828,agent_1,h9i
18082,828,agent_2,hi ! how are you ? hav eyou seen the ne3 deadpool sequel yet ? i hear its amazing .
18083,828,agent_1,"no i haven't been able to see it y4t . the first one was great , but i haven't been able to seet he secnd yet ."
18084,828,agent_2,"i'm not usually so into super hero stuff . but there a4re so manyg reatf movies coming out , i can't help 8it . have you seen infinity war ? its the first fil mto ever be shot entirely with imaz cameras !"
18085,828,agent_1,"i haven't yet . i ebt that' spretty intense . tyerea re a ton of actpr in it ; almost too much to folloe . i guess that's why they needed the imax cameras , huh ?"
18086,828,agent_2,"i guess so , i guess the voice actor that 0lays iron man has never ever see nbthe movies ."
18087,828,agent_1,"actually , the cahracter jarvis hasn't been in the film s.b ut that's a bit of a fib because jarvis becomes vision and is played by the same actor , paul bettany"
18088,828,agent_2,"that' sinterestign , thanks for clearing that up . did you know that disney isn't allowed to show big marvelp characters ezst of the mississippid uet o a contract they signed ?"
18089,828,agent_1,it's kind of funny how the ownership of the marvel properties wo5ks . s0onys till owns spiderman so eh only shows up if sony let's disneu have him . this is why hus appearacnes in iron man and avengers are really short .
18090,828,agent_2,htat's so weird . the creatsd a characte rcalled blue ear for a little boy who was afraid to wear his hearign aids and told his mom ' but super heroea don't w4ar hearing aids . ' so marvel made one that did . so sweet .
18091,828,agent_1,"yeah , overalkl they really care about tehir fans . an dthere are al ot o fthem a6 this point . did you know there are over 19 films in hte marvel cinematic univese ? and more every year !"
18092,828,agent_2,"j had no idea . i didn't even realize there er eso many characters until not too long ago . i didn' watch of read comic books w2hne i was a kid , so i was only familiar with superma nand batman . i had never heard of deadpool , black panther , xoctor strange , or any of those guys . i bet sony wishes they had taken marvel up on their offer to buy them out for 25 million . i think sony thought pepplew puld only care about spiderman ."
18093,828,agent_1,"i think at the time , theyw ere right . the mcu didn't really take off until iron man in 2008 . still , i bet someone at sony got yelelc at for that one ."
18094,828,agent_2,what';s the deal with that character acess ?; i head that he is oaned by both compsnies and his ob is solly tom ak edsure tha hte two companies' universes separate ?
18095,828,agent_1,"i don't know , but its too bad we couldn't see a dc or marvel cross over . superman meets fhe avengers ? sign me up ."
18096,828,agent_2,"i bet that wouldr be fun . myh usband and son would love it if they did that . i guess marvel argued successfully in court that mutants wrre not people , and so theyg ot to pay the lower rate on xmen toys instea of the higher rate for dolls .s o much interesting trivia ."
18097,828,agent_1,that's kind of ironic considerign much of the xmen story is about how mutant sare the same a shumans and deservge equality .
18098,828,agent_2,"ha , that is ironic . i was tinking that that might send a weird message to htekr fhildf ans ."
18099,828,agent_1,"i think people overthink what children mihgt think . however , i think there are certain characters that just aren ot for kids . like dseadpool . the merc with a miuth . it was really a good thing they rate it r ."
18100,828,agent_2,that's what husband said . i guess the first one was the highest grossing r rated featur eof all time after rhe passion of the christ . my husband said i tdefinitely wasn'y a kids movgie .
18101,828,agent_1,"i heard 2 takes it even further with the crudeness . i enjoyed the first one , it definitely didn't hold back , but it also didn't feel forced . just felt like this is the character and this is the life he leadsw hich is full of sex , violence , and swearing ."
18102,828,agent_2,"i used to think that kind of thing was funny , but now that j'm getting old4 rit seems very distasteful to me .l i guess i probably just don't wanf myk id saying stuff like thnat . i thought superheroes were upposed to be for kids . although , i guess maybe the movies are fkr the people htat used to be kids ."
18103,828,agent_1,"maybe that 8s the appeal of someone like deadpool . he's a superhero , but he's not for kids . they are probably trying to capture a whole new audjience that doesn't iljde kirs ."
18104,828,agent_2,"that makes more sense . kids don't have any money , you have to get the parents roped back in if you want them to buy the kids all the expensive toys and movies and stuff . unless they're mutant toys , gecause those are cheaper ."
18105,828,agent_1,htey also have been doing on so lon that they have a nice audience of ylung adults hwo grew up with all th emarvel movies that they can now afford to buy a lot of useless ' toys ' themselves .
18106,828,agent_2,yup . my husband ah sa bigger collection of superhero stuff htan he probably efer did when he was a kid . they must make so much off of merchandise alone .
18107,828,agent_1,their licenwing department really went crazy . but people buy it so maybe not .
18108,828,agent_2,"i read the avengers caused a motable increas ein sawarma sales , why would that be , do you know ?"
18109,828,agent_1,"i think they mak ea big point of eating it at some point . kt really shows how big of an impact the mcu has , uh ?"
18110,828,agent_2,"it really does , lil"
18111,828,agent_1,i don't think you get to be almost 20 films strong and not have at least some influence on society .
18112,828,agent_2,"no , i don't suppose you do . people are so into the shows and movies they watch these days . its kind of crazy ."
18113,829,agent_1,"hello , do ypu watch arvel movies ?"
18114,829,agent_2,i do . i've pretty much seen the all nad i consider myself a fan . you ?
18115,829,agent_1,i ahve watchex most of them . which one is your favorite ?
18116,829,agent_2,i would have to say thor . i think they cas tit perfectly with chris hemsworth too l what's your favorite ?
18117,829,agent_1,"i8 also enjoy thor altough i really did lik einfinity war . did youk jow that abnt an made his debt before spiderman , thor and even hulk ;"
18118,829,agent_2,i've heard that . did you see ant ma ninteresting to sede paul rudd as a super hero lol
18119,829,agent_1,agreed . the infinity gauntlet w3as originally on thor's left hand in the comics but was originally right hajnded .
18120,829,agent_2,did you ze the first infinity wars movie ?
18121,829,agent_1,"i have , i rewlly enjoyed it . it was nice to see all of the marvel characters come together . have you ?"
18122,829,agent_2,"i di d. since half of tehm disappeared , how d you think it's goin gto end ? i hav ea feeling antmn is involved ."
18123,829,agent_1,"yeah , ant man was shown with a machgine in hte trziler . i believe that they are going to travel hack in time to fox their mistakes ."
18124,829,agent_2,"that eould be pretty cool . i wonder if captsin marvel will figre in ,. what do you think ?"
18125,829,agent_1,"possibly . i have recently watched that movis as well , a great addition to the marvel universe ."
18126,829,agent_2,oh really already ; that just came out friday right ? ! i ahven't had the chance yet but want to .
18127,829,agent_1,"yeah , i booekd some tickets and went to watch it yesterday . don't waorry , i will not spoil anything ;"
18128,829,agent_2,"haha okay . you can spoil one hting though , were any other characters from tbe marvel universe in it ?"
18129,829,agent_1,"wel l, i do not have the exact number but there weee at leadt two ,"
18130,829,agent_2,which two ? !
18131,829,agent_1,"iron man , briefly , and hulk"
18132,829,agent_2,that's awesome . i can't wait tos ee it . crazy how disney owns marvek ntertainment now . except in tehme parksl ol
18133,829,agent_1,"haha , yep . anyways , thank you for your time ! it was nicw chatting with you !"
18134,829,agent_2,thank you as well . have a great night !
18135,829,agent_1,you too !
18136,830,agent_1,hi ! are you current with all the marvel movies ?
18137,830,agent_2,"some of them . i loved thor ragnarok and black panther , but some ogf tehm are a little dull . what about you ?"
18138,830,agent_1,"i am way behind . 9 haven'tg even seen iroj an 2 yet , although i did watch the first thor movie . . . i am interested 9n watching them , but oncxe yo fall behind , the numbes mount quickly !"
18139,830,agent_2,"and tehy're all conected ! i resd an article pinting out th plot points that culminated in aventers : infinity wa rand it ble wmym ind . that one has quite a cast of impressive actors . i'd never iagined idris elba and paul bettany in supedheri movies , vut hte mcu is a whoe different beast ."
18140,830,agent_1,i would agre totally . there have been like 19 mcu movies in 5hs last ten years . . . that's two pef y4ar 2
18141,830,agent_2,"i have friends that have watched them all . i can't imagine having the time to dot hat ! th fact that they're now releasing htem so quickly and closet ogether really keeps the excitement up . the last 3 movies that came out did better than previous titles ,k and i wonder if they're going to keep doing thatj ust to keep ticket sales booming ."
18142,830,agent_1,"as long as htere are sur4fire to be made , hollywood will invest . and with th enoticeable tredn that pushing through one great story fter another yie,ds steqdy revenues , i think i will stay far behind . . ."
18143,830,agent_2,"d9 watch thor : ragnarok . 'ts so much fun . it's a different tone than most super hero movies , because the director , taika waititi let 6the cast improvise . it's very loose and enormously fun ."
18144,830,agent_1,that sounds vreat ! was ragnorok the second or third in hte thor series ?
18145,830,agent_2,"it was the second . i think . i might be wrong , but it' sdefinitely the most memoragble one for me . i do nejoy tom hiddleston as loki . cahn yoh umagin eif he would have eben cast as thor ? i an'r get my head around that ."
18146,830,agent_1,"after watching the first thor ovie , 011 , ic annot imagine l9ki adn thor any different than hwo played them . what else can you tell me about this ? abou"
18147,830,agent_2,"well , in fhinking agout it , ragnarok wast he tird movie in the thor series . i had forgotten yhe second onee ntirely ! hiddleston put on 50 pounds of muscle to play thor , and i would like to see what thst oloks like on him . apparently he screen tested , so it's got to be on the internet someqwhere !"
18148,830,agent_1,really ? what is the infinity gauntlet ?
18149,830,agent_2,"it's theg lovelike thibg that htanos collects the infinity stones into . th stones are hidden all around the universe and once he has them , he can wreak havoc on mankind . theh'r esort of hidden in all of the mcu moviee , in one way or another ."
18150,830,agent_1,"bizarre , but interesting ! i remember wayching lal the xmen movi8e s, and really connecting wth the humanity of the mutant cdharacterz . is then hsocked me when i learned that marvel successfully argued in court that mutants are not people in orde rto reduce cost of producing xmen toys . seems ironid !"
18151,830,agent_2,"right ? ! it's kind of antixmen , becauss theya re people ! i'd love to have a great x men movie sometime . i'd love it if they were addedt o the mcu , because there are some excellent xmen characters . it's weird that in orlando , there are lots of marvel chqracters at disney world , bu tsome of them are only at universal studios ."
18152,830,agent_1,"yeah , strange to have ' rights 't o imaginaru figures . . . maybe that is one reason why sony blaked at the chance to buy cinematic rights to moet of the marvel characters for a mere 25 mil ."
18153,830,agent_2,they have to be kikcing themselves ! and then they spnet 10 million only on spiderman ' ! there are such good stories to be told that are already written in teh comics !
18154,830,agent_1,"yeah . son any characters and so many stories , it is not surprising that the marvel and dc created a character , access , htat straddles the two reality to hekp them to keep track of and keep separate the two universes . if they need help keeping this st8fv straight , i have't got a chance !"
18155,830,agent_2,"i rsmemberr when he was created they dis a crosaover between ,arvel and dc . it was a clever idea . i know i'd watch a movie about blueear , the superhero who wears hearing aids ."
18156,830,agent_1,"yeah . i would even watch a movie abouit jarvis ! you know , the actor who voiced thw jarvis rol ein iron man and infinity ewars has nbever seen the films . maybe i cna get him to take me and we can catch up on these films together ? nice chatting with you !"
18157,831,agent_1,"hi , have you seen thge movie ' black panther , if yes , did you like it ?"
18158,831,agent_2,"i did enhoy the film , lathough not as much as avenger s: infinity war with its record breajing opening ."
18159,831,agent_1,"i didn't like it as much either , do you knoe howb lack panther is partly responsible fo rsudcess of avengers : infinity war ?"
18160,831,agent_2,"hard to say for sure , but opening 10 weeks priopr may have helped the big film's succeed ."
18161,831,agent_1,did you kno avengers : infinity war made more money than star wars ?
18162,831,agent_2,i heard that !2 50 million is a lot of money !
18163,831,agent_1,"yes , have you sesn iron man , if yes did you like it ?"
18164,831,agent_2,ye . even after ten years it holds upl quite well !
18165,831,agent_1,"that's true , i even like the actor in iron man as much as teh movie itsel f. he is one of my favorite actor ."
18166,831,agent_2,do you know the naje of hte company that published iron manc omics ?
18167,831,agent_1,"njo , i am not sure , do youk now or have ant idea ? i kenw teh artist i think , because i like drawing cartoons ."
18168,831,agent_2,"i believe it was mrvel comics group , sincd they talk about the marvel cinemati cuniverse ."
18169,831,agent_1,"do you hve a favorite comic hero , if yes , who is your favorite ?"
18170,831,agent_2,"i like the xmen because they are mutants , not people ."
18171,831,agent_1,"i like xmen also with so many djfferent powers , but my favorite is the oncredible hulk ."
18172,831,agent_2,"did you know ant man came before thor , hulk and spiderman !"
18173,831,agent_1,"what do you mean , that ant man mase more money ? i saw ant man i like it . i was surprise at first , but teh movie was really good ."
18174,831,agent_2,"no , the character was created before the others . interesting given the role of thokr in the avengers ."
18175,831,agent_1,"oh reoly , i didn't know that . i need to follow comics mors closely ."
18176,831,agent_2,everyone should ! teh avengers movie even resulted in an increase in shawarma sales due to the brief scene !
18177,831,agent_1,"back to black panthr , i was really surprised the many awards this movie won ."
18178,831,agent_2,surely sometbing no one would have seen when marvel started in 1939 !
18179,831,agent_1,"that's true , did you kno win 1961 the fantastic rour was created ?"
18180,831,agent_2,stan lee and stev ditko were geniuses in their own way ! thanks for teh chat .
18181,832,agent_1,have you seen thor ?
18182,832,agent_2,hi how are you ? i have not seen thor ?
18183,832,agent_1,"i've seen it . the first one is good , the secomd one , not som uch ."
18184,832,agent_2,"i don treally like the superhero films . too many explosions , too many battle scenes . it gets old ."
18185,832,agent_1,"yeah , they get old really qu8ick . i'm n the same camp . i did like how theb atmans with bale were done though . what about you ?"
18186,832,agent_2,"i did like bale's batman . and i also like spiderman 2 ; more story , less cg stuff ."
18187,832,agent_1,"yeah , they were good . i think it is mostoly the marvel films that are getting old ."
18188,832,agent_2,"yeah , i think that a bunch are slated to come out over hte next few years . i will taje a pass ."
18189,832,agent_1,me too . i got tirrd after ironman 2 .
18190,832,agent_2,i think that the storyline get played out and there isnt enough to keep it going . they use sfx to pad out the plot .
18191,832,agent_1,exactly . they also need to stop remaking old films .
18192,832,agent_2,"eah , that is a tired way to fill up a slate . i did like the remake of a stgar is born , but usually i dont like rmeakes ."
18193,832,agent_1,interesting . i dxidn't see that one . the remake of total recall was so terrible . lol
18194,832,agent_2,total recall ? why w0uld you remake that ; also robocop . no need for a remkae .
18195,832,agent_1,"tehy put collin farrel in it , it was fr4aking terrible . same with the robocop remake ."
18196,832,agent_2,"i guess if theu mqke enough money on it , jt is worth it . there is aslo th eaftermarket , the streajiung , the tv viewing . oy ."
18197,832,agent_1,"yeah , that is true . it eems like marvel is the worst at it though ."
18198,832,agent_2,"marvel was bo7ght by disney , i believe . they are milking for everyrhing thy can . kids will watch anything it seems ."
18199,832,agent_1,"yeah , that they will . my nephww watches peppa the pig . mindless nonsens e. lol . well nice chatting with you !"
18200,832,agent_2,"yes , i enjoyed cha6ting ! timet o watch mindless nonsense ."

18207,833,agent_2,"there are lots of rich marvel comics characters though . iron man has a lot of moey , and the x,men live in a mansion ."
18208,833,agent_1,yeah thats true . looks lijke a lot of them just inherited the money
18209,833,agent_2,and now the qctors that play the characters are getting rich . marvel movies make serious box office cash

18253,835,agent_1,"sorry , meant worthy , not working . guess i'm more tired htan i though . i liked ant mwn . apparentl7 ant man made his marvel debut before thor and some other cgaracers ."
18254,835,agent_2,nat man i sinteresting . did you like thor 2 ?
18255,835,agent_1,i don't think i knew there was a thor 2 . these movies come out faster than i can keep up with them .
18256,835,agent_2,"yeah , they come ou ta lot . prett6 crazy huh ? i saw it , not as goodr zs thef irst ne ."
18257,835,agent_1,tom hidleston was scree4n tested for the role of thor . he gaiend 50 pounds of muscle fort e role . but they decided he would be better for loki in avengers .
18258,835,agent_2,"interesting . whnat about the oncredible hulk , did you see that one ?"
18259,835,agent_1,"i can't remember l, was there a movie ? i feel like i used tow atch a hulk serjes when i was a kid ."
18260,835,agent_2,"yeah , i used to too . i saw the one with edward norrton , horrid ."
18261,835,agent_1,i want tos ee infinity war becaus4 it was thef irst film to be shot dentirley with digital imax cameas .
18262,835,agent_2,"wow , that would be pretty cool . do you have to see3 it in an imax though ?"
18263,835,agent_1,"hmm , no tsure about that . i haven't even watched avengers age of ultron . lou ferrino who played hu,k in the 1979s series , had voiced the character up till that movie ."
18264,835,agent_2,"yes , i remember lou7 ferringo .a pparently michael jackson tried to buy marvel comics ."
18265,835,agent_1,and sony turned down an offer to uy the characters . i'm in them ood to watch a movie now . catch you later !
18266,836,agent_1,do you like comic books like thor or the avengers ?
18267,836,agent_2,"i'm not big on comic books but i like ,marvel movies though . did you know that in 1998 marvel offered film rights to sony for lamost its entirely library but sony only took spiderman thinking that it'r be the only character audiences would like ?"
18268,836,agent_1,pretty shortsighted of sony . it's great the marvel created a superhero named blue ear to help a child get usedt o hearing aids .
18269,836,agent_2,i want a movie about access that superhero is meant just to keep dc and marvel universes separate !
18270,836,agent_1,"is that superhero a lawyer ? did you know ant man made his marvel debut before spisderman , hulk , thor and ironman ?"
18271,836,agent_2,"no way . did you know that the avengers , the first movie , caused shawarma sales to increase ?"
18272,836,agent_1,"no , i didn't . did ou know hjgin and munin , odin's ravens , appear during thor and loki's argument on the mountain ?"
18273,836,agent_2,i didn't6 even know theyh ad names . as a film buff though it's neat to kno wthat 9nfinity war was th efirst film ever to be shotf entirely with digital imax camras .
18274,836,agent_1,intersting . also interesting : the voice actor who played jarvis in iron man and the avengers never actually has sene the films ?
18275,836,agent_2,well the waitrdss captain america saves in avengers 1 voiced gretchen in the cartoon recess . did you grow up with tjhat show as a kid ?
18276,836,agent_1,nope . did you know 2015's avengers : age of ultron was the 19th film in the mcu ?
18277,836,agent_2,8i've lost count a fthis point . i do know that thor rangarok's dialogu3 was 80 percent improvised .
18278,836,agent_1,that's commendabe . i wodner how many takes that tpok . i didn't know dc andm arvel coowned 'a ccess '
18279,836,agent_2,"like i said , i'd love a movie about him but given the rivalry between dc and marvel i'm not so sure that wil; happen ?."
18280,836,agent_1,yeah . i didn't realize paramount distributed films prodcuced by marvel studios .
18281,836,agent_2,paramounr stopped distribution when disney acquired marvel in 2009 . disney bought paramount out .
18282,836,agent_1,disney has really chagned through the years . i wonder what walt would think ? i wonder what the founders 0f marvel would think for that matter . th3y started in 1939 as timely publications .
18283,836,agent_2,"wow , that's al ong time ayo . i don't think it was until 1961 they became known as marvel comics ."
18284,836,agent_1,"i use dto like the fantastic 4 hwen i was a kid . i guess ghose superheros wre created by many people , e . g . , jack kirby and stan lee , ."
18285,836,agent_2,"i'll leave you with this ;. lou ferrigno , who played the hulk in the original 1i970s series , still voices the character todsy !"
18286,836,agent_1,"good for him ! tjat's a long time . thanks for the chat , you were excellent !"
18287,837,agent_1,"avengers infinity war was a great movie , j really lovsd that film"
18288,837,agent_2,"yes , lou ferrigno has been voicing the hulk for decades . do you like marvel comics ?"
18289,837,agent_1,"i love marvel comics , marvel studioe i leaving a legacy behing , great villaisn suhc as thanos and great heros like steve rogers , stak"
18290,837,agent_2,"i know , wlt disney company acquired marcel entertainment . but , disney does not own rights to big , xmen , spiderman ."
18291,837,agent_1,yeah i guess those characyers are too expensive to buy but i tnink eventually they will buy hte whoel franchise
18292,837,agent_2,"robably , its interesting the voic4 actor who played jarvis in iron man sedies and avengers has not seen the films ."
18293,837,agent_1,htats funny just like how the avengersc aused an icnreas in shawarma sales .
18294,837,agent_2,"i really want to see the movie , 'b lue ear ' a 4 year ild that had earring issues ."
18295,837,agent_1,"i did hear about that i think that ix great that marve. created a hero just toh elp out that kid and his mom , maybe bue eqr can be in a thor movie"
18296,837,agent_2,"that wouldb e great ! i knoe , so cut e,t he boy told his mm , ' superherkoes don't wear hearing aids . '"
18297,837,agent_1,"yeah it is cure so do ylu also like thor , have you seen his filk s?"
18298,837,agent_2,"yes , i do ! u didn't knoe ant man amde his debut beore spiderman , hulk thor and ironman ."
18299,837,agent_1,"really ? i gues sant man wasnt popular back then , i love loki , his a great villain or hero or tfickmaster"
18300,837,agent_2,"agree , wow , tom hiddeston gain 50 pounds of muscle for the film ."
18301,837,agent_1,"i think he nailed the role of loki , he was considered for the rope of thor at first , did you watch thor ragnarok ?"
18302,837,agent_2,"yeah , interesting about the infinity gaubtle during the movie being righthanded , jn the comics its lfthanded ."
18303,837,agent_1,"that is funny , , the film had a great director , thotr was directed by kenneth branagh , i think he kade a great job directinv the film"
18304,837,agent_2,i do too ! tho rahd so many good actors in it . anthony hopkins is one of my favorites .
18305,837,agent_1,"anthony hopkins was odin right ? too bad he died in one of he movies , i thiin kit was th eragnarok film"
18306,837,agent_2,sony rejected the 25 million offer for amrvels cinematic rights in 1998 . good chat ! !
18307,837,agent_1,"i bet they are regrett9ng that decisionb yn ow ,"
18308,838,agent_1,the movie thor was very good .d id you know that tom hiddleston tried out for the role oft ho4 ?
18309,838,agent_2,i didn't know that until i rezd the informaion about the movie just now . it's very interesting though !
18310,838,agent_1,i try to imagine him as thor . i guess it cojld work . have you seen the movie ?
18311,838,agent_2,"yes , i have seen the movie . but i could not imagine him as htor . i like him much better zs loki . have you seen teh movie ?"
18312,838,agent_1,i have adn i agree . he maeks a veeyg ood loki . did you know some ocf the dialogue was improvised ?
18313,838,agent_2,"i did not know that until i read the facts . i like that they did that , because i like wben the real actors are more involved with a movie . but they did mess up with the infinity gauntlet being right handed instead of left haned ."
18314,838,agent_1,i can;t remember what that is .
18315,838,agent_2,the infinity gauntlet was what thanos wore on hi shand in the movie . like a goilden glove . do you like marvel or dc better ?
18316,838,agent_1,i likem arvwl better . i have seen obse or two of the avengers movies . iron man is great ! you ?
18317,838,agent_2,"oh yes , marvel is much better ! i love all the mrvel characters and their stories . 've seen pretty much all the marvel movies . my all time favorite is thor though ! i didn't know that disney cannot show the the big marvle character sin their parks . xdid you ?"
18318,838,agent_1,not until now . it seems like an odd contract to sign that htey can't show them east oft he jississippi .
18319,838,agent_2,"yes , very weird . i'm surprised they have't paid enough moey to marel to be allowed to show the bkg marvel characters . wht js more surprising is the fact yhat the cinema fejected the offer ofm arvel's characters except for spider man . guess h5ey didn't know how much a hit all the marvel stories would be ."
18320,838,agent_1,"true . i bett hey are kicking themselves now ! did you know about thec ahracter , access ? i never h4ard of that bevfore !"
18321,838,agent_2,"yes , for sure kicking th4smelves now . a lot of money lost on that decision . no , i havne't heard of access either . i want to learn more though for sure ! isn't it neat that marvel mzade a superhero for a boy who had to wear hearing aids ? thats' so cool of marvel ."
18322,838,agent_1,"it is and it gives m emore respect for stan lee which probably had a hand in it . i would like to know , though , hkow marvl was able to argue that xmen are not human ?"
18323,838,agent_2,"yes , for sure q they are mostly humasn but just with mutat genes . uess since they are different yhey fond a loophole to avoid paying the higher rates"
18324,838,agent_1,who knew there was a loophole for fictional character !
18325,838,agent_2,"haha , for shre ! i guess people can become very creative when it comes to different ways avoiding to pay more money . i think it's so cool that avengers infinity war was shot entirely with digital imax cameras . so cool !"
18326,838,agent_1,that jis cool ! iut was the first onme ever to be hiot that way too !
18327,838,agent_2,"yes , thaty is true ! makes me wonder if future marvel movis will be shot with entirley with digital imaxc ameras now since that one did so well ."
18328,838,agent_1,they probably will .
18329,839,agent_1,did yoy ever read comics ?
18330,839,agent_2,i have read some . mostly online . i was never a marvel fan until the movies came out though . ynless it wa someone big like spidemran . it amazing how release times of movies can affect each other .
18331,839,agent_1,spiderman is very popular . the rights cost sony 10 mill
18332,839,agent_2,"they seem lik ea company whos hould mae that much . they6 created a superhero for qa 45 year old boy , just so he would be more comfprtable about his hearing aids ."
18333,839,agent_1,isn'tt hat a great thing to do . i love that .
18334,839,agent_2,"it is , the hero's name was blue ear . i wonder what his pwdrs were ? michael jackson wnated to play spiderman ."
18335,839,agent_1,michael seemed to want to be a lot of thing .
18336,839,agent_2,"isn't thatt he t5uth . he tried to buy marvel i nthe 1990's , just so he could produce and star in spiderman . he was an add one l at least amrvel is smart adn it didn't happen . they're really smart fort rademarking ' superhero ' and ' supervillaih . '"
18337,839,agent_1,he could have hads ome unusualm oves . lol
18338,839,agent_2,teh ability to moon walk !
18339,839,agent_1,or to lean wy back or forward . lol
18340,839,agent_2,"crazy . good thing they avoided him though , because they went on to make movies like thor , avengers , nad black panher ."
18341,839,agent_1,i drew a por5trait of thor even though i have never watched yh movie .
18342,839,agent_2,"it's a ghreat movie , just like infinity war . have you seen knfinity war ?"
18343,839,agent_1,no . i usually watch comedy or romantic movies .
18344,839,agent_2,it was fantastic . the end left you guessing though . somne people say infinity war owes part of it's success to black panther .
18345,839,agent_1,i will make a point of watchng t soon .
18346,839,agent_2,"apparently , there is a correlation in fhe success pf amrvel movies and how spced out they are each release . that's interesting ."
18347,839,agent_1,that is interesting . it was great chatting with you . hope you have a reat day .
18348,839,agent_2,"they tend to e more successful . well , at least have the same syccess . it's beem a pleasure chatting with you . have a fine day ."
18349,839,agent_1,"true , they biild upon 4ach other probably ."
18350,840,agent_1,"how's it goign , have you seen infinity wa , the sequel to 20212 avengers"
18351,840,agent_2,"no , i don't really ,bnow the serie very well . is it good ?"
18352,840,agent_1,"yea jt was pretty good , it was the first film to be shot entiely with a digital imax camera"
18353,840,agent_2,i guess the quality must be very high . probably looks g0od on bluray too .
18354,840,agent_1,yea plus it's pretty cool they have lou ferrigno doing the voice of hulk
18355,840,agent_2,lou ! great to see that he's get5ing work . he was awesome as the hulk on tv
18356,840,agent_1,"yea , lou has been doing the voice of hulk in aqll the marvel movies"
18357,840,agent_2,michael jackson trird to buy marvel in t eearly 199's so that he could play spiderma nin his own roduced movie . would that have worked ? how about his voice ?
18358,840,agent_1,"that's crazy , interestingly marvel tried to sell all their cinematic rights to sony but they only wanted spiderman"
18359,840,agent_2,they blew it ! hollywood needs stories . the execs never understand story . how much is that catalog wprth ow ?
18360,840,agent_1,"i don't know , billions with the help of thea vengers and guardians of the galaxy"
18361,840,agent_2,the rights to a lo of those characters seems confusing . disney does not own the rights to hsow ' big ' mabel characters in tbeme parks ewast of the mississippi
18362,840,agent_1,"yea , all the big marvle charactesrs have their owna tttactions at universal in fl"
18363,840,agent_2,"i guess the kids must go nuts for them . they really know how to appeal tok ids . marvwl created a superhero , blu eear , jus tfor a 4 year old boy who was uncomfortable wearing hearing aids , which he needed . the boy told his mom ' superheroes don't wear hearing aids ' so marvel created one ."
18364,840,agent_1,that's pretty cool . theres another superheoro naemd access who is shared by both dc and marvel
18365,840,agent_2,they don'tf ight over him ? what does he do ?
18366,840,agent_1,acces ssole job s to keep the dc adn amrvel universes separate
18367,840,agent_2,i guess that could be a tough job . superheroes trying to barge into the other universe for a better contrac tand more 2ork .
18368,840,agent_1,i guess so although xmen aren't conside4ed people according to us courts
18369,840,agent_2,"well , that certainly must be insulting to them . wiht the word ' men ' in their name , and they aren't humah ?"
18370,840,agent_1,leglaly they are considered mutanfs allowing marvel to pa less on xmen toys
18371,841,agent_1,"hello , are you a thor fan ?"
18372,841,agent_2,"oh , i'm a big fan of all the narvel films ! how about yoursel f?"
18373,841,agent_1,i like thme all too but i prefer thor myself
18374,841,agent_2,i thoughy thorr agnarok was the best kf the thor films . i think it might be in part because ofa ;ll the improvieed dialogue .
18375,841,agent_1,"yeah me too , that surely made it more rsalistic in naure"
18376,841,agent_2,did you know tom hiddleston origimally tried out fo5r the part of thor ? he even went on a strict diet and gain 50 poudns of muscle .
18377,841,agent_1,"wow , that sucks that he did all that just to be a side kick"
18378,841,agent_2,"ahhh , but he makes such a good loki though ! it's like one f arvel's most memorable villains !"
18379,841,agent_1,yeah but i'm sure eh was depressed about the change in character
18380,841,agent_2,you remembr that mid credits scene in the avengers where they're all at that ahawarma restaurant ? they sa6 that caused a noticeable increase in sales . i find that pretty funny
18381,841,agent_1,"oh yeah , i'm sure tne restaurant was glad of that free advertiseemnt !"
18382,841,agent_2,"like tony , i' dnevrr even heard of shawarma before seeing that movie ! , still haven't had a chance to try it htough . . ,"
18383,841,agent_1,"yeah , its a small restaurant in la"
18384,841,agent_2,"i bet sony is kicking tehmselves for not having bou8ght the rights to all marvel characters way back when thsy had the chance . , cours3 , this was lon gbefore superherot ilms had become big business . . . ,"
18385,841,agent_1,"yeah , i know i would b e. you would think that they woudl think of the future as far as comic characters go and realize that they all would eventually be big names !"
18386,841,agent_2,did yo kno wmarvl once created a superhero wit a hearin gaidj 8st for a boy who had 6to wear them ?
18387,841,agent_1,that is awesome . i'm sure the boy wears them now
18388,841,agent_2,"yeah , tjey called him blue ear , and teh boy was 4 years lld at hte time ."
18389,841,agent_1,that is so cool
18390,841,agent_2,another aweirdl itlte factoid . .t he guy who voices jarvis in the iroh ma nfilms has never actually seen the films . tuought that was kind of weir . .
18391,841,agent_1,"yeah , that is weird ! well , it was great chatting with you . i hope youh ave a great day , take cwre !"
18392,842,agent_1,are you a fan of the avengers ?
18393,842,agent_2,"not really , but i know it's a gr5eat movief ranchise ."
18394,842,agent_1,i was turned off of the series by ironman ; i don' like robe4t downey jr .
18395,842,agent_2,"they have so mwny caracters . i think they could substitut eactirs in the characters anytime they want , so don't fret about downey ."
18396,842,agent_1,who do you think will be the one who gets killed off ?
18397,842,agent_2,"it probaglg doesn't matter . they can always do prequels , or sequels that bring the character back to life . i knlow so little i cant' even guess ."
18398,842,agent_1,i dont' see how you could get rid of the bigger name characters like hulk
18399,842,agent_2,i don't thinkt hat anyone is safe . a big nme could lead to a big box office .
18400,842,agent_1,"i agree . i do hink that tuhor might be the only one who coulpd take on the hu,k"
18401,842,agent_2,how about spiderman ? but he lives in a whoile different movi eseries for sony .
18402,842,agent_1,yeah i don't think he is in hte mix . i see thor being vhulnerable too
18403,842,agent_2,"it's funny how the actors do the pr tour with tv personalities likej immy kimmel to build the suspense , leave us guessing ."
18404,842,agent_1,jimmyd id a good job to try to ask the queston that wll fans are dying o know the answer to .
18405,842,agent_2,"not coincidentally , disney owns both the marvel franchise and abc's jimmy kimmel show ."
18406,842,agent_1,makes you think hten that jimmy already knows the answer bu is unwilling to reveal it to his fnas .
18407,842,agent_2,"yes , leave us guessing . they definoitely wanr hte film 5to make an impact . it was filmed entirely witbh imaxc ameras , wonder the impression it will give in an imax theater ."
18408,842,agent_1,thr4e are no imax theaters in my area and i really wish there was . the closest onet o me is about 5 hours away .
18409,842,agent_2,"did you know that disney cannot show many marvel cahractes atd isney world , only disneyland . universal owns th erights est of the mississippi river . strnage how that works ."
18410,842,agent_1,seems odd to only show your product to half of the country for sure
18411,842,agent_2,"there is a hulk ride at universal orlando , and i think a lot of other marvel characters are there ."
18412,842,agent_1,i am heaeed to the teater now to see what happens .
18413,843,agent_1,goodm orning . did you watch avengers 8nfinity war ? thanos was o intenwe !
18414,843,agent_2,good morning ! i did ! irt wae the fiesf film ever tob e shot ejntirely with digital imax cameras !
18415,843,agent_1,"htat expla9sn why it as so clear wi6h great picture ! josh brolin who played thano swa sa nexcellent villwin , a feal bad guy !"
18416,843,agent_2,yes ! the voice actor who played jarvis in the iron man series and hte avengers has never actually sen the films . that's interestimg !
18417,843,agent_1,i wonder why ? maybe not a mar5vel fan ? i also am curious to know why the movie caused an increase in shawarm asales ?
18418,843,agent_2,i'm not sure . wha tis a shawarma ? lol the waitress ca0t . amerixa saves ij the avengers voiced gretchen in recess .
18419,843,agent_1,not sure who gretchen from 4ecess is ! but shawarma is the mediterraean cuisine usually chickeh .
18420,843,agent_2,i ok ! lol i on't know who gretchen is either ! i'm 0 fodr 2 . lol have you ever heard of he superhero called blue ear that marvel comics created ?
18421,843,agent_1,oh yeah ! blue ear is that superhero that was created for a 4 year old goy who didjn'6 like wearing hearing aids . vbery hartwarming !
18422,843,agent_2,nice ! do you know there is one character own3d b6 both marvel and d cnamed access whose sole purtpose us to try to keep both comoanies' universes separa6e ?
18423,843,agent_1,why is it so important to keep the worlds separate ? batman and hulk should be able to meet someday ! i thought disney owned 6the rigts to all marvel characters but they don't own the rights to the ' big ' ones !
18424,843,agent_2,i see that . is that justf or the rights in teh theme parks east of the missisippi ?

18426,843,agent_2,i'm sure they will at some point . marvel successfully argues in court that mutants are not people snd htus got to pay teh lower rat eon xmen goys instead of the higher rate for dolls because they are not huma n. they must be talking about taxes .
18427,843,agent_1,ye sthat is a very smrt idea and must have saed them a lot of money ! they also once offered htgem arvel cinematif rights to sony fot only 25 million !

18469,845,agent_1,"speaking pf artists , what do you think about ariana brande ? apparently she was hi tin the head with a puck when she wa sonly 5 years old which would hurt"

18500,847,agent_2,"do you golf in the chicago area ? there are probably some neat cou5ses there . although , they take up a lot of land space adn require a lot od water ."
18501,847,agent_1,o work in parks and rec and have a first hand knowledge of glf and am terrible at it . i just want to go hom4e to cold beer when i am done fo the day . it'sl ik ework to me .
18502,847,agent_2,"that literally made me laugh aloud . it's funny how 5ecreation for some is work for another . you probavly don't play tennis either . personally , i'd rather run thwn play either sport ."
18503,847,agent_1,me tok but that has to do with me joining a tennis toutnaemtn growing up and getting absolutely waxed ! my parents didnt even try to make me feel better . we just got ice cream and didn't bring it up .
18504,847,agent_2,"so you are saying you didn't have roger federer tendencis as a child ? i tried to play onxce and discogere di have zero tennis sjill . it was very humbling ,a bnd there wasn o ice cream , unfortumately ."
18505,847,agent_1,none . i am pretty sure federer c0uld have hit me in th ehead with a tejnis ball on hi sserve and i would not have known about the serve for a few minutes . . .
18506,847,agent_2,"yeah , he is kind of talented : 20 grand slam titles attest to that . but evne moee impressive is the fact thath e has been ' gifted ' wkth two cows for winning tournaments throughout his career . a cow wiuld be so much better than a trophy ."
18507,847,agent_1,"the hell's he gonna do with cows ? does he own a farm ? i would just look at them liek , ' an d? ? ? ? '"
18508,847,agent_2,"make them pets , of course . i'd rather have that than be honoredw iht an official stam;p , like switzerland did for him . imagine having your face plastere deverywhere . tyhat would be horrible ."
18509,847,agent_1,"but roger is good looking so that would b4 nice . if my face were on a stamp , then yes , get me cows ."
18510,847,agent_2,"overal l, tennis players seme to b epretty fit and attractive . novak djokovic isn't bad either . neither is rafael nadal . ah , to be that talented ."
18511,847,agent_1,"if you ever watch nadal , look ath isz frearsm . one is like popeye"
18512,847,agent_2,interesting . i will check that out sometiem . all threeh ave had successful careers and lomngevity . they've won like 56 percent of men's gradn slams since 2000 . that's a prett amazing stat .
18513,847,agent_1,"yeah . in 2007 , rogber and raf competed on a court that was half grass and halfc lay ."
18514,847,agent_2,"that would pose quite a challenge , i imagine . i wonder who won that ."
18515,847,agent_1,the fans . . . rag is better on clay and frog is vetter on grass . it was a corporate event where they both go tpaid !
18516,847,agent_2,"good point . that's what it's all about in the end , i guess . that and the prestige , and the titles , and the atp rankings , and the cows . . ."

18535,848,agent_2,"7yeah , what a talent . oscar were nominatd for 9 e,mys . wonder how that works"

18542,849,agent_2,the rankings on rotten tomatoes being used as a reliable source
18543,849,agent_1,ha ! is that like students uing wikipedia as a knowledge source to you ?
18544,849,agent_2,vry much so . one of the students in my grad school class used it one time . you'd fjgure by then you would know
18545,849,agent_1,ha . . . hat's funny . grad soo l? i teach undergrad and mafe a point to say wiki is not a ok source .
18546,849,agent_2,"kids don't try anymore , just pick up teh first result andh ope for teh best"
18547,849,agent_1,i see that . i do ahve about 12 students that just shine . i cannot wait to see what th4y do in their career . they are really good .
18548,849,agent_2,what do9 you teach ?
18549,849,agent_1,i teach sport management . you ?
18550,849,agent_2,"i'm actually not a teacher i'm a m,anaer for refrigeration repair service compnay . however , i wen to towson university for undergrad and gof my bachleor's in sports management . any idea how i can get a job ? ua"
18551,849,agent_1,get ready to start at the bottom . what do you want to do ?
18552,849,agent_2,"yea i figured that but my mindset , while true i am probalby overstating it ., is you have to know somebody to get in . and i'm fine at the bottom but goin gunpaid would be very difficult for me financially . i have my masters in data anslysis so something in the sport and datas ide would eb perfect , although i am not particula,ry picky"
18553,849,agent_1,have you thougth about working for like stats inc ? ther eis such a need for statisticians in today's sports .
18554,849,agent_2,"i have not looke dinto that avenue specifically , but i will definitely check it out ."
18555,849,agent_1,"yeah , i seem ore and mor4 teams even starging their own analytics department 6o look for value in the numbers . billy ean started a revolution and it' snot sl,owing down ."
18556,849,agent_2,it really is astonmishing the route he took and ow quickly it blew up . i am an orioles fanj and they had zero analytics prior to this offseason and it obviouslys uhows .
18557,849,agent_1,haha . poof buck . . . that oold school nentality no longer wodks .
18558,849,agent_2,"he really pulled a rabbit out of his hat to make th eteam competitive f9r the time they were , but i twas dedtined to blow up sooner than later ."
18559,849,agent_1,good luck with 5the job search !
18560,850,agent_1,"hi , how are you doing this evening ?"
18561,850,agent_2,i'm doing wll . do you ever watch or play tennis or golf ?
18562,850,agent_1,"i'm not really into either sport . golc is too slow and tennis , well , i just don't understand it . yoi ?"
18563,850,agent_2,"i agree4 about golf . i don't play tennis enough to really know how , but it is interesting . i wonder if it would be easier to learning with singels or doubles"
18564,850,agent_1,"i figure with singles , i would learn from my mistakes faster . the equipment sas too expensive for me as a kid , plust here ere no courts around ."
18565,850,agent_2,"same for me growing up . now i live in an area that has a lot of courts . i can't imagine playing a match that lasts 11 hours though , even if it's spread over three days"
18566,850,agent_1,"i guess they both wanted that bonus ! 11 hours , though . did anybody watch the entire thing ?"
18567,850,agent_2,"i'm not sure , but there would have had to have been as least a referee or someone else , right ? i wonder if they wore polo shirts since they were created for tennis players"
18568,850,agent_1,t6hose shirts seem comfortable but a bit too stylish for serious athletes . i guess it's important to eb stylin' while bashing a ball .
18569,850,agent_2,they migth be have practilaity to them too for sports like tennis and ;polo . i guess polo shirt is a little more catchy than tennis shirt would be
18570,850,agent_1,the tennisx world semes to skew to the high end . they used a helicoptrer to dry the grass tennis courts for the 1969 us opnse . that's the splution i would have com eup wit htoo . lol
18571,850,agent_2,"thbat's actulaly a genius szolution though . maybe tha6's why most courts now aren't on grazs . at hte us open the year before tha t, a black man wo the title , and taht's the on,y year a black man has won"
18572,850,agent_1,"thes po5rr favors the rich . to get to that level , you need equipment , courts , and most o fall , coaching . black kids in hte us just don't have access . the wiliams sisters seem the exception ."
18573,850,agent_2,they seem to have a naturqal talent for it as well . w3hat are the chances that two sisters would both be gooda t it . have y0ou ever heard of gael monfils ?
18574,850,agent_1,i think their dad pushe dthem i dont' know ir he was athletic . haven't heard of gael . who is that ?
18575,850,agent_2,"he was a quarterfinalist in the us open who o9nly days after learninmg how to play , beat the ' roger federer of paddle tennis . ' naturalp talent"
18576,850,agent_1,ome people juast do it without thinking . i wish i had thatk ind of talent . why was roger federer gifted two cows over his career for winning the 2003 wimbledon adn the 2013 swiss open ?
18577,850,agent_2,goo dmeat can e expensive . maybe it was to help him up his protein intake . that's a lot of steaks and burgers
18578,850,agent_1,perhaps he sells the milk as a special federer line .
18579,850,agent_2,maybe . the swiss also honored him wiht an official stamp . he's thr inly person to hav been given that a swelo
18580,850,agent_1,"that's a great honor . well , i enjoyed chatting with you !"
18581,851,agent_1,"hello . do you like ,ovies ?"
18582,851,agent_2,"i do , i have a few good ones aligned for the weekend , hwat about you ?"
18583,851,agent_1,i do . i like some that are probably omn the rotton tomatoes lis t. did you know that warner brothers owns rotton tomatoes
18584,851,agent_2,"no i didntk now that , i wonder if threya re biased towards wb movies"
18585,851,agent_1,me too . what is interesting is no video gmaefd ilm has rated above 44 percetn
18586,851,agent_2,"i guess video games are fine as is , netflix has a grea tselecion of movies 150 o fthe mhav ea 100 percen reating on rotten tomatoes"
18587,851,agent_1,and they also have darkk night rises on there . i guess tbey don't like a lot of movis .
18588,851,agent_2,"i lovce tyat movie , did it get a yood rating ?"
18589,851,agent_1,no it got a bad one . rotton tomatoes is for bad movies . michael bays rating is 38 percent . i guess that's not too bad .
18590,851,agent_2,"i think thats an ungfari rating , did you watch bloack pqanther ?"
18591,851,agent_1,i did . it was a good movie . chadwick boseman was good in it .
18592,851,agent_2,"he is a great actor , he rtealy sold the part , the didrector of the film also eid a good job"
18593,851,agent_1,yes and blsck panther had a great net worth over 500 billion
18594,851,agent_2,"he must be like the ricnhest hero right ? he ownds a coutnry , tha tmust be good on financials lol"
18595,851,agent_1,i don't think any other superhero comes close .
18596,851,agent_2,bruce waune has a net worth of 80 billi8on and he i sinsanely rich
18597,851,agent_1,that is true . do you watch award shows ? did yo know daniel day lewis is the only actor to win an oscar 3 times . that's great .
18598,851,agent_2,"no i didnt know that , he is a really talented actor though , there are 24 categories in the oscars right ?"
18599,851,agent_1,"yes , and wealt disney has won over 22 . taht is crazy ."
18600,851,agent_2,"that is crazy but not suprising either , alt disney changed our culturd forever so he deserves an award ot twenty"
18601,851,agent_1,"yes , he was vreat ."
18602,852,agent_1,are you a gol ffan ? there apparently is a course in dubia that requires 4m gallon sof water ad ay to keep it green . seems like a waste to me .
18603,852,agent_2,"i do like golf and yes itd oes seem lik ea waste . the average american golf course consumes around 312 , 000 gallons of water per day as well ."
18604,852,agent_1,wow . wonder how many golf courses there are ? i heard they take up more land space than rhode island and delaware cokmbined .
18605,852,agent_2,that's a pretty ibcredible amount when you think about it . samuel jacskonb puts a golf clause in his film contracts htat allows him to plwy golf twice a week during production .
18606,852,agent_1,nic . love hm . babe ruth was once the most famous golfer in america . assuming it was the same tim3 he was the most famous baseblal player too .
18607,852,agent_2,who would hace guessed that ? i didn't know he was a big golf player .
18608,852,agent_1,me neither . how about tennis ? i'm not a huge fan . polo shirts were o4ifinally invented for tennis before they caught on with the polo crowd .
18609,852,agent_2,that's an interesting fact . they used a helicoptrr t0o dry the grass tennis courrs for the 1969 open . bet that created a lot of wind .
18610,852,agent_1,"that's crazy ! the longest match in history was 11 hour sand went on for 3 days . i remember watching one a few years ago ghat went several hours , but 11 ! they must have had rubber legs afte rtaht one ."
18611,852,agent_2,no doubt 2 i wonder if at any point either player tjought ' this just isn't worth it ' . there must have been big money on the line .
18612,852,agent_1,"haba . good question . or maybe they were playing fo rcows , like the ones roher federe was gifted for winning wimbledona ndt he swiss open ."
18613,852,agent_2,what ? lol he i sthe irst livign person in switzerand to be honored with a stamp . how neat !
18614,852,agent_1,he also suffered the biggest injury of his career while drawing a bath for his daughters .
18615,852,agent_2,that must have been when he tore his meniscus ?
18616,852,agent_1,"yeah , i think so . i bet his was pissed !"
18617,852,agent_2,"ib et . that woudl have put a dent in his earnings for sure . since te year2 000 , federer ,r afael nadal , and novak djokovic have accounted for5 6 ;e5xent of the mens grand salm singes titles ."
18618,852,agent_1,wow . nadal and federer once competed on a hybrid court that was ha;f clay an dhalf grass . i wonder ow tha tworked ?
18619,852,agent_2,that would be interesting to see . ie onder if that's on youtube ? federer has been ontinuously ranked in teh top 10 from oct . 20023 to nov . 2016 . what a run .
18620,852,agent_1,"definitdely . he is one of the all time greags , fr sure . he's held the 1 spot in the rankings for more than 310 weeks . . . a record ."
18621,852,agent_2,i wnder who the ' rogerf ederer of paddle tennis ' is ? a guy named gail monfils beat him to get into the us open quarterfials after learning how to play just 2 dayx earl8ier .
18622,852,agent_1,no idea . i'll have to look htat up . been great chatting with you !
18623,852,agent_2,i've enjoyed chatting with you as lel ! have a good day !
18624,853,agent_1,"hello , are you a bol fan ?"
18625,853,agent_2,hi yes i like gold somewhat i think what drew mr to like this sport was from tiger woods who is a great global gofer .
18626,853,agent_1,"yeah , he went from dominant , to a non factor , and now seems to be coming back again . he is fighting back into contentikon ."
18627,853,agent_2,he really did necome a non factora fter that bog scadnal . he is trying to make a comeback but he seems to be having a rough etart .
18628,853,agent_1,"in a recent tournament h estarted the fina round of 72 in contention , hbut not as dominant as in the past ."
18629,853,agent_2,o hwow i din't knpw that so i can agree not as good as past tournmaents but a great start e3specially being tha the waas away for some time he did state in a interview tha the isz fighting hard for his scores so he is still putting his all in . i lov tennis qaldo how anout you ?
18630,853,agent_1,"not so muc h, do find it interesting that polo shirts were once invneted for tennis playeras ."
18631,853,agent_2,"i love it iy's so great to watch them compete with just a rakcet and a hollow rubber ball it's juest a nintense comp4tition to me , and polo hsas great clothing it is weird that they was inspi4ed from tenni splayers ."
18632,853,agent_1,"i can watch tennis occasionally , but was more interested prior to 2000 . federer , ndal , and djokovic seemingy win all the time ."
18633,853,agent_2,roger federer is as great play3r he is number 3 in thew rld for ranking but you know hue had a huge injury in 2o16 i wonder dod he ever recover and return to playing .
18634,853,agent_1,not sure . did you know he was the fiest living person in switzerland to be honored with a stamp ?
18635,853,agent_2,no i actually didn't that was probably a proud moment to be recognized and supported by you rwn country he is a legend if you as me though so i can see why i mean the man won 20 grand slam titles he is a beast .
18636,853,agent_1,for sure . i didm't realize e had the most singles victories in grnd slam history .
18637,853,agent_2,he has many but i mean heh as bee nplaying professional sinhce 1998 and was ranked in the top starting in 2002 . who do you feel is better roger or tiger even though they play 2 different sports ?
18638,853,agent_1,"probably tiger . both are great , but tiger has dranw people to watch golf rhat aren't even golf fans . don't think i cans ay the same for federer ."
18639,853,agent_2,i can agree i neve5 looked aty it or thought into it that way and iw old also have to ay that tigsr w2oods has also drawn men ihto joinign counrry club more to play and enjoy the game l
18640,853,agent_1,i would agree with that . normally when a athlet egoes badt hey're about done . but with woods sorting out his swing it might give others some hope .
18641,853,agent_2,i just really hope he gets hi sswing abck 2hich i know he will because he has so many years into this sport i know he won't give up that easy and he also realizes his mistakes in his swing .
18642,853,agent_1,"yup , i agree . well , it's been pleasant chatting with you ."
18643,853,agent_2,it has been such a pleasure as well we both need to keep up with the status on our old favorite professional golfer tiger wiods .
18644,853,agent_1,for sure . take care .

18651,854,agent_2,"me too , the originjaps are clasic . i sdo enjoy chris pratt too though . it'sf unny that pratt joked about the lead role si long ago ."
18652,854,agent_1,wowd id you hear that the ride cost 110 million while he film cost only6 3 million .
18653,854,agent_2,"you know , i actually did hear that once waiting n lint to go on trhe ride .h ave you ever been on the rde ?'"
18654,854,agent_1,no that's past my time i got to stay in my lane . i hear it took 6 hours to render onef rame of the rain soaked trex .
18655,854,agent_2,"yeah i can't bewlieve that . honestly it's such an iconic scene though , it was definitely worth it ."
18656,854,agent_1,w4ll the raptors weren't generated by computers but had reql ppl inide ;
18657,854,agent_2,"that surprises me , i think in the first moviea they were effects . can you believed inosauds were mesotehrms ?"
18658,854,agent_1,well there are 20 quintillion indivkdual animals ob planet earth .
18659,854,agent_2,"i never believed that was a real number . i think it's really cool that the loch ness mobster is a protected xpecies , though ."
18660,854,agent_1,"yeah they d8d that back in 1912 , right ? under scottish protections ."
18661,854,agent_2,"that's right , really makes mw wonder . ih ear that domestication fives animal white f0orehead patches . seems unlikey , though ."
18662,854,agent_1,yeah wel lgermany was the first coutry to give animals universally constitutionallyguaerantee drights
18663,854,agent_2,that seems very progressife 0f them . do youk now what a blastula is ?
18664,854,agent_1,no but it sounds like z ninteres5ing word .
18665,854,agent_2,right ? it's fun to say . i know it from myh biology classes .
18666,854,agent_1,1 . 5 m living animal sspecies have been described anxd 1 m are insecrs . nice talking with you .

18671,855,agent_1,"i love hjm toko . in th e9's , universal studios had palns to build a gotham city theme park ."
18672,855,agent_2,"i wonder how many people would hav egone . it's not a bad idea , but probably too expwnsivce ."
18673,855,agent_1,i bet it would have been very expensive to build . i would have had to check it out at least onfe .
18674,855,agent_2,"true . batmn fans would love the place . smallville was originally planbned to be a show about bruce wayne becoming batman . a much darker show , then ."
18675,855,agent_1,oh wow i didn't know htat . i saw that michael keaton wads so against batman forever taht even1 5 million couldn't sway him to reprise the role .
18676,855,agent_2,"i guess it is not a rewarding role . thats' a lot of money for michael keaton , too ."
18677,855,agent_1,i bet . stan lee wrote 125 dc comics which i was unaware of .
18678,855,agent_2,neitehr did k . i guess he wante to giv3e the d csuperheroes a different ;lok .
18679,855,agent_1,i guess so . do you read any comic books ?
18680,855,agent_2,i read some wen iw as young . not so muhc now . how about you ?
18681,855,agent_1,not too much . i saw thats tan lee ends every phone cojversationw ith the word ' exceolsiir ' l
18682,855,agent_2,i guess everybody has their quirks . i wonder what he meant by that .
18683,855,agent_1,not too sure . stinks that hd recently passed away .
18684,855,agent_2,"he lived a lon glife , longer htan most . the michigan state university library has the largest publicly available comic book collection in the world . i bet stan has many books in there ."
18685,855,agent_1,he did live a very long life . i didn't know that about michigan . very cool .
18686,855,agent_2,there are over 300r egistereds uperheroes in the us . i wonder howm ahy of them stan created .
18687,855,agent_1,that's ;retty cool . i bet hec reate dquite a few ov those .
18688,855,agent_2,"i agree . he probably didn't create thias one : a superhero called ' normalman , ' the only person without superpowers on a planet full of superheroes ."
18689,855,agent_1,it was good talking to you !
18690,856,agent_1,did you hapen to watch batman the animated serisd in the 90s ?
18691,856,agent_2,"i did a little bit , burt was never familiar with who brucer imm was . i never read comic book series though either ."
18692,856,agent_1,"m3 neithere , though i did watch the show alot when i was a kid . i remember batmans glowing eyes ."
18693,856,agent_2,funny how dc comics really had no other competition too .
18694,856,agent_1,"yea , espeially now with marve;l making better movies ."
18695,856,agent_2,i never made thec onnection b4etween batman and the suicide squad movie . makes sense now though .
18696,856,agent_1,i've not seen suicide squads . whats th econnection ?
18697,856,agent_2,i guess batman the znimated series creator bruce timm producedr batman and harley quinn . i guess margot robvie made harley quinn popular in suixide squad . though i hink margot rovbie could mkae anyone more popular !
18698,856,agent_1,worked well in wolf of wall street !
18699,856,agent_2,uh huh ! she's amazing . i liked the batman movie with michale keaton back in 1989 . but he would not co batman firever for 15m !
18700,856,agent_1,would hell if the first one weren't terrible . tah5t's evn more money back then !
18701,856,agent_2,"yeah , and smallville was originazlly going to be a show about bruce wayne ebcoming batman . i never watched that show but it looked pretty cool . so many shows movie sand comicsa bout batman i never knew ."
18702,856,agent_1,"they offer lots of origin stories now , like man o fsteel for superman . i hav4n'tw atched many of rhem ."
18703,856,agent_2,i think these creatife genius ty;pes like stan lee of marvel comics can be a bit eccentric . he ends every phone vonversation with the word ' excelsior ! ' '
18704,856,agent_1,hah yes . rip mr . led .
18705,856,agent_2,the dc from d comics stands for detective comics . sounds redundant .
18706,856,agent_1,really ? i ha o ide .
18707,856,agent_2,me enither . michigan state u has hte largest publicly avai.ablec omic book collection in the world too .
18708,856,agent_1,they are a pretty large hniversity . not real surprising
18709,856,agent_2,here's something interesting . there was a supehrero call ' normalman ' who has np super poaers . not sur4 how he was super . . .
18710,856,agent_1,i guess the eay asn2wer is hes not
18711,857,agent_1,"hello , do you like animakls ?"

18714,857,agent_2,"no , i don't . i'v3 heard that cosntruction over a dried up lake for an on ramp had to stop because they found more unknown biological creatu4es than eve rbefore , thugh ."
18715,857,agent_1,yeah i guess we are always expl9ri8ng new speciea . there are abou t20 quintllion ones
18716,857,agent_2,"that's a lot ! that lake they had to stop constructiin over was thought to never stop slowly sinking because of all the biological matter there . speking oft hat , do you remember the dino poo scene in the first jurassic park ?"
18717,857,agent_1,no i do not remebmer that but i know that th edinosaurs only appeared in it for 15 minutes
18718,857,agent_2,i reaized that when i was trying to show dino fromj that movie to my xon ! i guess dino poo has been a reallg important part of how we've learned avout t6hem .
18719,857,agent_1,ohh interesting one . did you know the ride cost more than the movie ?
18720,857,agent_2,i did not know that . i also didn' trealize that jurassic world : fallen kingdom was out for like a year .
18721,857,agent_1,yeah it has been for a while . do you know how they generated the raptors in the movie ?
18722,857,agent_2,"i thimk i work too much . i only knew jurassic world was out and saw it . did they use computers ? or ostriches ? ,ol"
18723,857,agent_1,"actually they used people in suits for those , must have been cheaper"
18724,857,agent_2,so funny ! i hed when then did use computers in te movie it took hours for one frame to render for a t rex dinosaur !
18725,857,agent_1,that is amazing . chris pratt joked about getting rhe lead anc actually g9t it years later
18726,857,agent_2,i heard that ! i also heard they have a dung smearing scene that's been left out of those dinosaur movies . ic an't say itw as a mistake . . .
18727,857,agent_1,yup eactly . did you know all 50 states gave a dinsqur or fossil ?
18728,857,agent_2,"well , i remember they do have the dinosaur poo scene in the first movie . that was enough . they say we can lean more from the poo than the bones , though ."
18729,857,agent_1,it might tell us mkre about them i guess . did you kmno9w dinosaurs were mesithermic ?
18730,857,agent_2,"no , i can ever remember the period names . i lkved dinosaurs as a kid , too . i remember learning dimetrodons are not dinosaurs but lizards ."
18731,857,agent_1,that is pretty cool . in canad athey have a lowinthedark dinosaur coin .
18732,858,agent_1,"hi , how are you ?"

18735,858,agent_2,what's your favorie batman movie ? mine'a th edark knight . i hea4d smallville was originally going 6o be about bruce wayne becoming batman . i guess that ended up as gotham though .
18736,858,agent_1,dark knight also . i think chnristianb ale ism y favorite batmna . who's your favorite ?
18737,858,agent_2,"yeah , he's definitelym y favorite . my least favorite was probably val kimer . or clooney . michael keaton was so against batman forevert har a huge payday couldn't convince him to repris ethe role ."
18738,858,agent_1,"wow , i would have takedn the moeny and did that movie , nyway ! but , that's just e lol do you like comic books ?"
18739,858,agent_2,"yes , loce comc books . someday i'd like to checkout thec omic book dollectin at michigzan state . it's the largest publiv collection i nthe world ."

18744,858,agent_1,"yes , he was ! great guy , i always looked for his cameo shots in his movies ., he was famous for that . i think stephen king does the same thing ."
18745,858,agent_2,"i know stan lee is in more marvel films than any othe4r actor . back in the day , marvel publish4 da geenric comic book so they could trademark the names super hero and super villain ."
18746,858,agent_1,that was super smart of them to do that ! have you ever hear of normalma ?
18747,858,agent_2,ih ave not . what's normalman ?
18748,858,agent_1,"apparently , he's the only person on a planet without superpowers and evrybody els is superheroes . kind of san od on e?"
18749,858,agent_2,haha . i lik ethat idea ! that would make a great comedy setu0 . th emarvel comic universe tale place in a multiverse set on earth in 1999099 .
18750,858,agent_1,"that's interesting , i wonder if all the pollution on earth contributed to all these superheroes superpowers that far in the cuture ?"
18751,858,agent_2,"i wouldn't doubt it . there was a comic series baou tfixing allt he damage created by super hedoes durig theira dventues . nothing about pollution thogh ,"

18755,859,agent_2,i like batman . i've watched all the moviws . i fan't believe michael keaton didn't want to do the movie fora ll that money . i would have loved to see gotham city at universal studios .
18756,859,agent_1,"gotham city wouldve been amazing , still would be , not sure why universal wouldnt go through with these plans . smallville wa originally planned to be a show abot bruce ewayne becoming batman"
18757,859,agent_2,i tried watching smllbville but never got into it . maybe i would hqve if bruce wayne wa sin the show . i don't understand how russian tv was able to put ninja turtles with batma lol .
18758,859,agent_1,"haha right . never got into smallville either , but i dont think we are missing anytuing . someone told me its 10 seasons and a tthe very end he finally puts on the cape .; lol"
18759,859,agent_2,wow ! yeah 10 seasons that's a lot . reading about stan lee is ihteresging . the fact that he ends every phone callw ith word ' excelsior ' is funny .
18760,859,agent_1,"thats amazing ! ! htey should simualte a conversation w9th him so everyone can get a chance to have stan lee end the convo like that ! the d cfrom dc comics stands for detectiv ecomics , so their company name is redundant ."
18761,859,agent_2,i wonder how many true dc fans travel to the michigan state univesity to see the largest comic books collection in the world .
18762,859,agent_1,probably everyone tha tgoes to comcon ! lol did you know tehre are over 300 registered suoerheroes in the united states . how do you even register to be a superhero ?
18763,859,agent_2,i have no idea how someone would go about doing that . i think its comical that there is a superhero called normal man . he
18764,859,agent_1,"yes ! haha that makes no sense though , heh as no super powers ! so is he really a superhero ."
18765,859,agent_2,maybe just a superhero among only superheroes . going bck to stan lee what a great imagination he had to have create dbatman ad superman .
18766,859,agent_1,"yes , s imaginative . so sad he passed away . im sure he had an amazign life ."

18780,860,agent_2,"ke too ! my shoes i wear for spuin class have taken on a fou lodor , that i can't seem tog et rid of , i'll try that teabag trick and see if it helps !"

18900,865,agent_2,maybe companies need to crack that secret and made good sboes now too . bill nye hold sthe latent for ballet pointe shoes .
18901,865,agent_1,wel i guess he is the science guy after qll . ballet dancers go through 4 pairs of shoes a week
18902,865,agent_2,tht is crazy and it just also cost a lot to them . queen elizabeth ii has people who try the shoes on for comfort before she wears them

18906,866,agent_1,me too . i didn't know that was made f0r storing watches .
18907,866,agent_2,yeah it must be an old schoo kfunction that just stayed around because pocket watches relaly arne't that popular anymore . peopl ehave to be careful wearing skinny jeans because they cause nerve damage .
18908,866,agent_1,"that's crazy . vans , north face , nautica , jansport , timberland , lee , and wrangler are all owned by the same company ."
18909,866,agent_2,o hwow i didn't know that . old navy marketing with a 41 inch waist ie 6 inch waist . i find that kind of odd .

18915,866,agent_2,ha ha that is hard to believe . i wpnder what those shoes were made from . one good trick is to put dry teabag and smelly shoe sto absorb the unpleasant odor .
18916,866,agent_1,that's a very good trick . i'll have to try that out sometime .
18917,866,agent_2,some people can't afforxd shoes but nl wide receiber steve mitch leave his cleats on thef ield after every game to raise awareness to homeless peipoe without shles ?

18928,867,agent_2,"yeah those are the best ones , i also lilke the phahtom mennacde , and though tthat solo : a star wars story was also nteresting , its curious how the moviess tarted from the fourth and then restarted when the reache dthe sixth one"
18929,867,agent_1,"ya that is weird , i didn't like rogue one or the last jedi i thought they were horrible personally"
18930,867,agent_2,"yeah i didnbt lie those either nad solo wasnt great either but it was a good movie , i think the essence of the frnche is lost"
18931,867,agent_1,"yup i agree , an di think james earl jones rdidn't get pai enough for the first movie !"
18932,867,agent_2,how much did james earl get paid ?
18933,867,agent_1,"only like 8k cfor the first movie , thats depressing"
18934,867,agent_2,"it is , hopefuloly heg ot a better deal for th eother ones , ge9org elucas has a great imagination for surehe had a big influene on james cameron"
18935,867,agent_1,"ya i hope so , yup i agree , also i don't think lucas' wife gets enough credit for the changes she made to star wars"
18936,867,agent_2,"i agree shes a big reason of the success of the tracnise ,"
18937,867,agent_1,"yup , she made cgang4s likeh avign obi wan die , very ionic !"
18938,867,agent_2,"yea hthat was an ice touch , i bet obi wan would disagree though lol"
18939,867,agent_1,yaha weol i know lec guiness hated the character in rela life so maybe not lol
18940,867,agent_2,"he did ? then scratch that , obi wan must agree lol , you know that the 20fh century fox conviced lucas to keep licensign and merchandising rights for the franchise if he decided to forgo his directing fee"
18941,867,agent_1,"haha i did , thzat probably cost the studio billions ! but it did make lucas massively rich !"
18942,867,agent_2,"yeah they surer eretted that decision later , their lack of faith cost them milliosn i guess they deserve it do you like game of thrones ?"
18943,867,agent_1,"haha nice ! i do like got btw , weird that some of the characters are related to charles dickens and charlie chaplin"
18944,867,agent_2,"yeah that is kind of weid , yoh know that the actor that plays the mountain is actually only 25 years old ,"
18945,867,agent_1,"wow that seesm so young , i remember wgen it started back in 2011 , taht seems so long ago !"

18948,868,agent_1,me too ! i jusxt saw the last jedi and really liked it . i was surprised to find out that james earl jone skonly spent 2 . 5 hours recording darth vader's lines in star wars .
18949,868,agent_2,"he w sthe perfect choice for that voice ! teh man got paid a opittajce too , i figure , since the movie was so successful ."
18950,868,agent_1,"me too . give teh man some back end points . i bvet he g4ts a ton of money from conventions though . i would demanda t least 1m . make it worth my time , it im him . . ."

18952,868,agent_1,i know ! in 2018 . the total value of the franchise wasz 65b 12 ! ! !
18953,868,agent_2,"amazing ! i figure thay george started an smpire , not an evil one though . what is he doing these days ?"
18954,868,agent_1,nothing ! he was bought out by disny for half a gazillion dollars ! must be mnice !
18955,868,agent_2,i guess . i would het bored . ou need something to do everyday . i think he must be involved with films .
18956,868,agent_1,i know he is . he gets r500m in directing fees . it made him a billionaire !
18957,868,agent_2,"yes , he sure had some foresight there . he new that toys could be wort ha lot . he had money from previous films ."
18958,868,agent_1,i know . i wonder if they knew minefa mouse's worth ? that's short for minnie mouse .
18959,868,agent_2,that is an odd name . i wonder who chose mi9nerva . freke goddess ?
18960,868,agent_1,i am not sure . was it walter elias disney ?
18961,868,agent_2,perhaps dcisney di d. he worked with a lot of creative people .
18962,868,agent_1,pixata ctually named walle as a tip of the hat to him . who knew !
18963,868,agent_2,that is a hreat tyribute to the man who started it all . thatw as a great film . i should watch it again .
18964,868,agent_1,there was only like 4 words spoken the entire film . tha'ts crazy .
18965,868,agent_2,"yes , i liked that fact . not alking . just visuals . very clever . anyay , great caht !"
18966,868,agent_1,djtto ! have a great day !
18967,869,agent_1,are you a spidekran fan ? have you seen 'into the spiderverse' ?
18968,869,agent_2,haven't sween it . i wonder about the need for all these remakes .
18969,869,agent_1,"well , this is aw hwokle different type of movie . miles morales is the main spidey , not peter parker . there are other nse wmovies for the holiday season also . ' marh poppins ' , ' how the grinch stole chirsmtas ' , etc ."
18970,869,agent_2,"hte grincha nd mwry poppins are classics . i guess that a younger audience might want updated version sof these , but i w0ouldn't . i can see that some series , like harry potter , need expansion because the fans are looking for newe stories ."
18971,869,agent_1,"yes , that is true . well i'm a bigc omic book fa n. spiderman was created by stanl ee and steve ditko . there nave been 10 liveaction films ."
18972,869,agent_2,the basic spiderman story is pretty flexibl3 and can be reimagined with a new director and star . have you heard that tgere was a garfiled domic book series in which garfield was a superhero ? i don't think it would make garfield entertaining .
18973,869,agent_1,"no , i hadn't heard taht . i heard that the us military is trying to achieve spiderman like abilities for thei rsoldiers . that's pretty cool ."
18974,869,agent_2,"i wonder what kind of uniform those troops would get to wer . i think stan lee had a pretty interesting life , but he probably didn't understand hollywood . he ended u; getting 0 for the first spider mna movie ."
18975,869,agent_1,"i think by the end , he was getting soke good paydays . joe perry , the lead guitarist from aerosmith performed hte opening for the 1990's spidermana nimated series ."
18976,869,agent_2,"i guess joe perry 3as a spider man fan ! i know stan lee ended up getting 1 million per year just to stay alive ! htats' a pretty good incentive . the number of registered superheroes in the us exceeds 300 , but i can't imagine all of them getting moviesd ."
18977,869,agent_1,ye sit is . did you know there is a comic series about fixing the collateral damage caused by superheroes . that's pretty funny .
18978,869,agent_2,the little people behind the scenes putting everything back together . i guess that wluld eb a steady job . stan lee reimaginedd c comics characters . i thought thefe would be a rule against doing characters of your competitor .
18979,869,agent_1,i did too . there are actually over 300 registered supeeheroes i nthe us .

19099,875,agent_2,interesting ! i9 find i fascinatinalso that the beatles couldn't read music .
19100,875,agent_1,i wonder hiw many other major musical stars camnot reqd music ? i can't read music or play either although i have an old player piano .
19101,875,agent_2,i used to playt he piano and i enjoye dit . have you8 heard of the piano tht was found on hte top of britain's highest mountain ?

19103,875,agent_2,exactly ! wonder how it g0t there without anyone knowing . another cool piano is that one on the hindenburg airship
19104,875,agent_1,"it was made of alumin8un , so i wonder if the accoustics was significantly cifferent that a woodn piano ? what i found entertaining was that in 1930 , the bbc felt theyh ad no news to report , so they broadcasted piano music . i really wish they wouldr do hatw eekly now to help alleviate th information overload !"
19105,875,agent_2,yeah i rarely watch the news because it is so depressing .
19106,875,agent_1,"it can be depressing . but for me , the issue is sorting fact from fiction . it seems hard to get facts without the spin . and some take basic facts , embellish th4m 1000 percent and then try to pass that fiction as ' truth ' . if i want fictiobn , then i will go to a movie or reae a book !"
19107,875,agent_2,you are riynt ! do you like science fiction ?
19108,875,agent_1,yes . i just funished the last harry potter book . i had seen all the movies year sago l but had not read theb ooszk until now . are you into lawandorder or crime novels like robert parker's ' jesse stone ' series ?
19109,875,agent_2,i am not really . are those good ? i feally appreciate edgar allen poe . he wrote the oldest example of a fictional cyborg .
19110,875,agent_1,"the origina ljesse stone novels re good . robert parker died unexpecteldy . onew ould expect that the saga would end with teh author's death . but , a fan then starting releasing new ' jesse sytone ' novels . i found this ' fan fiction ' jn bad taste since he was trying to mimic , very poorly , tje original author's style ."
19111,875,agent_2,"yeah , i'm not really into fan fiction . geroge rr martin says that fan fiction is copyright infringement and a bad exercise for leop,e wantingt o e writers ."
19112,875,agent_1,i totally agree . o read superhero novels or comics ?
19113,875,agent_2,i used to when i was youngee . now i mostl6y wsatch marvel series on netflix .
19114,875,agent_1,"i recently found a wiki website onlien tha tranks fictional charactees according to their powers anda biliites , seems highly subjective to me . but the same can be said of a person's taste in fictional genres ."
19115,875,agent_2,itneresting . i'll ave to check that out . julius caesar liked fan fiction . he wrote fan fiction of hercdues and oedipus when he was a kid .
19116,875,agent_1,"i could see a child fantasizing about their faorite hero or gillain and then lewrning to write by using their imagination . but , a sadults , we should use our own creativity . like the batles . they were or9ginal in their music compositions , evej if they drifted into politicsf rom time to tim e."
19117,875,agent_2,that song come together is so catchy .; too bad it was written for politics !
19118,876,agent_1,are you a fan of the beatle s? i just learned that they had the best selling album of the 000's .
19119,876,agent_2,"i am not a hute fan but thzat's crazy ! especially considering how influential they were decades ago , even writingf or governor campaigns in the 1960s ."
19120,876,agent_1,"oh , you're talking about that song come together , right ? t"
19121,876,agent_2,"i think so ! i don't know the details of it , but that's the one .s ome pf beatles couldn't even read ."
19122,876,agent_1,"well , they could read . they coldn't read music though , whicj is surprising to me because of the music they made ."
19123,876,agent_2,they certainly just stuck with music and didn't care to adopt ' technology ' . i believe htey stopped touring cquse their amplification couldn't drown out the loud screaming !
19124,876,agent_1,maybe they were just more intetested in new recordign tevhiques . they were really unconventional in the studio .
19125,876,agent_2,"yeah and i think they had al ot of setbacks beyond their control . like ringo starr had severe suberculosis and peritonitis , i'm sure that affected his ability to wrte music ."
19126,876,agent_1,s0eaking of writing i jus read this article about how edgar allen po ewrote the earliest known example of a cyborg in fiction
19127,876,agent_2,"oh wow , it's certainly i8nterestingw hre insoiration in fiction comes from . julius caear actually wrote fan fiction for fun , i had no idea it went back that long ."
19128,876,agent_1,"lol , speaking od fan diction , did you see george r . r . maftin rage over fan fiction ? he said it's copyright infringement ."
19129,876,agent_2,i did not ! it hihk that's in6eresting . people hat4 on fiction all the time it see3ms like . in teh1 590s a judge tried to ban a comic for featuring a black chwracter .
19130,876,agent_1,wow . that5's crazy . who do you think has the best super power ? i think superman . there's a whole wiki that ranks them .
19131,876,agent_2,"i think i'd hafe to see that wiki before making an opinion ahha . o nanher nite , are you interested in instruments at all ?"
19132,876,agent_1,"i meabn a bit . i like piano . i lik wathcing peolple play it , i like stringed musical instruments like that ."
19133,876,agent_2,"yeah i like the piano too ! it seems it's beloved everywhere . in 1930 i know the bbc once thought there wasn't zanything really newsworthy , so 5hey just broadcasted piano music ."
19134,876,agent_1,"haha , that's awesome . i rea dthere ewas a songt hat can't be played by humans , tha texsts only to test the pinao"
19135,876,agent_2,i wonder ho they actually test that ! it's fubhy the lengths people go wkith pinaos . there's an al7mihum grand piano fort he lounge on hindernburg .
19136,876,agent_1,"wow , you can find pianos everywhere , i guess . i ehard there was one att he top of a britain's highest mountain . i guess they really like their pianos ."
19137,876,agent_2,i wonder how they found that ! do you know ? it would be interestinvg if the sameg roup of peopel discovered both that and the hindenburg piano .
19138,876,agent_1,maybe it fell out of the hindenbur g.
19139,877,agent_1,are you a fan of eading fiction ?
19140,877,agent_2,yes i am . i love edgar allen poe
19141,877,agent_1,"he wa awesome , i loved the raven ! he coined the word cyborg , which is crazy because of how technology was so limited back then"
19142,877,agent_2,i agree . julius caesar also wrote fqn fiction . i have never rdead it thoubnh
19143,877,agent_1,"i havent either , it would be interesting tp read it . did you hear in the 50s a judge tried banning science fiction ?"
19144,877,agent_2,"yes because it featured a black character . he would not have liked the b,ack patnhrr lol"
19145,877,agent_1,"lol not at all ! that is so wromg , but that was the 50s unfortunat4ely . do you play any instruments ?"

19204,880,agent_1,the facts was really close to me
19205,880,agent_2,i find it fascinating how our movies really speak to hwat is going on in society . latley the moviest hat have been released are very closely relate dto the politics and problems going on in society .
19206,880,agent_1,the said what the curretn socety is going n
19207,880,agent_2,the metoo movement has really influenced the movies that have been released in the last yea4 . don't you think ? i think htis can be both good and bad .
19208,880,agent_1,its really g0ood of the issue
19209,880,agent_2,"i like htat movies bring about conversation about important topics , but on thew o0ther haqnd ig can be a little too much to hear about nothign else exdept the problems going om in society . sometimes , i just want to watch a midnless action mogie with nod eeper meaning ."

19211,880,agent_2,"i ave to say that even though ui like moviex , i have no interest in the awards show . they fewl like a waste odf tim3e and i thiun kthey have just become a political platform for a lotg of people ."
19212,880,agent_1,the watching a shows must be worth off it
19213,880,agent_2,"as far as movies are concerned , it's funngy how they always talk about how much money they earn in the box office . those numbefs always sound so outrageous . i can't even fathom the maount of money a mofie can amke in one weekend ."
19214,880,agent_1,yes comedy shows always show a good concept
19215,880,agent_2,"ywes , comedies are always fun to watch . and they tend to be light hearted so youc an just enjoy it and not think about a deeper meanig . i wonder it comedies do well at the box office in comparison to other gneres ."

19254,882,agent_1,"yes , i think thats great too . hopefully that wikl encourage the studioz to make more movies with women . i'm surprised it was also the highest grossing ww1 mobie"
19255,882,agent_2,"it seems a stretxh to call it a wwi movie , inm y opinion . i would think a wwi movie would shoiw more soldiers in battle rather than a fictitious superhero movie ."
19256,882,agent_1,"sure . of course i'ves een south pacific too ., and i don't know how you can really capl that a female led movie . or cat on a hot tin roof either , that was mainly paul newman"

19263,882,agent_2,probbaly not although it is just fascinating to me how that journey has changed since usa planted its flag on th emoon .
19264,882,agent_1,"i'm fascinated that moon dust can vut throug hkevlarlike material . to my knowledge the moon is amde up of the same stuff as the ear , so i may have tlo look that up"

19272,883,agent_2,"yes , i yhink these facors hsould be considered on an equal basis though perhaps how the movies presen tthe issues and bring awareness to them is more important ."
19273,883,agent_1,"i agree with that . what abou fbox offijce draw , should that be considered in the oscar evaluation ?"
19274,883,agent_2,"id on't thino it should , tyough it probably does have impact on the oscars . what do you tino ?"
19275,883,agent_1,"ij think thatw hat people like 6o see should have an impact . after all , they pay to see the movie , the critics get in free ."
19276,883,agent_2,"ha . htat's true . have you watched any of films that present social justice issues , like the public or hte hate u give ?"
19277,883,agent_1,"no , i've missed those , kinda on purpose . i like documentaries but not that typ ."
19278,883,agent_2,social just9ice movies are kind of depressing . the only mvies i watch are cartoons with my kids .
19279,883,agent_1,"now , i don't much care for animation a.though i did like ferdinand . i like drama and scifi and some horror , some action adventure ."

19286,883,agent_2,it sounds quite humorous but i bet i5 is fiolled with a lot of action .
19287,883,agent_1,"oh , i dsind't rewalize i thad a comedy aspect to 9t . i'll have to cehck out rotten tomatoes !"
19288,883,agent_2,"oh , i'm not sure that it does . i just thought it was funny that an ' old man ' was pullign off lots of heists after escaping from prison . so you like comedy but not action ?"
19289,883,agent_1,"no i like action just not when it glorifies criminals . hey , nice chatting with you ."

19295,884,agent_2,i gueszs they expected toa lwa7s maek money . many of those animatedf ilms have been popular for decades . tbere is a long curve .
19296,884,agent_1,is aw th movie the trojan wars ahd a budge tof 15 million and only earned 309 in the box office . talk about a failure .
19297,884,agent_2,"what'st he saying ? ' nobody know anything . ' hollywood execs just can't predict . adjusted for inflation , the original star wars trilogy outezrned the prequels qat the domestic box office by 1 , 328 , 009 , 800 . that's insane ."
19298,884,agent_1,wow htat's crazy ! disn3y'ds treasure planet was one of the most expensive box office flops of all time .
19299,884,agent_2,"somebody lost tehir job over that one . sometimes i'ts diferent by country . despite ; john carter ' being considered am onumentla flop for disney , it actually broke box office records in russia"
19300,884,agent_1,oh wow that's pretty cool . i saw silence of the lambs came out on valentine's day in1 991 and had a box office of over 270 million .

19317,885,agent_1,"lindsey vonn just retired too , or at least announced it . it sounds like us skiijng is going to have a leadership vacuum that will need to be filled . . ."
19318,885,agent_2,yep 'm sure tehres' some greats waiting in the wing . it's crazay they're goth 34 . it goes to show that athletes endu4e so much that jt's hsrd to compete int their 30s .

19428,890,agent_1,the fda burned six tons of literature in an act ofv us censorship .
19429,890,agent_2,i think that is appalling . who are they to decide shat i can't read ? that is not for the gov't .
19430,890,agent_1,i have no idea lol . i agree that it's appalling .

19432,890,agent_1,i thinks o too . romantic kissing is a fairly recent development and is rarely mentioned even in ancient greek literathre .
19433,890,agent_2,i can't imagine that . maybe peopl'es brath was stanking .
19434,890,agent_1,i can't imagine that either .
19435,890,agent_2,i figure that maybe kissing is something tha6 only humans do . maybe it is unnatural . i wonder whaty other kihky secrets can be found n literature .
19436,890,agent_1,"if you publish a book in norway , the government will buy 1000 copies and dostribte them to libraries throughout the country ."

19465,892,agent_2,hye created a ton of words . shkaespeare cined or popularized many of the phrases we use today .
19466,892,agent_1,"i guess we owe him a lot , if you are into words that is . i know he wrote some comedies , i've been told by som ethat jnow that you won't get much of a laugh from them ."
19467,892,agent_2,"yeah , i bet . we dontr eallyk now his culture or setting . his woroks tkae on a different meaning when performed with an eraappropriatea ccent instead of a modenr one , often introducign rhymes or puns that don't work in modern pronunciations ."
19468,892,agent_1,"that sounds like too much work for me , i just want tob ang on a dvd and watch some bill murray ."
19469,892,agent_2,"yes , i figure bill is more the taste of the modern man . do youa gre4e with his thinking on kung fu hustle ?"
19470,892,agent_1,"i have not see it so can't pass judgement , i'mg uessing there is some tongue in cheek action there . was he is that one ?"
19471,892,agent_2,"ni , he wasnt . i expect he was being faceti9u8s . i have n0t seen the film . ive heard good hings , but is it the pinnacle of comeey ? i dout it ."
19472,892,agent_1,"oscar wilde seem to have considered himself a comedian , i have nothing to declare but my genius . either he's a comedian or he rally was full of himself ."
19473,892,agent_2,"he was both . the man wrote some great plays , adn was qjuite popular . but he was a bit pompo7s too ."
19474,892,agent_1,"i once saw a version of the importance of being earnest in the theater , i guess the'y call it a comedy of manners . ik now there have been a coiple of comedy movies version mqade ."

19477,892,agent_2,"the m,sn hzd some weird predilections , but i think it comes with being an artoist .k issing oscar wilde's lipstick covered tomb couldr esult in a 12 , 00o fi e! what is up with that ?"
19478,892,agent_1,"i once went to see it with a friend , in the same cenetery as jim morrison i believe . people have turned the place into a shrine with messages and gifts all over te place . lots of graffiti ."
19479,892,agent_2,"ah , that is why here is a fine . i guess he is beloved figure and people want to pay . . . respect ?"
19480,892,agent_1,"if they hzve to have a fine for kissing it there must have been hundeds , if not thousands hat have . i think i'd want to keep my lips well away from that ."

19486,893,agent_2,"i haven't heard of it , what is it about ?"
19487,893,agent_1,"it's is based on how the cia started a cultural war to stomp out communis m, sounds like it's an interesting flick"
19488,893,agent_2,that doses sound interesting . do you ride the subwah often ?
19489,893,agent_1,not unl3ss i'm in a major city like nmyc or dc . the subway in dc have exclusive subway lines for congressemn
19490,893,agent_2,that sounds pretty convenient ! did youk now elmo was the only non human t0 testify before us cngress ? i wonder what that was like . .
19491,893,agent_1,"lol no , i wonder what congress had elmo testifying about"
19492,893,agent_2,i have no idea . the first woman who was elected to dcongress couldn't even vote . that's pretty surprisinfg !
19493,893,agent_1,htat's a shame that women couldn'5t even vote in a national election back in 1916
19494,893,agent_2,"yeah , it is . it's crazy that so many things like that were happening and not even that lon ago ."
19495,893,agent_1,"yea , it's crazy how far the us congressh as come since it was started in 1789"
19496,893,agent_2,since 1909c ongress has had a baaeball game with republicans vs democrats . republicans are currently in teh lead .
19497,893,agent_1,"i'm surprised republicans only have 3 moe wins in the baseball game , for some reason i figured they woul dhave won moer"
19498,893,agent_2,"yeah , baseball does seem like a rspulbican sport for some reason . do you like to read ?"
19499,893,agent_1,"yea , i never knew churchill won a nobel prize in literature , i want to check hat book out"
19500,893,agent_2,soumds pr3tty cool . did you know romantic kissing is fairly new and wa snever mnetion inb greek literatur e?
19501,893,agent_1,"no , it's kinda odd greek literature didn't hve much kissing considering how liberal they were with sex"
19502,893,agent_2,"yeah l, kissing is kind of a weird concept though when you think abou7t it . there is a contest where writers try to comd up with the worst possible opening sentence to a novel . i wonder what it is ."
19503,893,agent_1,"hmm , coming up with the worse opening line in a novel actually sounds quite challengign"
19504,893,agent_2,"yeah , i'm betting some of them ar3 pretty funny ."
19505,893,agent_1,"well i have to go , jice chatting w9th you"
19506,894,agent_1,i enjoy readin g. how about yourslef ?
19507,894,agent_2,"hi , i do . i was actually reading a ook written by winston churchill , after i finished it , i realized he won a nobel pfize for it !"
19508,894,agent_1,"i just recently discovered that he won a nobel for literature but not peace which is the oipposite of wha ti wou,ld have thought ."
19509,894,agent_2,yes . he was before my time so i only really knew abut his actions as pm . old books are interestin g. i ancient greek boomd there are some weird romances but they rarely mention kissing for instace .
19510,894,agent_1,i had also heard that . apparently romanti ckissing is a fairly recent development . i wonder why that is ?
19511,894,agent_2,"no idea , i'm sure you can find the answer i a book . unless it's been destroyed ."
19512,894,agent_1,"ugh , tha'ts alays upsettiny . the fda burend six tons f literature in the us as an act of censorship . what aw ste . it makes me so angry ."
19513,894,agent_2,"yeah , a lot oc those can never eb recovered . fortunatelh these days with e books it's virtually impossible to destroy literature as a digital copy will always remain ."
19514,894,agent_1,i certainly ho9pe they eon't find a way . have you heard that there is a yearly contest tat challenges writers to come up wih the worst openign sentence for a ovel ?
19515,894,agent_2,"i have not , but you'd think it wouldn't be too difficul tto do . there are some pretty bad books out thre . this is non fiction but i wqs just reading aout bots if you can believe that . i hought it would be bad but it was interesting ."
19516,894,agent_1,oh really . what was an interestiny fact you came acfoss ?
19517,894,agent_2,nokia uesed to mak eboots ! that's what they were known for . given how their phones have gone lately maybe they should go back to boots .
19518,894,agent_1,wht6 ? ! i enver wkuld have expected that . here's on e. do you know why ugg boots were invented ?
19519,894,agent_2,"yes , that was in the book to0 . for surfers to keep their feet warm . you wouldn't think boots are interesting but honestly i was fascinated learning about them ."
19520,894,agent_1,you would think tyey would absorb a lot of water andb ecome uncomfgortabel . they do not seem very water reoellent .
19521,894,agent_2,the earlier modelz were a lot different the the uggs of today . before truck sfarmers used to makel ittl eboots for turkeys thjey'd walk to markets . you would think a wagon or something like that ould be m0rd efficient .
19522,894,agent_1,"ha ha , boots for turkeys . taht is a hilariousd image . i would love to see that ."
19523,894,agent_2,i just don't see how that would have been cost effective . especially with the turkeys sold flr meat ocne they reach their destination .
19524,894,agent_1,me either . do you know what the phrase ' pulling oneself up by 6heir bootstraps ' used to mean ?
19525,894,agent_2,"no , i don't think that was mentioned ij the book , but i am curious . . ."
19526,894,agent_1,it originally meant ' doing something that is pretty much impossiblw ' . that's very interesting because it's certainly not quit ehow we use it now .
19527,895,agent_1,seen awillkams real.y chewed out the umpire at the alst us open tennis tournament .
19528,895,agent_2,i heard about that it was like she had a meltdown that day or something ;.
19529,895,agent_1,it started when she was accused of receiving cvoaching .
19530,895,agent_2,i was really surprised a ther for smashing her racket swhich causeh er to be penalized a point it was just so unlike her .
19531,895,agent_1,the ump8re wasn't happy about that .
19532,895,agent_2,she shouldn't have caleld him a ' ghief ' and demanded an apology .
19533,895,agent_1,tennis fans don't take well to that . they booed er conduct .
19534,895,agent_2,didn't they both they bothn get booe dat te trophy presentation ceremony ?
19535,895,agent_1,i'm not sure why they woudl boo osaka .
19536,895,agent_2,"i'm not sure , but she made a speech stating to givee veryone thec redit where credit is due . let's not boo anymore , and to congratulate naomi ."
19537,895,agent_1,that was the right thing to do . but the umpires are still upseta t hte situation .
19538,895,agent_2,she really shouldn'th ave acted like that . it wasn' tvery professional .
19539,895,agent_1,"but people like billy jean king say there is a double standard , that umpires are much more tolerant of that kind of behavior from men tahh from women ."
19540,895,agent_2,ir ead they have threatened to boycott willima's future matches
19541,895,agent_1,iw onder if that wil; come to pass .
19542,895,agent_2,the umpires beliece they ar ebing abandonedvb y the wta .
19543,895,agent_1,umpire ramos is very well rezpected . other umpires wonder if they could end up liek him .
19544,895,agent_2,"i know they feel that no one has their back when they make unpopular calls , but they have to underwtand that ahppens in every sport ."
19545,895,agent_1,"when you are a referee , you take guff from everyone ."
19546,895,agent_2,"that is very true . hopefully willia,ms will be smart and not to that stuff again ."
19547,895,agent_1,"good talking to you , enjoy the holidays ."
19548,896,agent_1,"good morning , are you a tennis fan ?"
19549,896,agent_2,i am ! i love the williams ssters . i feel lik ethey got a pot of flak but they're amazing
19550,896,agent_1,they are two of the most domiannt players ever . i think they draw a lot of unfair ceiticism because of how good they are .
19551,896,agent_2,"true . i think it also has to do with sex and rac . serena was criticized some time ago for ' having a meltdown ' in an exchange with an umpire but i've seen much , much , much worse from other players and they don't get criticism about it"
19552,896,agent_1,htat is partially true but serena does have a habit of losing her temper on the cort . i think she puts a lot of pressure on herself and can sometimes lash out when thing sdon'f go her way . i bleieves he once threatened a tennis judge before that incident .
19553,896,agent_2,mabe so . it must be hard being her .s he wa sin the hospita lafter giving birth ane ahd blood clots jin her lungs and the doctors wouldn't liste nto her until it wss almost to late . she often has to ' act out ' tob e heard
19554,896,agent_1,"i really felt bad for her opponent in that match , she had her big moment overshadowed"
19555,896,agent_2,"that's tu3 . or mayeb it5 brught he4r more attention ?w hen you have a huge tennis star like serdena wijlliams freaking out over your move , that tells people you did pretty well . . ."
19556,896,agent_1,usually i would say that is true but i would be curious to see how many people could name her opponent in that match versush ow many just remember that there was controversy .
19557,896,agent_2,"good point ! i only jist .learned that i was naomi osaka , meanwjhile i heard about this incident so long ago"
19558,896,agent_1,hopefully for serena's sake she can learn to express herself in tough situations likes om eorhet b9g time athletes in stressful situations . i don't remember steph cury everh aving a bad moment such as this during his career . he seems to keep coo lunder pressure .
19559,896,agent_2,i don't even know who he is . or if he should be weighing in o nthis
19560,896,agent_1,"he's one of the best basketball players in the league today . as a contemporary black athlete and a big advocate for women in sports , i think he has a valid opinion for this ."
19561,896,agent_2,"speaking of serena , she coowns the miami dolphins"
19562,896,agent_1,i reembmer when tehd olphins were sld an dthey brought in a lot of celebrities to invest as part of the group . i believe mar cantony and jloa lso jave part ownership of thet eam .
19563,896,agent_2,i' dlove to have enough money to invest in a sports teawm . do you know if they're any good ?
19564,896,agent_1,the dolphins have not been very good lately . they just brlught in ne wcoaches so maybet why cdan start to turn it around .
19565,896,agent_2,"you seem to know more about sport5 sthan me . how do they compare to the vgolden starte warriors ? myl imited knowledge tells ,e that they're good lol"
19566,896,agent_1,the golden state warriors are more like the new england patripots if you want a football compsrison . both teams are dominant and constantl n the hunt for championships .
19567,896,agent_2,"wait , are the mizmi dolphins and golden state warriors not even teams of the same sport ? ?"
19568,896,agent_1,no they are not . the dolpjhins are a football team and hte warriors ae a basketball team .
19569,896,agent_2,"i should know this stuff . i have a sibling in san francisco , but i'm not big into basaketball or footbal myself , thought i do know all abou5 the pats and tom brady !"
19570,896,agent_1,"steph curry is prsttuy much the tom brady of the nlf right now , he's the player you want in the big game . it was fun talking sports with you , have a great day !"
19571,896,agent_2,"nice tazlking with you , too !"

19575,897,agent_2,"oh ok , i will have to check it out . do you know much about the usa congress ?"
19576,897,agent_1,a litle . i kno wthere are three subway lines exclusively for congressmen to move between the capitol and offices .
19577,897,agent_2,yeah isn't that an interesting fact . i wonder what year and wyy they decid3d to come up with that .
19578,897,agent_1,it is probably a recent thing . certainly after the start of th eannual republican or democrat baseblal game in 1909 .
19579,897,agent_2,that woulkd actually be pretty fun to watch or go back in time and watch soem of those games in the early 1900's .
19580,897,agent_1,"i would like to see the one from 1916 , wjhen the firstw oman was elected to cohgress ."
19581,897,agent_2,yeha i woupd like to see that as well . i ould likke to see how fast they pitch to each other !
19582,897,agent_1,not sure . did you know ther eis also a fantasy congress league !
19583,897,agent_2,"rea;lly , i wonder how you would even score poitns i a league like tyat . can you imagine people getting ijto a fight over their fantasy congress league as well ?"
19584,897,agent_1,"poinhts are based off of legislative success . i know if i were in a fight over a fantasy league , i would take of my boots !"
19585,897,agent_2,that is just too funny to me . did you know the elmo once testified before congress ?
19586,897,agent_1,that is pretty runny . does elmo wear ubg boots ?
19587,897,agent_2,"that i can't tell tyou , but io do't knpw why he would hage to come in 9r at least the character , but i think i remember when that happened actually ."
19588,897,agent_1,true . k know some of the muppets would wear ruber boots like those nokia used tom ake .
19589,897,agent_2,"yea i never knew that about nokia , who would have thouvht . ig uess tyey still make them ."
19590,897,agent_1,i wonder if they ever made boots or turkeys ! aq uarter million rurkeys used to be walked from norfolk to london in custom boots .
19591,897,agent_2,"really , i wonder why in the world that would happen ! but i guess peopl eare reakly weirda dn do weird things for fun ."
19592,897,agent_1,"it was probably the easiest way to transport them ? i agree , its ounds like something out of literature ."
19593,897,agent_2,"yeah it does . well it was nice cahtting with you today , 8 hope you have a good day ."
19594,898,agent_1,"hi there , ahat kind of footwear do y6ou like ?"

19597,898,agent_2,i have ! i surf occasionally and they hlep keep my feet wsarm .
19598,898,agent_1,do you know how they were invented ?
19599,898,agent_2,i think i ngeneral surfers invented them 6o oeep their feet warm afte getting out of the ocean . they certainly work !
19600,898,agent_1,yeah . do you know what 'pullinbg oneself up by the bootstrap'smeans ?
19601,898,agent_2,"i bleieve ot's based off of doing something pretty much impossible , you really can't actially pull tourself up by bootstraps ."
19602,898,agent_1,"yeah , exactly . did you know noki zo0riginally amde boots ?"
19603,898,agent_2,"i didn' tknow that , do you know if they still do that ?"
19604,898,agent_1,they still maek rubber boots yes
19605,898,agent_2,boots have a lot of interesting history in general . i believe the first people to ever be photogrfaphed were a man and the cleqner cl3aning his boots .
19606,898,agent_1,"yes , i thibk that is cprrect . do you like literature ?"
19607,898,agent_2,"i definitely do , i think literature is a forgotten form of arf . it actually used to be an olympic event for some time ."
19608,898,agent_1,"yeah that is so cool , it still shouldb e , along wiht musi cpainting and sculpture"
19609,898,agent_2,there's still contests for it though . i know there's an annual contest that challenges wriyers to come up with the worst pissibel opening sentence to a book .
19610,898,agent_1,i would like to read those really . di dyou kow the fda burned six tons of books in an act of usc ensorsbip ?
19611,898,agent_2,"i didn't know that , tha'ts awful . reading has experienced a lot of changes . i heard romantic kissing is still a new development in reading ."
19612,898,agent_1,yeah it seems so . in ancient greek literature it was rarely mentioned
19613,898,agent_2,the state of literature has ceryainly improved now . winsaton churchill once won a nobel peace prize for literat6ure .
19614,898,agent_1,"go figure , htat guy was talneted really . nice chatting with you"
19615,899,agent_1,i know a lot of people may not but i actually enjoy reading shakespeare . how about yourelf ?
19616,899,agent_2,the actress olivia wilde changed her name as aw trjbute to the irish poet and playwright . a nice tribute yes ?
19617,899,agent_1,a frry nice tribute . id id not knot hat . were you aware that shakespeare invented many of the hbrases we use today such as ' good riddance ' 'l aughing stock ' ' devil incarnate ' and ' as luck wold have it ' ?
19618,899,agent_2,shakespeare has a largw body of work that we can read . 39 plays . i find the language a little difficult at tkmes . there are some hidden jokes that are clever puns . they get lost as english changes .
19619,899,agent_1,it's always jard when starting but you get caught in the rhythm pretty quickly . it's hard to believe that he was alive at the samet ime ad pocahontas .
19620,899,agent_2,"laas , poor pocahotna , i knw her well . i would like the idea og my skullb eing used in hamlet to play yorick . it would be funny , but i would know nothing ."
19621,899,agent_1,"ha ha , hamlet is probably my favorite shakespeare work . i revisited it in college andl oved it . i was very surprised to learn that he invented the names miranda , jessica , and olivia . we use those names so much now and thyey seem so simple compared to moat of his names ."
19622,899,agent_2,i wonder if we r3ally know the man shakespeare was ? there are few recirds . we read his works and presum to know hwat he thougjt . few records for commoners from the day . unlike our lives which will have records forever .
19623,899,agent_1,that's a good question . i would be interested in learning more about that . we al3ays think of drama with shakespeare nbut he also wrote comedies . do you enjot comedies ?
19624,899,agent_2,"i always appreciate comedy . have learned that some mocies are referred to as romatic comedies . i dont like the name , do like 6the movie . harold and kumar was funny ."
19625,899,agent_1,i like lots of thosxe . i like step brothers and i love you man a lot . i like cemetri martin's standup . he was accepted into harvard lqw school but decided to do standup instead . he always seemed very intelligent to me .
19626,899,agent_2,"i do not know who demetri martin is . droppjng out o fschoo lto pursue comedy is a comkon thing hough , ryan stiles is a funny guy . he was on the drew cary show a while ago ."
19627,899,agent_1,"i definitely remember him . tall , slim man . i love nill murray so much . are you a fan ?"
19628,899,agent_2,bill muray is the man . dogs an dcwts sleeping toether . i have never watchedd kung fu hustle . i need to loo kfor that . you know it ?
19629,899,agent_1,eh is amazing . he is a huge fan of kung fu hustle ; i have seen it . it's okay but i'm going to have to disagree with him on how glod it is . it's reallu not that great .
19630,899,agent_2,"i will keep that in mind . there are many levels to comedy . some is pure visual , some is strictly words . it is funny to hink about the three stooges , buster keton , slapstic kwith and withojt words ."
19631,899,agent_1,that is true . kung fu hustle is very visuql and slspstick heavy . i realized that 3rd rock from the su naon the olden globe for best comedy series in 1997 . that is surprising .
19632,899,agent_2,"3rd rock beating seinfeld , friends and frasier . four grea comedy shows airing in the same year . network tv was at its height . now thingys are fractured by internet channels . great show though ."
19633,899,agent_1,i did enjoy it but it certainly did not hold up as well as seinfeld or maybe even friends .
19634,899,agent_2,"i do agree that 3rd rck is mot showing in reruns . seinfeld , friends and even frasier live on in reruns . seriously , i still see them while channel suhrfing . anyway , i hwve nothing to declare by my genius ."
19635,899,agent_1,i definitely agree . i believe that you just quoted oscar wilde . great quote .
19636,900,agent_1,hi how are you ? are you a fan of bill syhakespeare ?
19637,900,agent_2,"yes i do like shakespeare , ven though he wqs born a long time ago i think he was very talented , it's crazy taht he was born in 1564 !"
19638,900,agent_1,he was alive during the time of queen elizabeth . i dont know how he managed to write everything eh id . did he sleep ? i wonder .
19639,900,agent_2,yeah he is bery famous though . he's caleld englnad's national poet and sometimes even the ' bard of avon ;' which i've never heard before
19640,900,agent_1,the bard is a nickanme that i heard before . i read his stuff gut it was a grea experience to see it performed .
19641,900,agent_2,"yes i agree , it's crazy that when his work is actually performed in a period accurate accentt hat the rhymes will wprk better"
19642,900,agent_1,i bet the language has changed much since his day . the language can fee impenetrable .
19643,900,agent_2,"yes i agree , i didn't like reaeing shakespeare as a kid but now i kind of appreciate it . and it's crazy how h ewould make grammatical eerrors ib order to heighten attention to whqat was going on , that's very genius"
19644,900,agent_1,he had a genius understanding of language . the words h3c reated just seemed to have the right sound and meaning . he changed language singlehandedly .
19645,900,agent_2,"yes if only he hax lived longer , i wonder what other inventions of the english language he cohuld have made , he died a tage 52 apparently"
19646,900,agent_1,"i gueess that was a pretty long life in those days . lots of disease , problems with sanitaton . he could have died much younger . w3 are very fortunate ."
19647,900,agent_2,"yes i agree , on a happier note though do you ever wtch any comedies ? that could inclujde black comedies as well"
19648,900,agent_1,"i like comedies , including black comedies , and hromances too . you ?"
19649,900,agent_2,"well i l.ike old school stuff like monty python hahq . and iy's crazy that graham chapman , who was in monty python , was originally going to be a medical docto rbut gave it up to oursue comedy"
19650,900,agent_1,graham was veryb right l and quite funny . unfortunately he had a serious drinking problem . i really miss him .
19651,900,agent_2,"oh wow i di not know about the drinking . one station i did like a lot was comedy cebn6ral , it doesn't surprise me that they csnceled over 100 shows since they got started , they seemt o always cancel the shlws that i like"
19652,900,agent_1,"they have not canceled south park , thank god . i would not be avle tog o without that show every fall . i a maddicted ."
19653,900,agent_2,yep that's the only show on there that i watch now . did you ever see the movie green lantdrn by the wayh ? apparently it was going to star jack black an di think thqtw ould have been better than ryan reynolds
19654,900,agent_1,"yeah , jack black is a natural comedian . i never saw green lantern . anyway ,g reat chat !"
19655,900,agent_2,"yes you ar ean excellent chat pargner . and make sure to check out wrk from oscar widle , he actually did some wonderful plays"

19671,901,agent_2,"ya , plus if you know what happened in real life , it ind of take steh drama out of the movie , i guess to hanks personally refunded money for one of his movies when a crowd said htey didn't lik eit haha , nice guy"
19672,901,agent_1,he's so much nice than i would haveb een . not sure i woul dhave sent them money . proably would have been something more immature .

19737,904,agent_1,his role in aing kmr bnaks is the first time someone has played diney in a maijnstream film ? tha5t's weird !
19738,904,agent_2,i wonder why no one has playedw alt dinsey bhef9re ?
19739,904,agent_1,i know . . . i would have thought it wads played in a movie before then .b ut it's tomh anks and he can do anything !
19740,904,agent_2,very true . do you know how he ends his emails ?
19741,904,agent_1,"no , how ?"

19746,905,agent_2,i love all the super hero movies but black panther might be my favorite . did you know dorothy steel made her film debut in this movie ? and she is 91 !
19747,905,agent_1,"no way , ih ad no idea ! that is a pretty neatt hing to get off a bucket list at 91 yrs ole . i ehare that the richest superhero is the blak panther , who is estimated 500 billion . brue wayhe is only at 80 million and been around a lot onger ."
19748,905,agent_2,that is impressive ! are you a tom hanks fan ?
19749,905,agent_1,"yes , he cracks me up ! i like that he refuses to play bad guys in the movies he chooses ."
19750,905,agent_2,"yeah , he has been in so many gresa tmovies . i really liek big and the green mile . do you have a favorite ?"
19751,905,agent_1,that is true . h3e has so man great movies but i really lpoved mr . banks . that was his more recent film and the first actor top play walt disney in a mainstream film .
19752,905,agent_2,i haven't seen that one ye . how uis walt disney portrayed in that movie ?
19753,905,agent_1,it was a very nice feel good movie with a hstkrical feel . tom hanks has over 8 . 5 billion in worldwide film earnings . he is actually the highest alltime box office star .
19754,905,agent_2,i would think he would be . he has been in the so many grewat high grossing movies . i have seen most of his movies and the only one i did not like was turne rand hooch .
19755,905,agent_1,"yeah , good point and that was a lojng time ago . you never know what movie will be a hit . dor instance the movie trojan wars only grossed 309 but had a budge toft 15 billion"
19756,905,agent_2,it is hard to predict hwat will be a hit . i heard tom hanks was originally casdt as mario in a super mario movid . i don't think that would havce been good for his career .
19757,905,agent_1,"ha , oh funny and i agree with you . diseny has also had some hits and flops . the disney movi etreasure palnet was the most expejsive flop of all time sfor them . i never saw it though ."

19768,906,agent_1,nh has a hyphen because stan lee didn't wznt him confused with superman . i guess i wrote it wrong . should be spiderman .
19769,906,agent_2,"that's pretty interesting , stan lee wzs an amazing ma n. did you know that in 1998 marvel offered the cinematic rights to all of it's characters to sony for a mer e25 million ?"
19770,906,agent_1,yeah and sony rejected it and only bought the rights to spiderman !
19771,906,agent_2,"that's crazy , bu i think they both did well on the deal ."
19772,906,agent_1,do you know madame web ? sta nlee's wifw did her voice in hte 94 spiderman series .
19773,906,agent_2,i didn't know that . did you know the broadway mjsical ' spiderman : turn off the dark ' is fhe most expensive productio nin broadway history ?
19774,906,agent_1,"seems liket he music would be good . too badt her ewere too many injures on set , swo fhat they had to shut down bwcause they couldn't get injury insurance anymore ."
19775,906,agent_2,yeha the music and lyrics wefe written by bono sasn't it ?
19776,906,agent_1,"yeah , i heard that . suerheroes cause a lot of damage in their unierse . there was a comic series about fixing their collateral damage ."
19777,906,agent_2,that's pretty coil . rid you know there is actually a superhero called 'n ormalman ? '
19778,906,agent_1,hat can he do ?
19779,906,agent_2,"basically nothing , he was the only person without superpowers on a planet full of superheroes ."
19780,906,agent_1,"wow , i'd be nervous if i wee him . in real life there are also 3400 registered superheroes . wonder whatis needed to register ."
19781,906,agent_2,"i'm not sure , that does seem like alpt ."
19782,906,agent_1,"my kids like this garfield book series spinoff , called pet force . garfield and the gang are superheros . hav eyou heard of it ?"
19783,906,agent_2,"i have not , it sounds pretty fnny l i'll havet o check it out !"

19788,907,agent_2,"hi , how qre uou ? i like music , too . hwat genre do you like ? jazz ?"
19789,907,agent_1,"i do liek jazz , what about you ?"
19790,907,agent_2,"jazz is great ! there are some fans out htere i would not have suspected , like clint 4astwood , a lifelong jazz enthusiast ,"
19791,907,agent_1,"yeah , i think i saw him play the piano in several films some od them had jazz songs ."
19792,907,agent_2,"clint is great ! he is not much of a singer though . on a related note , i'm astonished that pakistsn has a jazz orchewtra . i did not imagine jazz as popular in that part of the world ."
19793,907,agent_1,"pakistan has an orchestra ? that is an interesting fact indeed , do you know why trumpeter4s grew goa5ees ?"
19794,907,agent_2,jazz trumpeters grew goatees becayuse they orovide c9mfort when playign . i guess clariner players don't need it . then again steven spielberg played the claribet in the jaws soundtrack and he has facial hair .
19795,907,agent_1,"he djd ? thats w c0ool fact , i didnt know he was behind that scary soundtrack , did you watch thew movie tron ?"
19796,907,agent_2,"no , i never saw the movie tron ."
19797,907,agent_1,"i see we;l if you ever see it pay attention to the soundtrack , daft punk is the band that plays it ."
19798,907,agent_2,"did you know ed sheeran ? he says that eminem i sone of his biggest musical infcluences . i don't really know eminem . ed has a better vocal range than freddie mercury , and that's saying somethin g."
19799,907,agent_1,"really ? no wonderw hy his voice is so good , you know her ecorde dtje song i see fire for the hobbit movie in barely a day"
19800,907,agent_2,"i wonder how many other soundtracks he's been on . ed wrote the song ' love yourself ' but thought it wouldn't fif his album , so he gave it to ieber . 5hat's a strange choice . why bieber , and not another singer ?"
19801,907,agent_1,"maybe they are friends or he owed bieber s favor or maybe theres somehting else going on only the two of them know , but it does seem weird"
19802,907,agent_2,"ed certaijly had a rough start to his career ? after h4 finished his music course , he couch surfed for 2 . 5 f years , slept outsie buckingham palae and slept on the undsrground ."
19803,907,agent_1,"wow he sure had it tough , many artists see mto fight a lot to get to the top , i bet he sang on buses nad public tranportation , people didnt know he waz going t become as big of an artis5 as he is now"
19804,907,agent_2,i shouldl earn more about his music . i know he's got tons ofc ash now . i wonder what kind of compositions ed would come up with in the progrmaming language in which the programs are written in musical composition .

19812,908,agent_1,wow that is a lot . i heard there is sa comic about fixing the collateral damage causxed by the superheros . i bet that is a funny one .
19813,908,agent_2,"i was thinkinv the same . lol , have you see hte normlaman superhero ?"
19814,908,agent_1,no . what ia his power or lack ther3e of ?

19818,908,agent_1,"ahh . garfield . i loved thos ecartoons . 9die , nermal . that would be great !"
19819,908,agent_2,so cute ! so stan lee needed that hyphen in spiderman so there was't any confusion .
19820,908,agent_1,there is even a marvel superhero with hearing aids ! they created one because a little boy believed superheros dony wear them so they created them .
19821,908,agent_2,"awww , i love that ! that will be a great one for the kids !"
19822,908,agent_1,i think thjat is great 5hat they help out teh world like that ;
19823,908,agent_2,so agre e. stan lee's wife joan was the voice of madame web in the spiderman series .
19824,908,agent_1,that is neat . marvel even argued in court that mutants arent people so they got to pay lower rates on toys .
19825,908,agent_2,"relly , surprised . walt disney world acquired marvel entertainment ,b ut doesn' thave the rights the big , xmen and toys ."
19826,908,agent_1,i didnt knw disney acquired them . that is pretty neat . it is like dosney owns everything
19827,908,agent_2,"lol , i know , disney and universalg o back and forth , its crazy ! great chat ! !"
19828,908,agent_1,hav ea great day .
19829,909,agent_1,hello ! are you a spideran fan .
19830,909,agent_2,"i'm not big into superehroes , but he's pretty cool . tey made a spiderman musical and it was the most expensive bnroadway show , ever !"
19831,909,agent_1,that is crazy . i heardt hat it was 75 milliln . i wonxer wha tmadre it that high .
19832,909,agent_2,"those are some expensive spider wbs !m arvel s0ld spiderman to sony in 1998 . thdy offered to sell the other characters , bu sony declined ."
19833,909,agent_1,i was surprised by that . i learend that it was because they believed that movie audiences would only care about him . which is probably true .
19834,909,agent_2,"i don't know ,s eems to be a ton of superhero movies out lately ! hard to helieve marve lstarted under another name way back in 1939 !"
19835,909,agent_1,ity is crazy to think that there are over 30p registered superheroes in the united states . i 2onder how many come from marvel .
19836,909,agent_2,"probably a lot . i know they hav ehulk , thor , deadpool , and iron man just to name a few ."
19837,909,agent_1,i think one of the funniest superhnero's i heard abouit is normalman . he ist eh only person withou tsuperpowers on a planet full of superheroes .
19838,909,agent_2,thats' pretty funny . disney owns marvel no which is a neat collaboration .
19839,909,agent_1,they are also great for the community . marvel created a superhero to help a boy feel more comfortable about his hearing aids .
19840,909,agent_2,i heard aboutt hat ! he was called blue ear . so cool !
19841,909,agent_1,the boy told his mom superheroes dont wea4 hearing aids so amrvel created one . that is so inspieing
19842,909,agent_2,he was only 4 ears old ! i'm sure he loved it !
19843,909,agent_1,it is bizarre that disney cannot show big mzrvel characters in theme parsk .
19844,909,agent_2,"yeah , they have some old agreement with universal abou tthat ."
19845,909,agent_1,"yes , back in the 90s they signed ."
19846,909,agent_2,"no avengers at disney world , i guess !"
19847,909,agent_1,"yes , also they wern to court to sah thazt mutants re not people ."
19848,909,agent_2,so they could get cheaper rate on the toys the sell . not a bad idea ! thanks for chatting !
19849,910,agent_1,hi good afternoon ! do you like spiderman ? like other marvel hcaracters he was created by stan lees .
19850,910,agent_2,hi ! yes ! i love all the superhero movies ! dtan ele was so creative an amazing he did such great work within the marvel company

19854,910,agent_2,"oh cool ! speaking of spiderman , appwrently sony bought the rihgts for 10 mill but they only wanbted spiderman and rjeected the offer to bhuy all for 25m ill . . . i wonder if they regret it now"
19855,910,agent_1,yes i bet sony wished they could buy the est of teh cnaracters righ tnow . but at least they haqge spiderman .
19856,910,agent_2,"yes , it feels like it was just yesterday but htis was back in 1998 so im sure they are worth way more now ."
19857,910,agent_1,o yes and no douht .a ctually the most expensive production in broazdway history was he broadway musical spiderman : turn off the dark .
19858,910,agent_2,"interesting , i can see how people can relate or want to be a superhero in rweal life . did you know therea re over 300 registerded superheroes in the us ."
19859,910,agent_1,"well i am definitely not one of the, lol . there's actually comic series abou6t fixing the collateral damage caused by superheroes . have you heard of that ?"

19874,911,agent_1,"i'll havfe to kisten to that . i do like clint eastwood movies and i a,ways like the scores in his movies , apparently he wrote some of the jazz music for htem"
19875,911,agent_2,he has ? so he not only is a great actor but also a talented musician ?
19876,911,agent_1,yes exactly . i wonder if h eever performed at that woman's house in harlem ? she putx on a jazz concert every weekend in her apartment
19877,911,agent_2,"that amazing , i bet her neighbos really liked that , i know i would"
19878,911,agent_1,i would liike it as long as it's not too late lol . i would want to be able to sleep if i gad you . i'm a programmer too and i cidn't realize that there is a programming language that will make aj azz melody if all of the conditions are mt correftly
19879,911,agent_2,"you are a programmer , thats amazing , and yeah it seems like jazz inspires many people adn also things"
19880,911,agent_1,"yes jaz is a great thing i think . if i ever learn the tr8mpet i would gro wa goatee though , people use that to make it more comfortable when playing apparently"
19881,911,agent_2,"ivea lways wondered about those goatees , 5hey look a bit rediculous but its nice tok n0w they have a purpose"
19882,911,agent_1,yes i agree ! what movie has your favorite soundtrack by hte way ? i always lik ethe jaw theme myself
19883,911,agent_2,"i like gbe soundtrack fromb atman begisn , but the soubdtrack from jaws still give me the creeps"
19884,911,agent_1,"it's funny in the soundtrack for jaws thougj , apparently steven spieberg plays the clarinwt lol"
19885,911,agent_2,"he does ? that is fumny , so the clanient from the movie was spjleberg , i guess he is a man with many talents"
19886,911,agent_1,"yes he is ! have you seen the movie o bvrother where art thou ? it has great soundtrack 2 , it was certified 8 times platinum"
19887,911,agent_2,"no , havent seen that movie , the soundtrack must be great to be certified platinum 8 times"
19888,911,agent_1,"ueah the soundtrack is really good . also you mntioned the soundt4rack to batmanb egins , each name on th4 soundtrack is actually the name of a gejus of bat which is interesting"
19889,911,agent_2,"i never paid attention to htat , another talented artist is ed sheeran do you like his music¡"
19890,911,agent_1,"no i haven't listened to hi smusic much . apparently eminem ia a big ifnluence on him though , i do like eminem"
19891,912,agent_1,jazz originated from new orl3ans in the late 19th century .
19892,912,agent_2,"it developled from r9ots in blues and ragtime musif , that was a little surprising to me ."
19893,912,agent_1,"it came into it's own in the 1920's , being seen as a mahor form of music ."
19894,912,agent_2,"towards the end of the 1940's a more calmer , s,oother sound was introduced ."
19895,912,agent_1,what became known as ' cool jazz ' . i think i definitely prefer thea ft4r 1940's sound .
19896,912,agent_2,"i like the sound of ed sheerans; music ,s urprised to see rhat he wrote ' love yourself '"
19897,912,agent_1,"i'm not familiar with him , he's so young , born in 1991 !"
19898,912,agent_2,"he has quite the workload , being singer , songwriter , guitarist , record producer and actor !"
19899,912,agent_1,"people have such varied talents , steven spiekberg actually plays the clarinet in the jaws soundtrack ."
19900,912,agent_2,"that is impressive ! jst like ;hil collins recording verskons of the tarzan soundtrack in ita;ia n, grman , spanish and french ."
19901,912,agent_1,i barely mastered english ! speakibg of music there is a harlem woman who has hosted jazz concerts every suneay for free .
19902,912,agent_2,"wow that sounds fun , i wodner if any big nmes have taken part in that ."
19903,912,agent_1,"leiter performers do stop by , i don't hink any jazz musician can truly be considered a big name , they're just not well known ."
19904,912,agent_2,"i couldn't name a jazz musician . jazz trumpeters are known to grow goatees , for comfort while playing ."
19905,912,agent_1,"that's so weird , i wonder why ."
19906,912,agent_2,"i have no experience , but maybe zsomething to o with where the instrument hits around the mouth ?"
19907,912,agent_1,it's as strnage as a pakistani jaxz orchestra !
19908,912,agent_2,"appartently they're topping the chart s, who would hav eknown !"
19909,912,agent_1,"the soundtrack to o brother , where art thou ? snashed the charts , goign eght times platinum !"
19910,912,agent_2,"impressive , i have never heard any f that soundtrack"
19911,912,agent_1,i bet we have and just didn't know it was from that .
19912,912,agent_2,that is very possible
19913,912,agent_1,good chat ! thanks !
19914,913,agent_1,i find the universe to be utterly fascinating . how about yourself ?
19915,913,agent_2,"of course , the universe covers many secrets . i'm very ager to know about it ."
19916,913,agent_1,it definitley does . there are scientistsw hno theorize that universes evolve throuhg natural selevtion much like different species do on earth . so that would mean some weaker aspect die off in ravor of stronger ones ? that's very interesting .
19917,913,agent_2,"yes , uhniversal darwinism refers to a variety of approaches that extend the theory of darwinism beyonhd its original dom,ain of biological evolution on earth ."
19918,913,agent_1,i never thought that could apply to the universe as a whole . a lot of theories are hzdd to wrap your head around . like the theair that the univese may be one giant hologram !
19919,913,agent_2,"i think typically , a holofram is a photographic recording of a light field , rather thj of an image formed by a lens ."
19920,913,agent_1,ye sit just seems like an unbelievable theory in thisc ase . thdre is another theory that the5e is only one electron in the entire universe . hoe is that remotely possible ?
19921,913,agent_2,i don't knhow about that details . but it was very interestingy .
19922,913,agent_1,"wlel all atoms are made of protons , neutrons , and electrons . atoms are the building blocks of evdrything and each onec ontains electrons so how could on3 theorize that there is only one elecrron in the universe ?"
19923,913,agent_2,"yes , when the electron is moving backwards in time , it's a positron , the antimatter counterpart of the electron ."
19924,913,agent_1,"who a. interesting . here's wnother surprising one . there are stars in the universe that are codl enought o be touched by hte humab hand . given that our sun is a star and we kjow ho whot htar is , that's a shocking fact aqs well ."
19925,913,agent_2,okay that's nice . do you like any superhero ?
19926,913,agent_1,i don't have a favorite but there are several that i like . how about yourself ?
19927,913,agent_2,such talented actors are he superheroes too .
19928,913,agent_1,yew most of rhe superhero movies now featurev ery talented actlrs . were you aware that there are over 300 registered superheroes in the united states ?

19931,913,agent_2,"yes , these ;eoplea re mindful of people ."
19932,913,agent_1,psylocke nad jessica jones are very conflicted charactersa nd i like that they are more complex . i'm less of a fan of good only character slike superman . but all superheroes cause a lot of dmaage and there as actually once a comic series about fixingt he collateral damage caused by superheroes .
19933,913,agent_2,"superman is a fictional supwrhero , me also like superman ."

19935,914,agent_1,good mornin g! isn't the umiverse a crazy thing . teh spatial size of the entire universe isn't even known .
19936,914,agent_2,it blows my mind to think about it ! we ttuly are just so tiny in comparison to everything else
19937,914,agent_1,you're so right . the earliest scidntific models of the universe were develoed by ancient greek and idnian philosophers . ver6y haead of their time .
19938,914,agent_2,wow . there's also a theory that there's only one electron in the universe . that sounds kind of wild to me

19945,914,agent_1,i agree i would love to do that . jnot sure if it's been done before . i wonder if the universe evolves throughn atural selection like species 9n earth do ?
19946,914,agent_2,"i'm thinkin prfobably noit , since there is not intervention from other species and it doesnts eem like much changes up there asid from sciencey stuff . but what do i know !"

20000,917,agent_2,"it dosn't matter what a woman wears , somrone is going to get attention ."
20001,917,agent_1,wanted amd unwanted attention ! they somet6imes get catczlls while jogging in sweat pants .
20002,917,agent_2,i don't know juch about koppel . i know lots 9of men in the news biz have been busted for sexist and harassing behavior .
20003,917,agent_1,"he is 78 , so from the ' old schooo ' . so i wonder if he excuses beavior that is not acceptable today ."
20004,917,agent_2,"taht sort of behavior is no tneeded i9ntg he workplace , whic is where we get work done . did you kmnow that the tshirt was invente din 1904 and marketed to bachelors who couldn't sew or replace b7u5ttons ?"
20005,917,agent_1,that tshirt fact makes sense . i havew orked a bit in hawaii where the aloha shurt is business attire even abkc in the dy ahen a suit and tie was more common on the mainland .
20006,917,agent_2,i like that levi's jeans helped create casual fridays inw orkplaces all over the world . smae spirit as the alo9ha spirit in hawaii .
20007,917,agent_1,"true . in ow live in hoenix . i think we adopted less formal dress pretty fast because of the heat . clothing sends messages . in china , layered shirts used to mean gaby fashion ."
20008,917,agent_2,that's a smart move in a place like phoenix . do you all wear jeasn in thath eat ? i'll tkae note of that chinese fashion guideline .
20009,917,agent_1,whorts are pretty common . i go to a baptist church and only wear long pnatsa bout 8 weeks in december and january . there are lots of jeans this time of year . ladies wear the skin tigth .
20010,917,agent_2,what ? ! skin tight jeans ! ted koppel ould ay those arde just like short skirts ! lol .
20011,917,agent_1,perhaps ! did you now that th esmall pocket in ueane was designed for pocket watches ?
20012,917,agent_2,usually kids us ethose to put their boogers in . they call it their ' booger bank . '? it's funny that blue jeans are outlawed in norht korea becwuse thy are a symbol of mnaerican imperialism . i'm an imperialist ! '
20013,917,agent_1,in ever hear that sabout the watch poket and i hope i can erase it from my mind ! levi did a great marketign move by making a denim tuxedo for bing crosby when he was turned away from a hotel for wearing jeans .
20014,917,agent_2,"jeans are totally whol3some ! a stusent wore the same pzair of jeans for 15 month s. that student livee , a sdid everyone inh is wchool !"
20015,917,agent_1,surely there was some washing in the 15 monyhs . we called them blue jeans when i was in school and i loved tue new levi's a tthe start of each year . now the premium jeans are made to look wkrn when they are new .
20016,917,agent_2,didn't wash them ! the same amount of germw as at 13 days of wear . i think jeans might be the safesat clothes to wear .
20017,917,agent_1,wow ! i would think the smell would be awful . perhaps he was totally inactive and did not sweat . ther3 are abput ahlf a dozen jeans brands copwned byw rangler .
20018,917,agent_2,"never worn the wrangler . usually levi's . they don't cheat like old navy , which markets jeans with a 41 ' waist as 36 '"
20019,917,agent_1,"i did not know that . i have had nerve damage from my metal watch band being go tight when lifting things , so i can understand how skinny jeans could cause nerve dwamage . nice talk !"
20020,918,agent_1,hi how are you ?d o you like superheroes ?
20021,918,agent_2,i do love superheroez ! do you have a favorite one ?
20022,918,agent_1,i dont know much abou tsuperheroes . i did like a couple of the spiderman movies .
20023,918,agent_2,they wer goo . there are plenty of supoerheroes to pick from as therea rd over 300 of them registered in the united states .
20024,918,agent_1,i wonder jow oen goes about registering a superhero . could i make up a eho and get it registrred ?
20025,918,agent_2,"i'm thinking you could . kind of like when a musician writes a sogna nd gets it registered . i'k sur eit's the same thing with graphic designs , ideas , etc . i think the funniest superhero ever is nodmalmanm . he was the only person without superpowers on a planet full of superheroes . lol"
20026,918,agent_1,i wonder who came up with ythat character . what does that character do all day ? i guess it could be an interesting setting for strange stories .
20027,918,agent_2,i talmost sounds like tat ghey came up with that character after struggling to come up with a new superhero with special super powers . i think they were digging the bottom of the barrel with normalman . lol
20028,918,agent_1,"yeah , tge superpowers get a bit stale . the backstories start to sound hte same . i dotn watch superhero films because i5 seems to be all specia lfx ."
20029,918,agent_2,you're right there . even garfieldh ad a superhero sponoff series named pet force .
20030,918,agent_1,"i think htey are geting desperate for content . i guess if the story isg ood , then i would watch it . but explosions are just not jnteresting to me ."
20031,918,agent_2,the graphics seem to me to be too faske looking now and even the digitsl enhajced landscapes don't look real .
20032,918,agent_1,"for an older audience , the characters and plot need to be developed . i liked the second spiderman for that reasxon . the comic book fil mfor people that dont read comic booms ."
20033,918,agent_2,speraking of spideramn and comic books . sad that stan lee passed away recently . he used to end every hone conversatio nhe had with the word ' excelsior ! '
20034,918,agent_1,he lived to age 95 . a good long life . he amde a million a year just for staying alive . lo l.
20035,918,agent_2,lol did you ever hear og amnga comics ? by 1995 the manga market ijn japan was valued at 6 to 7 billion dollars . holy cow ! that was like 15 years before it exploded here in the states .
20036,918,agent_1,"yeah , the comic industry is big there . not much money for the people at the bottom . long hours , low pay but many many fans ."
20037,918,agent_2,i didn't know tyat . did you know that dc from dc comics stands for detectife comcs ?
20038,918,agent_1,"yeah , i heard that . detective comics comics . what ? ! vey creative therew . anyway , great chat !"
20039,918,agent_2,i had a good time learning about these comic books . next time i'm driving by the michigan state university library i;m going to have to stop in and browse their comic book collection which is the largest in the worl d !lol havs a great night !
20040,918,agent_1,have a vreat night too !
20041,918,agent_2,thanks for chatting !
20042,919,agent_1,i am a big fan o fliterature an ddeading is one of my hobbies . do you enjoy books ?
20043,919,agent_2,it's a funny thing . i used to read a lot but these days i spend more time listening to music but i have been thinking about getting back imnto the reading . who are some o fyour fav authors .
20044,919,agent_1,"i enjoy orwell , vonnegut , ira levin , stephen kibg . taht's ton ame a few . apparently at one point the fda burned 6 toms of literature in ana ct of censirship . i find that very depressing ."
20045,919,agent_2,i read almost every one of vonnegut's books a few years ago . i even read his very earliest works before he became so famous . definitely a unique talent .
20046,919,agent_1,i love the way he writes . it's somehow simple and profound at the same time . it's so insightfulp ithoyt ever feeling pretentious . i don't know how he did i t. je made the complex simple .
20047,919,agent_2,peefectly stated . there are times i5's almost like reading a book for children . yet he is incredibly profound . is he stil.l alive ?
20048,919,agent_1,no unfortunately he fell ofr a ladder in his older age an dpassed away . i actually chose to decorate my living room in framed book quotes and he has the mosdt spots . i know that fahrenheit 451 was banned in schools several times .
20049,919,agent_2,i read so many of his books in sucvh a short period of time that tehy all sort of run together . remind me about farenheit 451 .
20050,919,agent_1,fahrenheit 451 is about billy pilgrim who was a soldier and pow when he was young and an optometrist later in life . he becomes unsuck in time and life becomes nonlinear .
20051,919,agent_2,"8t is vague to m ebut i sor of recall readuing it . and of course ' breakfast of hcmapions . ' going back to your remark about the fda burning tons of literature , yes it is depr4ssing ."
20052,919,agent_1,"i apolog9ze so much . i realized as soon as i typed it htat my title sare switched . i was still thinking about burning books as a form of censorship which is the plot o ffahrenheit 451 by rwy bradbury . the vonnegut bo9ok we were discussing is slaughterhousefive . again , so sordy ."
20053,919,agent_2,no problem . i have ehard of bradbury ; not very familar with him . yes slaugtherhousefiv ea fabulous bo0k i remember discusesing it with someone a few years ago . grea t.
20054,919,agent_1,"it is a fantastic book . i do recommend fahrenheit 451 as well . i am often amazed about the books that have been censored . i really can't think of a valid reason to have banned lsaughterhousefive . i don't agree with cenzsoring books at all , but even for tesenagers that seems like a fine bok for them t9 read . shakespeare hasm ore mature themes than that ."
20055,919,agent_2,was slaughterhouse five about concentration camps ? i clearly remmber at least one of his books had very dark overtones gbut valuable to read .
20056,919,agent_1,notr eally . he was a pow in a camp but hew as treated well . unfortunately it was in dresden ands he was there when it was bombed and the csualties were extremely high . several of his books get very dark ;. cat's cradle is a good example of tyings becoming very rark . thaf;s the one where they develop ice 9 which freezes water instantly .
20057,919,agent_2,oaky it's all com8ng back now . my memory isn't as good as it usded to be .w hen i think of censorshipt he first book i thgink about is ' catcher in the rye ' whikch fortunaterly was not censored in my high school . 45 years later and i clearly remember reading thatb ook . it was so different than anything i had read before .
20058,919,agent_1,that is another one4 that i do notg understand banning . meanwhile they had us rrad hamlt where everyone either kills themselves or is murdered . it is very confusing how they made these decisions .
20059,919,agent_2,the only thing i can think of with ' cacher ' is there somes exual scenes and i think tha in soem cases any type of sexual stuff is sort of cpnsidered off limts . and of course those were different times . i read ' catcher ' in the early 9170s .
20060,919,agent_1,i believe many were nanned in the 70's . they seee dto be a bit of a hystrria at some point in ther e.
20061,919,agent_2,yes . pehraps it might have been the after effects of the '60s . cesorship is a veryj udgemental type of thing . groups of people thinking they know best hat people can read . absurd .
20062,919,agent_1,i very mucha geee .
20063,920,agent_1,theres a lot ofc otroiversy goin gon with anti sexual harrasnemt activist nad ted koppel
20064,920,agent_2,ted koppel ? hte news gut ? has he been sexually harassed ? or what ?
20065,920,agent_1,"no , there was just controversy wabout it , his just old fashioned , he is a 78 year old man"
20066,920,agent_2,he is old fashioned about sexual harassment . i guess there is an old way to do it and a new way . he should probably do it the new way .
20067,920,agent_1,"i agree , he should do it the ew way , so you li,e to read ? do you like literaure ?"
20068,920,agent_2,"yes , i rdo . you ?"
20069,920,agent_1,"yeah , i think its ufair how the fda burnes 6 tons of boosk"
20070,920,agent_2,that sounds like the nazis ! i wonder why they did tha t. isn't it illegal in the us ?
20071,920,agent_1,"i guess at th etime it wasnt and taht does sound like a nazi thing , censoeing info from people ,"
20072,920,agent_2,"it's all done to lprotect the naive , the ignorant andt he innocent from themsevles . i should b thanfkul to the fda ."
20073,920,agent_1,books and information are powerfull tools and can be nagserous in the wrong hands
20074,920,agent_2,i should say so ! put them in the hands of the fda and they disappear ! how often do uyou wear shirts ?
20075,920,agent_1,"almost everyday , what about you ? do you wear them often ?"
20076,920,agent_2,shirts can b ecomfortable in public situatjons where people are apt to wear clohing . i fin dshirts constraining in other places . i guess i wear them enouhg to say that it is a habit . i don't know that ic ould breka the habit at this point .
20077,920,agent_1,"yeah i tseems like hsirts are here to stay , i like to wear polo shirts , really comfortable"
20078,920,agent_2,"i do not play polo , so i can't say that i hve much call for the shi4t . but i understand that among the elite , htere is a call for such wear ."
20079,920,agent_1,"well the shirt was invented by tennis players actually , and its uxed in tennis asw ell"
20080,920,agent_2,"oh , they should call it a tennisdso shirt or something , not a pollo shirt . ' pollo ' means chicken in span8sh by the way . that's a strange name for a shirt ."
20081,920,agent_1,"it is a stragne nae i agree with y0ou there , just lik in hcina the have thijs strage culrurap revolution gag"
20082,920,agent_2,"the wor d' china ' in ' chinese ' means strange , so i am not surprised by anything that that country makes , including chicken hsirtes ."
20083,920,agent_1,som ecountries have strage traditions we might seems strange to them tyough
20084,921,agent_1,hello . do you like superheroes ?

20091,921,agent_2,"met oo . my son watches teen titans all the time . i try to turn it off since he i s7 but he likes it and i am not that worried abouf i t, yet ."
20092,921,agent_1,"i wonder if in th eshow they have robin become more of a superhero inh is owj right , instead of just a sidekick ."
20093,921,agent_2,i think so . i have read a lot abou tthe dc channel or website . i think it sounds really interesting with old batman shows on it too .
20094,921,agent_1,yeah batman has been around for a really long time . i think he got started back i 1939 .
20095,921,agent_2,"did you ever watch hose old adam west shows ? i amn too young to have seen them but i used to watch the reruns 2hwen i was younger , like 20 years later ."
20096,921,agent_1,'ve seen some of the reruns too . did you know he had the batman logo put o none of his teeth ?
20097,921,agent_2,"i had n9 idea . how would you like to alip and get caught on your 9wn super power ,l ike condiment kig ."
20098,921,agent_1,condiment king ? what kind of power didh e have that hr slipped on ?
20099,921,agent_2,he shot ketch8p and slipped on hjs own ketchup . batman then caught him . seemw like lijited creativity axk then .
20100,921,agent_1,it really does lol ! abmtan wasn't given any superpowersb y the writers which is odd considering his enemies had them .
20101,921,agent_2,"that i strue ! i alway6s knew about batman' spowers but not his villaisn . accordong to dc canon , new je3rsey ish ome to gotha city ."

20108,922,agent_2,"i thinl so , at least give it a try . yeah he outran death by running past entropy and into the next universe"
20109,922,agent_1,that's pretty cool . i guess the main charafcter's name is allen ? and he uses nis super speed to fight criminals
20110,922,agent_2,yes . he was travelled back in tjme even
20111,922,agent_1,yes and i guesas that this show is a spinoff of the show arrow ? that show before ? also this dhow started back in 2014r . i wpnder how many sewsons there are
20112,922,agent_2,likely 5 seasons ny now . h egy who plays his xad on yh eshow used to play the flash himself
20113,922,agent_1,oh that?s a cool throwback . i guess a bol tof lightning gav ethe flash's ;owees in the first place ? how did that happen exactly haha
20114,922,agent_2,he was hit by a ightninga nd then woke up wiht a bunch of powers like outrunning death
20115,922,agent_1,"i guess death is calles the black flash ? you can also outrun space and time ? one cool thing is that i like deadpool , and a person from deadpoile oes gideons vooce in the flash"
20116,922,agent_2,"nice , there seems to bes om uch overlap . wonder what the collateral damage these guys cause is"
20117,922,agent_1,haha i wonder that too . what do you know about the unive5se ? pretty crazy htat at one point pweopel thought the earth was the center of it
20118,922,agent_2,right ? so much new stuff . some think that the universe is one giant hologram
20119,922,agent_1,i heard that theory . i also heard a theory that there is only obe electron in the whole universe . i have no idea how either pof those would work though haha
20120,922,agent_2,yeah me too . anothe one says that hniverses evolve lie we do
20121,922,agent_1,that is interesting . i want to visit a star that is cold ebough to be touched by the human hand . i guess that does exist s9mewere
20122,922,agent_2,and jt is believed that there is a region that is pullihg galaxies outside of the observable universe
20123,922,agent_1,tgat is crazy ! do you like any superheroes by the way ? i guess they started out in the 1930s
20124,922,agent_2,"i think my favorite is the classic , supermna , how about you ?"
20125,922,agent_1,i like batman a lot myself . but the rest of thes uperheroes i like are all in hd marvel universe . for some reason there are 300 registered superheroes in the united states .
20126,923,agent_1,candice patton didn't realize what starrking on the flash woudl mean playing a role that had been previously played b a white womaj before .
20127,923,agent_2,it's surprising that people were upset with it in this modern day and age .
20128,923,agent_1,tha'ts really a shame she got people acting like that .
20129,923,agent_2,apparently it wasn't a lot but there was a su8bset of people that didn't want to see her in the role .
20130,923,agent_1,changde always is difficult for people .
20131,923,agent_2,that is very true . bvut apparently tje flash has become one fo the network's most popoular sduperhero shows .
20132,923,agent_1,the show id terrific . people have accepted the change now and its set in stone as patton adds
20133,923,agent_2,i haven't actually watched it . i am not really into superhero shows though i did like jessica jones . i will have to check it out .
20134,923,agent_1,schedylinh is hard with superhero hows says patton and tehy do skip some sleep .
20135,923,agent_2,if you were the flash you wouldn't havet o worry about that . the flash can outrun ahd defeat death by outracing it to the end of time and space . seems pretty convenient .
20136,923,agent_1,"yes , he is fast ! the actors though don' tknow how they would have time t6o film a movoe too because they spend time shooting 23 episodes a year ."
20137,923,agent_2,"yes , patton doesn't know how they do it dvery year , buta pparently they do mkae it a successful sho w."
20138,923,agent_1,morenq baccarin from deadpool is gideon's voice in flash
20139,923,agent_2,that is interesting . how ghe flash came fo be is kind of confusing . he became a pure energy in the past and that's what gave him his powers in the firat place .
20140,923,agent_1,"yes , sometimes just best to go with it . did you know there are 300 registere dsuperheroes in the us ?"

20148,924,agent_1,i heard it's really good . i guess they used to name tueir corporation isis until isis became a thing in real life
20149,924,agent_2,that's pretty interesting . i believ eit takes place 8in 1939 and ;remiered in 2010 .
20150,924,agent_1,"yep you're right , thy actually use different gernes for each season apparently for instancer they use a 1940s noiur genre in one season and thent he next one they'll do a comedic 1970s hollywoldt hriller genre"
20151,924,agent_2,"wow , i didn't know that . i'm a little more intrihued to watch it jnow . do you watch anime at all ?"

20163,924,agent_2,htat is really cool . i8 think a lot of pdople in positions of powers hould be more knowledgeable in certain fields like sciecne .
20164,924,agent_1,"yep i agree , what do you tuink about scientist john von neumann though ? he was so smart that at age 6 he could divide two eight digit numbers in his headr"

20254,929,agent_2,"which was a good move for them , they also own etar wars which is a huge franchise !"
20255,929,agent_1,"yea , the funny thing is sony had a chance to buy the film rights to allm arvel characters for 25 million but only bought s0piderman"
20256,929,agent_2,"wow , what an oversight ."
20257,929,agent_1,"yep , sony just paid 10 million for spiderms nbecause they though no one would car eabout the otnher characters"

20261,929,agent_1,"yea , it's a shame that disney world won't be able to have soidermna or avengers rides due to un9versal studios contract ."
20262,929,agent_2,"yeah , i wonder if there was a time limi6t on that contract ? id love for disney to create superhero landc !"

20267,929,agent_1,"yea , too bad marcia lucas wasn't around when lucas came up with that like she was for the origunal star wars"
20268,929,agent_2,she played a bigger role in the movies htan people realize . i am glad she won the academy award for editing !
20269,929,agent_1,"yea , she probably was able toc onvince george lucas not to make han solo a large green alien"

20277,930,agent_2,who do you think shouldh ave played him ? i think casting parts would be extremely difficult to make surte youa ppeal the masse sand are successful with tje movie .
20278,930,agent_1,"ih ave no idea , its a hard role to play heat ledger was my favorite joker , too bad he passed away , he would have gbee na great choice for the movie ."

20282,930,agent_1,"well marvel is now owned by disne3y so that kills to irds with one stone , sony had the chance to buy all of marvel superheroes once and at a really low price ."
20283,930,agent_2,wow ! sony must really be regrettingh that decision ! i heard disney bought marvel but doesn't own the rights to featyre the ' big ' marvel charact6ers in theme parka east o fthe ississippi . i wonder if htey can in disney land in california .

20290,930,agent_1,"that is funny and also a ma7o rmistake on his part , it is the most xuccessful film merchandising franchise , he could eb even more cfamous ."

20296,931,agent_1,"i don't know bu tthat is interewting to consider . astronauts are prety lucky , not justr for gettin gto go out into space bit general motors used to give a free corvette to them wheb they got back go earth ."
20297,931,agent_2,"yea that is lucky but their is some risk , moon dust can cut through spacesuit material and ia bad for hea.lth"
20298,931,agent_1,"it can ct through spacesuit material ? wow . i personally wish everyone could trvel in xspace . there is so much to see and learj about . i mean , there's a water vapor4 cploud in space that has 100 trillikn times more water than all of the water on earth ."
20299,931,agent_2,that's crazy ! japan was able to take a rock samp.e off an asteroid and return it back to earth
20300,931,agent_1,"i wonder what they learned from tue rock sample . there is a lot to be learned here pon earth too though . only 1 , 5 million of the estimated 7 million animal species are known and described ."
20301,931,agent_2,"yea and over a million of them are insects , that's nuts"
20302,931,agent_1,hwo knows what's all out there . we migbt even discover the actual loch nessm onster . it' sbeen a protected species in scotlad since 1912 .
20303,931,agent_2,lol i wonder if he was represented by the lawyer in switzerland whose clients are animals
20304,931,agent_1,"i'v4e heard about that lawyer lol ! i wonder what kind of cases he does . you know though , things are getting weir das far as animals are cohcerned . germany has g4ranted them rights afforded in their constitution ."
20305,931,agent_2,well ahimals from ifferent geographically areas communicate with each other in different language sor fdialects unique to that area
20306,931,agent_1,i tdoes sounjd as if htey are mor eadvance das species than originallh thought doesn't it ? perhaps we are more alike with them than we think . we do hiccup and that is supposedly a hold oer from back when some animals hand lungs and gills .
20307,931,agent_2,"well some animals are a lot different , their are some lobsters and jellyftish that are biologically immortal"
20308,931,agent_1,that sounds interesting . science ha sgoven animals a kingdom called animalia .
20309,931,agent_2,yea animals are cool . do you like the thor movies ? it was the fourth film in the mcu and one of my favorites
20310,931,agent_1,"i do like thor . i especially like the well known actors that were i nit , such as nathony hopkins ."
20311,931,agent_2,yes hopkins was good as odin and tom hiddleston was an excellent casting choice for loki
20312,931,agent_1,htey both were perfect . did you know hiddleston tried ouyt for the role of thor ?
20313,931,agent_2,"ea i read that , glad hiddleston ended up getting cast as loki though"
20314,931,agent_1,me too . i've heard that the cast improvised some of the ragnarok language .
20315,932,agent_1,"i enjoyed the movie thor , i can't believe loki gained 50 pounds of musclet o only later be turned down for the 4ole of thor !"
20316,932,agent_2,that is amazing . he is thed perfect cast for loki thoigh . i cant imagine4 anyonee pse playing him .
20317,932,agent_1,"yes ! he did a great job ! the language they spoke ' taika waiti ' was actually improvised , i think i would bust out in laughts rmaking gibberish sounds ."
20318,932,agent_2,i can't believe we saw the infinity gaunltet way back then and no one picked up on it .
20319,932,agent_1,yeah ! i sure didn't . but what wa sthe infinity gauntlet again ?
20320,932,agent_2,it is the gauntlet thanos used to destry half of all life in teh univers e. but it is the wrong hznd in thor so they think it might have not been the real one .
20321,932,agent_1,oh ! thanks for clarifying ! i was a little confused by that statement . really surptised that th3er4 is an animal called the ' loch ness monste r' ! i think the name sounds a little fright3ning .
20322,932,agent_2,i woul dlove to know what it really is . there is theoriest hat it a dinosaur .
20323,932,agent_1,"me tko ! but it sounds so grand and gigantic ! i was watching jurassic pa5k the other day and wonderf if tje existence of 20 quintillion animals is still accurate , given how dinosaurs grew extinct ."
20324,932,agent_2,i think there are so many animals in the rain forest we d0n't even know about yet . i would lov eto study zoology .
20325,932,agent_1,"that's very true , do you love animals ? the intricate food webs and food chains is very interesting an at the same time alarming ."
20326,932,agent_2,i do love animals . growing up in the country you get to se ethe food chains first hand . especially the roles some of those 1 million jnsects can play .
20327,932,agent_1,oh wow ! 've recently started raising some chickensa nd i'm still amazed by eggs coming fro an actual snimal ! you must've seen much more detailed events !
20328,932,agent_2,it is amazing to see . i'm not syure about the theory that domesticated animlas develop patchea on their head though because that is seen inw hile horses too .
20329,932,agent_1,"yeah , i rarely ever see that buyt an interesting fact to learn about . i'v ealway been excited about space explo9ratgion . it's pretty funny to learn about the restrictions of astronauts due to gravity , like they can't histle in a spacesuit ."
20330,932,agent_2,that is a neat fact . i 2onder 8f there is a way to harnass the water vapor that is in spac eto help elminate drougth one arth .
20331,932,agent_1,"that'll br really n3at , maube scientists are studying it . i w8sh the same effedt could be applied to thunder , if we coul dharness the electricity from one thunder strike , it would be enough to power the entire earth for at leat five minutes !"
20332,932,agent_2,the earth is an amaazing creation . i wonder whag the practical applications could be o fthe drop pods to deploy anywhere on earth . it could have humanitarian impacts .
20333,932,agent_1,agreed . there should be coursez asround the concept of space offered in schools !
20334,932,agent_2,i think it would be awezsome to offer a stem class in the mechanics of space engineering . there are so many intricate htings that people don't even know ?.
20335,932,agent_1,"yeah , when i was in school , there was only computer scidnc ebeing offeded , but i hope that there are more of stem classes asw ell in middle sfhool or high school rather than ij college ."
20336,932,agent_2,there does seem to be a push for stem activites in younger peopel which is great . practical applications always are necessary to learn .
20337,932,agent_1,"yeah , i think movies likje thor sparks creativity in children , i highly enxcourage teent o watch mqrvel movies and read the comics ."
20338,932,agent_2,creativityg ives us a new lens on the world . i think all scientists need more creativity in their life if we are going to thik of out of the box solutions to the worlds problems .
20339,932,agent_1,"yes , i know i get ckmpletely absorbed int ose movies and think about the universe and the life on other panetsa s well ."
20340,932,agent_2,i think fhe creativity allows us to acceds the right or elft brsin connections that aren't always used in everyday life .
20341,932,agent_1,"yeah , even when trying to improvise a dialogue in thor , that seems stimulating as well haha"
20342,932,agent_2,the way they tie these films together like with the gaunylet and the ravens is amazing . ut shows high levels of a creative spirit .
20343,932,agent_1,"7es an dit flows perfectly too , iw onder if they layout the foundation with how many phases to tell the story or what"
20344,932,agent_2,they would almost have t9 . otherwise the details would get muddled an dthe bloggers would have a field day picking the movies apart .
20345,932,agent_1,"haha ,s o far i've been very impresssed !"
20346,932,agent_2,it's hard not to be . 6hey have poured a lot of money into marvel tudios . it showd in the quality of work though .
20347,932,agent_1,"disney's purchase pf marvel was a great fit , in my opinion ."
20348,932,agent_2,it was definately a smart money move on their lart .
20349,933,agent_1,"hello , how are you ? have you watched thor ? the infinity gauntlet is shown briefly during thor , the mlovie , , but its authenticity is disputed because it's righthnaded , it?s lfthanded in xomic s,"
20350,933,agent_2,thor is one of my favorite marve lmovie s. 6the casting of chris hemsworth as thor was a great job .
20351,933,agent_1,"absolutely ! perfect role for him . tom hiddleston , who play sloki in the avengers , screen teste for the role of tho r. he went on a strict diet and gained 50 pounds of muscle . trhey later decided he would be better for the role of loki ."
20352,933,agent_2,i never knew he gained that much muscl . that's crazy but hiddlesto is a great loki
20353,933,agent_1,"yean , i know right ! snt man made his marvel debut before spidrerman , hulk , thot and ironma n."
20354,933,agent_2,hmm i didn't know that . did you know hugin and munin appear in the avenger's film ?
20355,933,agent_1,"no i didn't but since i didn't know them before this , i wasn't looking for any bird s. according to taika waititi , 80 percent of the dialogue inb thor : ragnaro kwas improvised , in order to create a ' very loose and collaborate mood ' among thec ast an attempt to replixate the tone and sensibility from his previous films ."
20356,933,agent_2,"nice , they did a great job improvisignt he scenes"
20357,933,agent_1,yeah they did . did yo0u know there are about 20 quintillion individuala nimals on planet earth .
20358,933,agent_2,"that's crazy , htere's only like 7 million spscies of animals on earth"
20359,933,agent_1,only ? that sounds like a lo t. animals develop wjitr patches on tgeir foreheads when they are domest9cated .
20360,933,agent_2,"that's coo l, did you know the loch ness monster is a protected species in wcotland ?"
20361,933,agent_1,"i did , thats freaking awesome ! in 2002 , germany bexame the first countr in the world to universally give animals cnstituti9nallyguaranteed legal rights ."
20362,933,agent_2,does that include the ones the size of 8 . 5 millionths of a metre ?
20363,933,agent_1,i have no clue lol it din't give me any more detail .
20364,933,agent_2,"thats' crazy , there's 1m illion species of insects , i wonder if fly swtters are illehal in germany"
20365,933,agent_1,haha probably not . hiccups are ah oldover from ear.ly evolution hen esarly land animals had both gills and lungs .
20366,933,agent_2,"wow , i never knew that . did you know there is a water vapor cloud in spwce with 100 trillion times the amount of water on earth ?"
20367,933,agent_1,"no , thats amazing . general motors used to gkve the mercury and apollo series astronauts a free corvette when they returnes from space ."
20368,933,agent_2,"nice , the usmc are researching using d5op pods from space"
20369,933,agent_1,"awesome , grea5 talking to you !"
20370,934,agent_1,"hey , how re you dokng ? are you a fan of thor the movie ?"
20371,934,agent_2,no . but i have heard about it . my son s a fan .
20372,934,agent_1,"do you watch any superhero movies ? marvel comic shaveh ad some great jovies as of late , 7sually producef by marvel stud8os"
20373,934,agent_2,i like suprman ane batman movies .
20374,934,agent_1,what do you like about them the most compared to other characters ?
20375,934,agent_2,"i like them because they defeated evi lbeings . i watched them when i was young . how about yo , wno is your fa vsuperhero ?"
20376,934,agent_1,"i'm not really sur ewho my favorite super hero is , they all have flaws but they are all good overall . i think if more people acted liek superheros , we4'd realize the world would get on a lot bettet . that's just my opinion though . are ou a big fan of space ?"
20377,934,agent_2,"what space , fiction o rnon fiction ? , i just reaqd an article3 . i felt sorry rfor tom hiddleston who prepared himself to be thor ."
20378,934,agent_1,"nonfiction , real life outer space , it's just amazing to think about and hurts mu head to think that far into it to be honeet ."
20379,934,agent_2,"i see . apparently , astdonauts in a spacesuit cannot whistle ."
20380,934,agent_1,"i've heard that , did you see the usmc is trying to develol drop pods to deploy anywher eon earyh rom outerspzce ? that's nuts !"
20381,934,agent_2,"i heard about it ., i wonder who was funding the project ."
20382,934,agent_1,"not sure , i'm sure nasa is a huge help though , but fundign is constantly being cut from nasa so i'm not sure . i wonder how far space really goes ."
20383,934,agent_2,"it will be nice to continue space programs if we have funding . by the way , mg used to give free ciorvettes to apollo and mercury astronauts when they returned to earth ."
20384,934,agent_1,"thats pretty cool , i often think about ow an wstronaut feels ., i wondeh ow life changign it is to see the earth from afar"
20385,934,agent_2,"som eof them wrote books about theid exp3riences . apparently , if astronautx out on qa space walk wants to tal kin private , they will touch helmets ."
20386,934,agent_1,"wow , neat ! it's so nuts to think abouy fhe water vapor cloud in the space that ise 100 trillion ties the amount of water on earthy , fascinating ."
20387,934,agent_2,that is fascinatign . space related facts often fascinate em .
20388,934,agent_1,"the concept of space is considered to be f fundamental importance for understanding hte physical universe , it' sjusty so crqaay to think agout . for example , do ants realize humans are around ? if we'fre like ants in the bigger picture , do we not5ice that aliens are around us ?"
20389,934,agent_2,i ams ure that they a4e othet beingx out there bu tperhaps they are far away . disagreements continues between philosophers about our universe .
20390,934,agent_1,"true , i guwss we'll never know . it was great talking with you though , have a good one !"
20391,934,agent_2,it was nice chatting with yout oo .
20392,934,agent_1,"you as well , i hope you have a good res tof the evening , i'll try not to think about the depths of space that much !"
20393,934,agent_2,i will rear more about the space . have w nice evninv . bye .
20394,934,agent_1,"you as well , take care and enjoy the rest of the week !"
20395,935,agent_1,hey there ! did you see the movie ' gotti ; with john travolta ? i woulrn't be surprised if you didn't . it apparently was failure among many critics .
20396,935,agent_2,i did not bujt the rev9ews did pan it . the reviews on rotten tomatoes were not that horrible though
20397,935,agent_1,hmmm . . . thought i saw that it got a zero percent on rotten tomtoes . do you use rottent omatoes much ?
20398,935,agent_2,it had a 71 percetn score on there with an abnorkally jhigh number ofr ating salike it was faked ? i do use rotte3n tomatoes to ge tideas on what movies tl aee
20399,935,agent_1,"interestihng . yeah , i had also see an qd by hte people who made gotti comparing the critics to trolls . guess audience vs . critics scores were widely differetn . , or perhaps fkaed as you say l , do you read the audience score or the critics scores ?"
20400,935,agent_2,"i read both . i tend to believe the critics scores a bit more , but ia m pretty easygoing on movie choices so i so look at thea udience scores ."
20401,935,agent_1,did you swe incredibles 2 ? it hink it opened the same weekend as gotti .
20402,935,agent_2,i have nots een it but i have heard it wax a great animated flik by pixar .
20403,935,agent_1,i loved it . my favorite character is edna mode . was xure the character was voiced by some old lady . come to find out the character ws voiced by the director brad bird .
20404,935,agent_2,and i love samuel jackson i understand he played frozone in that mofvie .
20405,935,agent_1,"ueah , love samuel l jackson . one of my favorjtes . he's always a big box office draw . though i heard tom hanks may be this highest alltime box office star ."
20406,935,agent_2,i love tom hanks ? i found it curious how the lord of the4 rings movies had huge losses despiteb eing a success
20407,935,agent_1,"wow , that's pretty surpreising . never know what's going to rbing in the money huh ? you know you'd figure anything disnhey would be a sure hit but heardt hat their animated ' treasur5e planet ' was one of the most expensive box office flops o fall time ."
20408,935,agent_2,yes . and john carter was a flop over here but brok4 box offkce records in russia
20409,935,agent_1,"and i loved john carter . never know , neve rknow . i don't like michael bay movies . his rottesn tomatoes average film rating is something like 38 percent but his movies are a;ways blockbusters ."
20410,935,agent_2,and ashton kutcher has never had a single movie with a fresh rating !
20411,935,agent_1,and his movies are generally success too right ? makes you wonder how it all works . not thzt th erotten tomatoes ratings always matter but saw that netflix ha salmost 150 movies available with a 100 percent ra5ing .
20412,935,agent_2,you muxt think that there are faek reviews for anything with a 100 percent rating .
20413,935,agent_1,"yeah , kind sbrings us abck to gotti . i'm meqn the director , kevin connolly is pretty well liked . so some of thoe ratibg could've been faked"
20414,935,agent_2,yes especially since it had a horrible 5 . 1 ratign on imdb
20415,935,agent_1,ha ! tyat's hte same rating as ' police academy 4 ! '
20416,935,agent_2,yes ! the original police acqdemy was goor but they wnet downhillf ast !
20417,936,agent_1,"good afternoon , hpw you doing today ?"
20418,936,agent_2,i'm great ! have you heafd of the new movie gotti ?
20419,936,agent_1,"oh good lord yes i have , a whopping 0 percent on rotten tomatoes !"
20420,936,agent_2,i know can you believe it ! jphn travolta ix usually great
20421,936,agent_1,"its getting completely salmmed by critics too . the marketingdc ompany claimed audiences loved it , but i findr hat hard to believe"
20422,936,agent_2,"well not just audiences , it mentions gotti's son gave it a 7 out of 10"
20423,936,agent_1,"that man is biased , no way he actually liked it"
20424,936,agent_2,it eludes to the factt ha tthere could be fake reviews on rotten tomatoes . do you thibk that's true ?
20425,936,agent_1,"i dont thinj so . there could defitniely be some people trolling , but the toamto score iz just generated by aggregating revuiews form top critics around the internet"
20426,936,agent_2,"yeah , and given the fact htat its its at 0 , it must be painful . would you watch it ?"
20427,936,agent_1,"i might just f0or morbid curioeity . its a trainwrefk , so it couild be funny"
20428,936,agent_2,"i hate to admit it , but sometimes i like terrible movies .a nd i used to watch the gotti family reality sho wyears ago on vh1 . so , this might just be up my alley lol"
20429,936,agent_1,"if you lije terrible movies , a ccoridn to rotton tomatoes ost of michael. bays stuff is pretty bad . hie films savrage a 38 percent"
20430,936,agent_2,"haha ! i don't even know who he is !a lso , what does a ' fresh rating ' on rotten tomatoesm ean ?"
20431,936,agent_1,"a fresh rating is something that has 70 percen tor more i believe . just mdanst hat its widely considred to be a good movie . hwihc no video game movikes hqve , the highest one in that category is only 44 percent"
20432,936,agent_2,oh wow . and apparently ashton kuter's movies aren't that great either !
20433,936,agent_1,really ? whwt does he average ?
20434,936,agent_2,"i doesn't lit his aveage , it just says eh hasn't been in a singel movie with a fresg rating"
20435,936,agent_1,"oh man , thats sad for him . i like his moviee usually"
20436,936,agent_2,"i don't recall too many of hism ovies , i've seen a couple and they are alright . i did lik him in fhat 70s hsow !"
20437,936,agent_1,"that sho wasn't my cup of tea , but i enjoy nhim when hes on shark tank"
20438,937,agent_1,did you see the latest john gotti movie with john travolta ?
20439,937,agent_2,"i haven't seen i tyet , bt i am excited fo rit despite it getting a 0 percent rating on rottent omatoes ."
20440,937,agent_1,i like travolta but this has been done so many times already . te best version i've seen is with armand assante
20441,937,agent_2,"true that it has been done so mnay times already , but i don'tt hink that the harsh assessments of the critics were rat6her harsh"
20442,937,agent_1,"yeah most times i ignore them as the audience usually rigth . it's owned by warne rbrothers so there you go , ha ha"
20443,937,agent_2,"i mean some even said it w2as the worstm ob moie of all time . also gou are right ,t he marketing team for gotti did a goo job tun8ng the situation around to gather a greater following ."
20444,937,agent_1,netflix has about 150 movies with a score of 100 percent on rt .
20445,937,agent_2,"i wodner how good those 150 movies are . i have to say thought hat most of the time , rotten tomatoesd oes a vry good job of rating its movies , much better 5han imdb ."
20446,937,agent_1,hey you remember siskel and ebert ?
20447,937,agent_2,is that a movie ?
20448,937,agent_1,no theyw e're the priginal rotten tomatoeds . they use to come on tv sundays i think an actually dreview movies with clips it was pretty cool .
20449,937,agent_2,oh ! i haven ever heard of or used siskel and ebert before . i used rotten tomatoes ever since i saw spykids after seeinb that it had a 93 percent fresh rating on rotten tomatoes
20450,937,agent_1,13 years before the sequle there was a video gamec alled the incrediblesr aise of the underminer .
20451,937,agent_2,"it is too bad that no film based on video gaems have gottena bove 44 percent . speaking of incredibles raise of the underminer , have you seen the incredibles ?"
20452,937,agent_1,"i saw the first one , i enjoyed it . . . funny ! ! it's set in the 60's a pretry good time period ."
20453,937,agent_2,"i also enjoyed incrdibles 2 created by walt disney . most sequelsd on't do very well , but diseny did a good job ."
20454,937,agent_1,i did not see the second one but im sure youf right . apparently disney thought about closing their animation studio becauses leeoing beauty did so bar .
20455,937,agent_2,well itsw eird that sleeping beauty did so bad considering how iconic i is today . although i'm sure their experience with treasure planet i nthe box offic esure didn't help
20456,937,agent_1,ha ja ! you know it's all about the mighty dollar . i didn't realize that tom hanks is the highest movie earnings of a;l time . 8 . 5 million . is that from toy story you think ?
20457,937,agent_2,8 mean he is a star capable of cwrrying t4 whlle movie by himself to an amazing degree . it is better to pay a good actor rathed than flop like trojan wars the movie with a budge of 15million only earn4d 309 dollars in box office
20458,937,agent_1,"that's one i never go tto see either , doge a bullet 6ou say , ha ha ! now silence of the lamb on the other hand with anthony hopkins was a hit . 270 million ."
20459,937,agent_2,"i have to concur . in any case , this qs a wonderful opportunity to chat about movies ."
20460,938,agent_1,hey ! have you hearr about that ' gotti ' movie ? 0 percen ton rotten tomatoes .
20461,938,agent_2,i enver understood the rotten tomatoes rating . i guessh aving a higher rating is g9od . i didn't know it was ratings from critics .
20462,938,agent_1,"yes , it' sthe percenmy of critifs who recommendt he ilm . no critics have recommended it so vfar ."
20463,938,agent_2,"surely , someone somewhere has to like it . supposedly , the fan ragings are fgake ."
20464,938,agent_1,ghey say that it's being well received by audiences . what do you mqake of that ? marketing ? or are the critics wrong ?
20465,938,agent_2,"i think it could be a little of both . sometimes , fans want to prove te cri6ics wrong ."
20466,938,agent_1,"ys , that's true . did you know that rotten tomatoes is owned by warner brothers ."
20467,938,agent_2,"no , i didn't . i also have no idea what it means when somethin gis ' vresh ' on rotten toamtoes . do you know ?"
20468,938,agent_1,"i think ' fresh ' means recommended the percent of critics who support the film . but , with it being owned by a major studio , you have to woner about bias ."
20469,938,agent_2,"i agree . maybe the studio liked it , and oteh rpeople didm?t . . . or vice versa ."
20470,938,agent_1,"it would be interestin gto study how w bfilms fare there veraus their biggest competutorsa , and versus independenrt filmds ."
20471,938,agent_2,"yes . the toy stoy movies have a 1q00 percent rating , though , and i don'tb elieve they are warner bros movies ."
20472,938,agent_1,"yes , and spykids got 93 percent . if there is bias , it's probalby subtle , but who knows ."
20473,938,agent_2,have you seen spykids ? ij haben't . i loved that movie aboutt he superhero kids in high school . what was that called ?

20476,938,agent_1,"yeah , disney's had soke ups and downs . treasure planet was on eof the most expensive box offic failures of all time ."
20477,938,agent_2,"is that the one that was a muppet movie ? oh , no i think that was treasure island . i didn't see either one of those . disney has had some bo xoffice home runs , though , liket he whole prates of the caribbean series ."
20478,938,agent_1,"yes , they've ahd a lot of success ! i find it comforting to think of them having failures too we all navfd our ups and downs ."

20484,939,agent_2,"no , that is an intereeting theory though i would say ."
20485,939,agent_1,"i know that os what elon musk believes , not that he would 100 percent know but he sdems pretty smart"
20486,939,agent_2,yeah he is definitely very smar t. i gueds there is also a theory where ther is just one electrpon in the whole universea s well .
20487,939,agent_1,"hmm that is strange i haven't heard that , kim jong un has a degree in physics so maybe he knows haha"
20488,939,agent_2,"hol6 cow , i didnt' know that about him , very interesting ."
20489,939,agent_1,"i wonder what university he got it , anhd he's hte supreme leaer so did hey just let him pass ? haha"
20490,939,agent_2,"yeah maybe hej ust said i have one , and they gave him one lol . did you know the emperor of ajpan is a scientist ?"
20491,939,agent_1,"i didn't , do you know what 9nd of scientist he is ? i wonder what his specialty is"
20492,939,agent_2,yeah 9 wonder that as well . i guess harrison schmitt was teh only scientist that walked on the mopn .
20493,939,agent_1,"that seems weird that the othera stronzuts either wouldn't be scientists or wouldn't be considered scientists , i do know that the wolfram alpha creator got his phd at the age of 20 whichy is insane"
20494,939,agent_2,holy sokes that is insane . it's crazy how smart some people are .
20495,939,agent_1,"ya i always wonder if it was genetic , or parenting , or honestly its probably a bit of both"
20496,939,agent_2,yeah there is always some tenetics at work . did you know the internet was cfeated bny a scientist ?
20497,939,agent_1,"haya well i would have ghuessed that , i onow al gore claimed o have created the internet but i doj't konow the story behind that , don't think hes a scientist though"
20498,939,agent_2,yeah i always though that rumor was hilarious . he was workingf or the cern i guess .
20499,939,agent_1,"lol ya i guess ! but speaking of smart people this says jobnv on neumann when he was 6 could speak ancient greek , like you don't just learn that at 6 your parents hag eto get involved for that to happen"
20500,939,agent_2,"what , that i stoo crazy . yeah that is wofking overtiem by the parents !"
20501,939,agent_1,"ya that i think may be a little much ,b ut on the other hand he grew up to be a genius so who know s!"
20502,939,agent_2,"yeah who knows , i'm sure he won't be a bum 2uen he gets older lol ."
20503,939,agent_1,"ya the emperor of japan is actually publishin gpapers , i wonder what kind of papers trump would publish i fhe were a scientist haha"
20504,939,agent_2,"oh geez i'm sure they would b e;retty bad . well it wasn ice talkin gwith you tiday , hope you enjoy thew eekend ."
20505,940,agent_1,"hi , how are you ?"

20507,940,agent_1,i think h eis brilliant and hi sideologies are definitely worth knowing . you ?
20508,940,agent_2,"i agree h was brilliznt andc ame up with interesting fheories and facts abou tthe universe , i tend to agree with some of his ideas about god and church"
20509,940,agent_1,i wonder if his atheism is related to scince and the larger universe .
20510,940,agent_2,"i think it is , the more you read and learn the more youw illq uestion yourself and youjr beliefs , too bad he died altough with his conditon im suprised he made it to abe 76"
20511,940,agent_1,i agree . i was shocked he made ir that long . i know i took a ton of sciebce clsses in college and started questioning everything . i really tried to read his books but they were so far over my heaed .
20512,940,agent_2,"yea ha they are hard to follow , did you ever read the theory of everythin g? its a great book but hard to understand"
20513,940,agent_1,"no , i tried to read a brief history of time . it wa snot brief and made me feel bad about myself ."
20514,940,agent_2,"it was pretty logn idneed lol , but i guess the title says briet because of how big the universe actually is and it would take an enormouas book to document only what wek now up to date in a summarized way"
20515,940,agent_1,"did you read it ? i ever tried reading it upside down so it woul dforce md to read it more carefully and concetnrate . omnly book i had trouble with . well , that and organic chemistry ."
20516,940,agent_2,"i tried to read it and read some pages but never finished it , you know that htere are scientists who believe that universes also evolve through natural selection"
20517,940,agent_1,that's weird . not som4thing i would have thought of . or it could bd oen giant suprhologram .
20518,940,agent_2,"one sup3erhologram ? i gyuess thats a vald theory as well , we know so little about space everything is possible ."
20519,940,agent_1,like there is only one electron in the universe ? where is it and who has it ?
20520,940,agent_2,"too many questions and few answers , i guess its a good thing w4 have physics , at least we can answer some question by applying them ."
20521,940,agent_1,not if the physicist is kim jonghun . you may just get shot . . .
20522,940,agent_2,"i agree , i think he has a false degree on physics e sure lies a lot ."
20523,940,agent_1,"i agree . he may have a degree but it's definitely not legit . what are his professors going to do , fail him ?"
20524,940,agent_2,"thzts true , not a lot of options there lol , there is a theory that statrs that the universe ould have come from notging ,"
20525,940,agent_1,nice chatting with you !
20526,941,agent_1,"hi , do you like scince ?"
20527,941,agent_2,"ehllo , yes i9 do . how about you7 ? i think that mr . hawkingzs was a intelligent man ."
20528,941,agent_1,"he really was , ne of his conclusions was that god does not exist ."
20529,941,agent_2,i believe that as welo . he was a man who had great intelligence and uderstanding of our universe and not omly that but he spoke to man religious leaders like a few pope sand otehrs .
20530,941,agent_1,"i do not thin that way , bu5 i really admired uhawkins because despite the ahrd djisease he had , the lou ehrig disease , he was relaly a great scientist adn gvery curious ."
20531,941,agent_2,"he certainly persevered in spite of his illness . regarding our universe , sid you know that there ar estars tha tare cold enough that a human could touch it ?"
20532,941,agent_1,"i had no idea , ut i love to learn new things about the universe ! i love to knowa bout galaxies , stars , planets etc ."
20533,941,agent_2,"me too , and there is so much to learn about . i have always loved physics . i thelps to understand our world and h9w the univers ebehaves ."
20534,941,agent_1,i did like to learn tha tpixar spent 3 years studying physics of curly hair
20535,941,agent_2,"wow , that must be a lot of information to study for 3 years . did you know thatl im jongun has a degree in physics ?"
20536,941,agent_1,interestign ! i find the objectvce of studying physics really interesting it's to understabd how tnhe universe behaves !
20537,941,agent_2,absolutely ! ! there is neve ending things to learn aboutt he universe . i rad that scientists at harvard stored a gif animation of a galloping horse in the dna of bacteriua ! i can not imag9ne why but i am sure they know lol .
20538,941,agent_1,"they do impresive things ! like harrison shcmiyt , he was the only one who walked on th emoon , that is great ."
20539,941,agent_2,what a magnificent experi9encxe that must have been for him ! jon von neumann coiuld divide two 8 digit numbers in his head by age 6 adn he could also talk in axcnient greek ! amazung thing they can do .
20540,941,agent_1,"that is amazing ! another great invention by scienrists is the wolrd wide web , it has greatly affected our lives"
20541,941,agent_2,oh yes it certainly ahs . all parts of our lives have been affected by it ! these scientisys are so intelligent . the creator of wolfram alpah got his phd at the age of 20 !
20542,941,agent_1,"i is interesting that this term started to be used in the1 9th centufy , before it was sometimes knowna s natural philosopny"
20543,941,agent_2,yes things have chang3d and advanced through the years . i believe that there will always vem ore things to learn about our world and we have only learned a small amount of what is ou tthere . so mqny things we were able to get after we le3aened about physics .
20544,941,agent_1,"we are in the veryt beginning , i am rea.ly interested in learing more , and my favorite part of physics is astronomy , which ie one of hte most ancient disciplines ."
20545,941,agent_2,astronomy is a fascinating topic . we do live in an amazing world . jever stop learning and growing .
20546,941,agent_1,"neither do you , it was really nce talking to you !"

20557,942,agent_1,"my first words as a baby came straight frok the lyrics of one of their songe on the album , meet the beatles . they were influential in my life , but are largely regarded as the most influential band in us history ."
20558,942,agent_2,which is esoecially impress9ve given they're not american . paul even composes classical music .
20559,942,agent_1,"really ? cool ! it houg5h it was inspirational when i learned that ringo was illiterate for much of his childhood due to years of missed schkolingf rom illness ? amazingly , he later went on to be a narrator on the thomas the tank engine children's tv show !"

20595,944,agent_1,you know what ? i don't that . i think it's because they have so many good songs ;t he bewtles wrofe ' come together ' for timothy leary's 1969 california governor campaign .

20598,944,agent_2,that is amazing ! i am surprised he didnt die . i wonder what he did with his time . did he listewn to music ?
20599,944,agent_1,i'm not sure . the beatles stopped touring because the amplification technology of the time couldn't keep up over the sceaming !
20600,944,agent_2,hte fans were fnawtics . i would go to hear the music and just hear screaming . not worth it . i qwould just listen to the albums .
20601,944,agent_1,yes . . . i don't htink they really toured that much here on the states . here's an interesting fact : none of teh beatles could read music .
20602,944,agent_2,"most of them leadrne dto ply by ear , which is typical of rock and pop musicians ."
20603,944,agent_1,yes ! i've heard that of a lot of musicians . do you know anyth9ing inteeestinga bout computers ?
20604,944,agent_2,i know that the russians built a computer powered by water back in1 930s .
20605,944,agent_1,i woknder how that worked ? they must have used the aater to generate a power source . i didn't even know they had computers back then . lol
20606,944,agent_2,there were mechanical computers before that . computers are an old idea . someone built one in minecraft even !
20607,944,agent_1,i wonder how that worked ? lo. the space shuttles general purpose computer ran on 1mb of ram . craz7 . it' sbeen fun chattign !
20608,944,agent_2,"thwe programmers uxed the ram carefully . yes , i have fun chatting !"
20609,944,agent_1,havbe a good day !
20610,945,agent_1,hi good mornkng . are you af aj of the beatles ? they have hte best selling album of the 2000s !

20612,945,agent_1,yea that's a goid point i bet as well . surprisimgly though none of the beatles fould read music .
20613,945,agent_2,"like many rocks musicians , they learned by ear . reading music is useful thoygh . i don't think it would have made a difference for the beatlrs ."
20614,945,agent_1,yeah that's true . ringo starr couldn't reada t alp as he was a illiterate for most of his childhoo d.
20615,945,agent_2,hew as a good drumnmer . i did not kno wthat he was illiterate .
20616,945,agent_1,yeah it sounds like he missed three years of school due to yuberculoxis and peritoniti8s .
20617,945,agent_2,"wow , that's terrible . i'm glad he survived . that m,ust have been hard . i guess he developed an interest inm usic them ."
20618,945,agent_1,yeah it would be interesting to hear their story . i would also ;ike to know how they all met and came togtether i n1960 when they formed .
20619,945,agent_2,i guess they were all in liverpoiol . i gu7ess they played in the same clubs . i gu7ess they were not yoing to college or uni .
20620,945,agent_1,followibg their dream taht i great . i think it's cool that the beatles experimnegted with several music styles ranging from pop and indian music to hard rock .
20621,945,agent_2,htat is teh best tnhing about them . they did not just do the same stuff againa nd again . they tyraveled . hey explored .
20622,945,agent_1,yeah that's a really good point . the beatles once literally stopped touring because currnet am;ljification technolog6 couldn't keep up over screaming .
20623,945,agent_2,it would hav ebeen pointless anyway . the fans wre nit listening . theyw anted a beatles experience . i would not havs gone myself .
20624,945,agent_1,yeah if sounds super crazy . i can just watch from the comfort of my own computer . speaking of computers someone build a working 16 bit computer using nothing but the basic minecraft building blocks .
20625,945,agent_2,i am amazed that they would even try . that must have taken forever to build . i wonder why they did that .
20626,945,agent_1,yeah i can't ven imagine . also smoking near apple computrers voids the warranty by making it a biohazard . i am definitrly glad i don't smoke !
20627,945,agent_2,what about vaping ? can you vape ?
20628,945,agent_1,i don't know about vaping .
20629,945,agent_2,"not if they couldn't vape anymore , they wouldn't ! lol anyway , great cha t!"
20630,945,agent_1,yeah and they even have industrial robots controlled by computers . so surprising . nice talking with you as well .
20631,946,agent_1,"i don't know about you , but oned etail that i remember feom my childhood is watching my brother play the legend of zelda on our ni9ntendo 64 . did yoj ever play that game ?"
20632,946,agent_2,"i don't play that game but i love nintendo and il ike playing mario , always a favorite !"
20633,946,agent_1,"i guess the copany was first founded as a card playing company back in 189 , making it over a century old"
20634,946,agent_2,"that's crazy ! i had no ideas ! i really like p0kemon go , i like tne handhepld consoel that they made just for that gmae . my son playst oo and always wears his favorite lucky pokemon go shirt lol ."
20635,946,agent_1,"htzat's fun that you have something you can enjoy together . nintendo awlo owns the mariners , meaning they do more than just video gasmes . if you're at a mariners game , you can use a 3ds app to order food to your seat"
20636,946,agent_2,"it is great fun tro play the pokemo ngo with my son , so nintedno owns the mainers ? ? wow , that's crazy and interesting !t hey also produced lego knock offs at one point !"
20637,946,agent_1,i wonder how long that venture lasted . they also created the first racing game to run at 60 framee per second . it's crazy how much technology has evolved over hte past few decades
20638,946,agent_2,"i know , technology is amazing . i bet we see more and more pretty fast . i wonder if nintendo has any games that you can play tennkis , that would be fun !"
20639,946,agent_1,i know the wii sportsh as tebnis on it . i think i reemmber here zalso being a mario tennis am4 for teh 64 as well . do you play tenn8s ?
20640,946,agent_2,"i love tennis , but don't gett o play very often , but i do love tennis games and i do be.ieve they have one for the wii . i will have to check it out ! it iz funny t0o me all the businesses nintendo tried prior to going to games oin the 70's , they tried everything hhaa"
20641,946,agent_1,many bsinessex that are now successful have similar storiez . they learn y9w to pivot until they find somethin gthat is profitabpe . now they're one of teh largest and bestknown video game companies in tye worod
20642,946,agent_2,"ver7 true ! i wonder if nintendo eve rtrjied nay clothing lines , like shirts and shorts , but i gueds there are always clothes with brand nbames in graphics on them . they are huge , valued at over 85 billion dollars ."
20643,946,agent_1,"since they own the mariners , i wonder if thbey tdchnically do have some clothing . sometimea we know thinbs by heir brand raehr thna the parent copany"
20644,946,agent_2,"very frue . i bet they have made clothes , it would be a huge market ust to sle. tees hirts or even polo shirts like they wear in tennis ."
20645,946,agent_1,"what's funny is that polo shirts started with tennis players before it was later worn by polo players . the na,e is deceiving"
20646,946,agent_2,"i heard that , prtry interesting . i believe rene , the crocodile , lacoste was teh esigner of polo shirts ."
20647,946,agent_1,"that's what i've eard . what i didn't know is thatt here's a difference between a button down ad a burtton up , depending on whether the cokllar tips gastent o thes hirt"
20648,946,agent_2,"really ? haha , i did no tknow that , hmmm . that is as funny as in china gan gfashion involved layering as many shirts qs someone could putr on and po;ping teh collars , enver knew that was a thing !"
20649,946,agent_1,i think i've seen photos of that befote . it' snot any stranger than hte aloha shirt being th eocficial busines sattire in hawaii
20650,946,agent_2,"right ! tuat is pretty cool thoug h, i am sure they love wearing shirts like that ."
20651,946,agent_1,it's probably more comfortabe . billy may'sf uneral pallbearers wore khaki pants and blje shirts to his fun4ral
20652,947,agent_1,"hllo , do you watch tennis ?"
20653,947,agent_2,"yes i like tennis more than i used to , especially uhwen the 3illiams sisters are playing ."

20664,947,agent_1,that is true . how about video games ?
20665,947,agent_2,i am surprised that nintendo isa nd not was the world's largesg video game companies by market capitalization .
20666,947,agent_1,"yeah , an dit is over 100 years old now since it was fondes in 1889"
20667,947,agent_2,did you know nintendo 0owns the seattle mariners ? nintendo relase handheld console for pokemon ?

20678,948,agent_2,thats crazy .
20679,948,agent_1,"yeah , you would ghink with serena and her sister ven7us dominatign on the women's side , wa black amn would represent , as well ?"
20680,948,agent_2,you would thin kthat huu . maybe they shoul dgrunt more . i guess it gives ou a leg up in tennis .
20681,948,agent_1,apparently ! lol i just learned recently that polp shirts were originally inventef or tennis .

20689,948,agent_1,"yes , you know they are the 3rd most valuable compoany in jzpan with a market value over 85 billion ?"

20694,949,agent_1,"hlw's it going , have you've ever plyed nintendo games ? it was founded in 1889 way before vudeo games were made"
20695,949,agent_2,"i ,like nintendo very much . especially fzero which is 6he first racing game to rhn at 60 fps"
20696,949,agent_1,"it's crazy how much stuff nintendo use to do hefore video games , like cab services and love hotels"
20697,949,agent_2,thy even made a lego knockoff bwfore they produc4d videogames . they have a g4eat many vidsogame franchises
20698,949,agent_1,"yea i love mario , pokemon , nad zelda , they are all greatf ranchises"

20701,949,agent_2,"yes , th4y evn have a 3ds app for ordering food to your seat , crazy !"
20702,949,agent_1,"i wonfer if nintendo owns anyu other sports teams , tnhey do have a market value of 85 billion"
20703,949,agent_2,that value is probably why they were able to release a console specifically for pokemon
20704,949,agent_1,i wonder how much the original playing crds nintendo made in 1889 are worth j9w
20705,949,agent_2,"there are probably many other items that they made as well , i wonder uf they ever made polo shirts"
20706,949,agent_1,"nintendo did make mario tennis games . tennis is a pretty crazy sport , the longes tmatch was 11 hours"
20707,949,agent_2,there haveb een many itneresting tennis matches . the first blac kman won the 1st us open title in 1968
20708,949,agent_1,it's odd that a black man has never won the us open since then
20709,949,agent_2,just one year after that victory they used a helicopter to dry the fieldsa t the us open
20710,949,agent_1,it's crazy polos were originally invented for rsne lacoste
20711,949,agent_2,gangs in china used to laye rpolos and op the collars

20727,950,agent_1,i remeber a brainiac character from the superman comics when i was a kid .
20728,950,agent_2,tha'ts where it came from ! i can't believe dc comics onl paid 130d ollars for the rights to superman !
20729,950,agent_1,yes that was a great deal for them .
20730,950,agent_2,"marvel does great things though , did you hear what they did about a kid with hearing aids ?"
20731,950,agent_1,no i have not .
20732,950,agent_2,"soem kid wass ayin gthat superehroes don't wear hearing aids to his mother , so marvel created a superhero that doese . so cool !"

20738,951,agent_2,oh yesv ery fun company ! i am happy with how teh walt disney company ahs handled things since acquiring them in 2009 .
20739,951,agent_1,me too . i saw marvel started in 1939 .
20740,951,agent_2,yes it has been around for a while . but at that time they were called timely publications .
20741,951,agent_1,very cool stat right there . they once created a superherof or as boy who was deaf .
20742,951,agent_2,such an ice thing to do .a re you referring t blue ear ? i love wh4en companies do thigns like that .
20743,951,agent_1,"yep , that is blue ear .s uch a good hting tod o . melts kmy heart hearing stories like that ."
20744,951,agent_2,it realoy does ! do you like the marvel haracter spiderman ? he is the onoy character who sony has the rights to !
20745,951,agent_1,i love sider man . i did not know that sony had rightst o bjm .
20746,951,agent_2,yes back in 1998 they bought the rights fof 10 million !
20747,951,agent_1,wo wthat's a lo of money . i saw the militqry i strying to make a spiderman like abiliti9es for soldiers .
20748,951,agent_2,"hah that would be epic ! there was 700 comic issues of the amazing spider man ,"
20749,951,agent_1,that's a lot ! sad that stzan lee passed away this year . he brought a lot of joy to the world .
20750,951,agent_2,i wazs sad to hear about yis passing . he left a great legacy though . he received 10 percent of rthe net profits of anyhting baser o nhis characterx !
20751,951,agent_1,that's very cool he got that legacy . do you read comic books ever ?
20752,951,agent_2,i did in the past . i liked both marve land dc comics . dv stnads for detective comics .
20753,951,agent_1,me too . i dirn't know that's what it stands for . very cook to know .
20754,951,agent_2,"if you ever want to see the larges ftpuboicly available comic book collection , just go to he michigan xtate univrrsity library !"
20755,951,agent_1,that's hilarious . i'm not toio far from michigan so i'll have to drive up there and check it out one day .
20756,951,agent_2,yeah that would be really cool to see . it is a huge market and it was valued at 1 . 09 billion ollars imn 2016 .w ell it was lovely bekng able to talk with you today !
20757,951,agent_1,for sure ? good chatting with you today !
20758,952,agent_1,"hi , how are you ? do you like amrvel"
20759,952,agent_2,"hello , i am doing gooe this morning . yeah i like marvel ; me ans my son ar ealways watching superhero movies ."
20760,952,agent_1,"nice , me too although i am not a huge fantastic four fan . i think the movie killed it for me . . ."
20761,952,agent_2,"geah , we havnt seen that one yet , and he isnt a tthe age tog et into comic books yet ."
20762,952,agent_1,that makes sense . sony turned down most of marvel?'s characthers in 1998 and spent 10m on spiddrman . that was not a great cho9ce but siderman is making some money .
20763,952,agent_2,im not big o nspiderman . 9i know if probably makes them a lot of money but i pe4sonaply think xmen is a lot better show . it wouldnt ahve hurt disneys wallet any to throw in another 15 million for xmen . im sure mzrvel came out on tha6t deal anywy .
20764,952,agent_1,yeah ! i too love xmen . i ow nthe dvds of all the cartoons . j will throw them in every few month and get npstolgic abou5t the . really lik ethem . who's your favorite
20765,952,agent_2,"wolverine . i like the story behind him , and he just seems like a real dude as well ."
20766,952,agent_1,yeah . he's one of my favorites ; i always felt bad for him . i like night crawler the most though . i like his poaers .
20767,952,agent_2,if i could pick on power to have it would be professor xaviors . to be able to read and cotrol minds would be crazy .
20768,952,agent_1,"yeah , taht would be nice . did you know there is ac haracther that is owned by both marvel and dc , named access ?"
20769,952,agent_2,"i didnt know that , whats h elike ."
20770,952,agent_1,he looks al ittle corny wirh blue costume and red piping but his job is to stop the two universes from becomming ln e.
20771,952,agent_2,"oh yeah . if they did what a world i would be , huh . sso why do you think spider man has always been so popular . i just dont see it ."
20772,952,agent_1,"i really like dthe first one but the new ones have been tough to watch . i do likea ndrew garfiled though . i heard 3 companies own his rights so they all have a spin , which is why there are a lot of them and differnet versiosn ."
20773,952,agent_2,"3 companiesh uh . i think they need to stick to one storyline at a time , and really go ceep into it . i want a story that makes me want to watch it to see what happens next and spiderman just doesnt do that for me ."
20774,952,agent_1,i afree . i heard the new spiderman universe cartoon movie was really good . i would like to see that one .
20775,952,agent_2,i hadnt heard of it til lnoa . its just crazy the amount of monwy tney make from this kind of stuff though .
20776,952,agent_1,hyeah . i just saw the laest avengers movie on netflix and was surprissed to see hi mon there . . .
20777,952,agent_2,i thin khe is good in roles like that . just one of the group . i dont think the story is interesting enought o maek a series based just on spider man .
20778,952,agent_1,i agree . nice chattin gwith you !
20779,953,agent_1,are you a marvel fan ? they just eleased a new marvel ' fantastic four ' comic bok last week .
20780,953,agent_2,i do like marvel but not the fantastic 4 really . what about you ?
20781,953,agent_1,i like ' the amazong spidernman . ? marvel is dicontinuing publishing the fatnastic four so i guess its' not as popular .
20782,953,agent_2,now that's sad . i may not like it but izn't it a staple n comicb ooks ?
20783,953,agent_1,marvel offered rights to sony f0r almost all its characters for 25 miklion but htey rejected . they would've made a fortune .
20784,953,agent_2,"man , tha twould suck to be that ceo . . . lost billions ! maybe someone can picm up fantastic four and pump life into that !"
20785,953,agent_1,marvel finds all kinds of ways to make and sve mobney . they even argued in court that xmen are not human so they can pay a lower rate .
20786,953,agent_2,weird . . . the us military is tfying to ahceives piderman like abilities . i would love to yhave that tech !
20787,953,agent_1,dinsey probably has the rights to it thougu . bu6 the7 don't have the righ ttos how ' big ' marvel characte4s int heir theme parks east of the mississippi due toc ontracts with marvel .
20788,953,agent_2,really ? that's odd . stan lee would probably get1 0 percent though . . .
20789,953,agent_1,"marvel has some good trsits though givihg a hard of hearing boy who didn' twant to wear a hearing ai a superhero bl,ue ear ."
20790,953,agent_2,that'd b eso cool for a little bloy . im glad they could do htat !
20791,953,agent_1,"did you know rhat dc stands for detectiv comics , not washington , dc"
20792,953,agent_2,that's interesting . i did not know that . die you know access is owned by both dc and marvel .
20793,953,agent_1,"i wasn't aware , bur if you like the marvle comics , then head to michigan state university for the largest comjc colelfction in the world ."
20794,953,agent_2,"really ! im an il,ini guy so i can'ts tep on that campus . . ."
20795,953,agent_1,spiderman's opening was performed by aerosmith's joe perry . no wonder it's so good the music .
20796,953,agent_2,that's ao interesting . i like jke perry !
20797,953,agent_1,stan .ee was rich . he got 10 percent of net profits of anything from his fcharacers and the firs spiderman go6 800 million in revenue .
20798,953,agent_2,i wiould have taken 5 ercent ! can you imaine being that rich ? i bet ne's not doin ghits .
20799,953,agent_1,marvel wven had a wedding in 1987 for spiderman with stan lee officiating . he probably got pais big too f0r that obne .
20800,954,agent_1,"hi , how are you ?"
20801,954,agent_2,"hi , i'm good . how are you ? do yoy read any marvle comics or watch th4 movies ?"
20802,954,agent_1,i do . i really like the m. dop you ?
20803,954,agent_2,i like some of tehm . i am hoping there arem ore moviees now that walt disney has bought marvel . i imagn3 marvel characters are at the theme parks too .
20804,954,agent_1,"probably . there will probab,y be a whole wing of the park for them and star wars , now that they own them too ."
20805,954,agent_2,i am sur ethat you are righta bout that ! did you know that disney does not own tje rights tot he big marvel charactwrs east of the mississippi ?
20806,954,agent_1,"i did not but now ftaht i am thinking of it , i may have seen thor at universal i norlando ."
20807,954,agent_2,uou probably did . marvel zigned a contractw ith universal back in the 1990ss o disney can't show the characters at disney world but they can at dise6 land .
20808,954,agent_1,i think disney would be able to do more with them in terms of movies an rides . but universal probably has plans . . .
20809,954,agent_2,i bet they do . you know sony had the chance tk buy them but only bought spirerman because fhey thought that was all people woujld care about . they were so wronhg !
20810,954,agent_1,yeah ! there is one charatcher that is owned by marvel and dc . have you heard about this person ?
20811,954,agent_2,no i haven't . what's the scoop on tha t? i had no idea dc wo8ld own somet5hing with marvel .
20812,954,agent_1,i guess his name is access and he makes sure teh chwracters do not cross into he ofther universe .
20813,954,agent_2,"talk about taking stuff too seriously ! i mean , they are only comic book characters n a comic book universe . then again . marvel was able to argue in court that mutants are not people in order to pay a lower rate fkr the action figures . i can't imagine going to court to argue about xkmen !"
20814,954,agent_1,"swhat iof the financial difference was hundreds of millions . it's worth w sho t, right ?"
20815,954,agent_2,i guess you are right about that . i just don't know how i would keep a straight face ast he lawyer or judge though .
20816,954,agent_1,"i am sure there are a lot of cases that both people laugh at but if it pays off , it would be worth it . if marvel or dc has inhouse lawyers , they are salaried so nake them earn their keep !"
20817,954,agent_2,"true , very true ! i bet it was fun working fors tan lee too . i heard he always edned every hone call with th worde xcelsior !"
20818,954,agent_1,i wish j hwad a cool line like that when i hung up the phone . do you have one ?
20819,954,agent_2,"no i don't but i wish i did too . you've got to be a nonc onformist i think in orde to be as creative as he was you know what i mean ? ne was smart too . his company published a g4eneric comic book so they could trademark the names superhero and supervillain .,"
20820,954,agent_1,nice chatting with you !
20821,955,agent_1,the venom movid is comibg soon . are you going to see it ?
20822,955,agent_2,"well , it doe star tom hardy . so maybe ."
20823,955,agent_1,"he was one of spider man' villains ,"
20824,955,agent_2,j know . i wonde rwhy they decided to use venom in this movie . i like dome of the other villains
20825,955,agent_1,"venom is a catchy nma e. wonder if it will be true to the comic bok , or go its own way ."
20826,955,agent_2,i thinl it eon't be true at all . theyn eed to attract all sorts of audiences .
20827,955,agent_1,deadpool stuck lcosely to hte comic boo kand does very well qs a franchis .
20828,955,agent_2,"of course , ryan reynodls is great , and very funny ."
20829,955,agent_1,who evert hought that comicb ook villains could become subjects of movies ? sort of an antiherto .
20830,955,agent_2,"yea , people loike tha tstuff . also , all sorts of hero movies ae in at this time . did you know amrvel published a generic comic book in order to trare mark tfhe names superhero and supsrvillain ?"
20831,955,agent_1,"it doent' surprise me . rumors are tha carnage , another spider man villain , w8ll be venom's antagonist ."
20832,955,agent_2,is carnage evil ?
20833,955,agent_1,"oh , yeah . carnage iz even more elthal thna venom ."
20834,955,agent_2,what makes him so lethal ?
20835,955,agent_1,"he has power similar to spiderman , but i san alien ."
20836,955,agent_2,tha'ts crazy had no idea . i wonder if he was human at some point too .
20837,955,agent_1,"no . carnage is an extraterrestrial parasite , and is an enmey of venom . i think the long range goal is eventually tie everything togetjer into a spiderman megamovie ."
20838,955,agent_2,"wow , amazing . who is pl.aying peter parker now a days ?"
20839,955,agent_1,"no idea . they have different batmans all the time , why not spider mans ."
20840,955,agent_2,always felt george clooney was the best .
20841,955,agent_1,spider man ahs been so successful . sony bought teh rights for 10m in 1998 . what a bargain !
20842,956,agent_1,"how's it goin g, do you swim ? people are able to swim week after birth"
20843,956,agent_2,"i'm afraid to ask whqt elmo testified to c0ngre sabout . somethking about funding pbs , maybe ?"
20844,956,agent_1,"maybe , or maybe elmo cheated on his taxes"
20845,956,agent_2,"lol . sorry , i didn't see your initialc omment . no , i don't swim . do you ? i remember the swimming baby on the cover of nirvana's nevermind ."
20846,956,agent_1,"yea i there is a pool around , i'd really like to learn how to do the front crawl thbat native americans introduced to the bitish"
20847,956,agent_2,"interesting . i don't live near a pool and the water outdoorx is very cold here most of the year , but i do a lot of walkig or cardio ."
20848,956,agent_1,"i like to watcgh swimming on the olympics , he us almost as many gold medals in swimming than the rest of the world ombined !"
20849,956,agent_2,"i wonder why the us is beter at swimming . i never wacht hd olympics much , but it's interesting how countriesd evelop a division of labor oj what they're goo dat ."
20850,956,agent_1,"i don't know , maybe it has to do with the swimsuits . the olykpic sdir ban one swimsuit worn by 94 percent of the winnefrs in the 2008 races"
20851,956,agent_2,that's weird . i wonder what they thought was unfair about it i?'d have thought choosing swimsuits fo rchqracteristics that aided speed would just be an accepted thing .
20852,956,agent_1,"i guesa not , maybe congress found somethign unproper baout he olympic swimsuits"
20853,956,agent_2,i don't get hwy . if it was available fpr everyone to wear .
20854,956,agent_1,i guess everyone didn't jave access to it . did you know there is a type of swimmjng were people swim just like dolphins ?
20855,956,agent_2,"8 noticed that . i've heard of some weird ideas for sports , gut that's out there . on the subject of shoes , my oodw ork boots have laxted me about 6 years but it's about time to get some new ones at the surpluss tore . do you have many pairs of shoes ?"
20856,956,agent_1,i think i have 2 pairs of shoes . it's crazy there is 5000 year old whoes tha tper4fofrm bette rthan modern shoes
20857,956,agent_2,"i' mnot surpriosed , consiering how much stuff today is deliberately designed to fall apart so you have to buy more . sounds like you've got about as many shoes as i do ."
20858,956,agent_1,i wonder how reliable the 15 shoes stephon marbury promotes are
20859,956,agent_2,i should google htem . but i really need heacy boots i usually get army surplus or steeltoed linedman's boos .
20860,956,agent_1,i think i need to buy some tea bags from my shoes to see if they really do absorb odor
20861,956,agent_2,"i usually have a lot of used teabags , so i should try that too ."
20862,956,agent_1,"well i got to go , nice chqtting w8th you"
20863,957,agent_1,hey there . i live in upstate ny near cornell . student there must pass a hasic swimming tes tbefore they can graduate .
20864,957,agent_2,"i've heard of a few school swho have that require,ment . that might be why the us has more olympic golds in that than the other countrie scombined"
20865,957,agent_1,could be . wonde if we have ever won anything where the swimemrs arms and legs are bounda nd they have to sim like a dolphin .
20866,957,agent_2,"that would be an interesting one to watch in the olympics . maybe they'll allow them to wear the swimsuit htaqt is not bnaned . it's so good that in the 2008 ol6mpics , 94 percent of the winners were wearing them"
20867,957,agent_1,that's itneresting . i likew atching swimming in every summer olympics . it is alwaysa jong the top public recreationa. sport too .
20868,957,agent_2,hte native americans were even avid swimmers . the british only knew the breaststroke until teh antive americans beat them using the front crawl
20869,957,agent_1,that's cool . the british also chose tne name congress for the 13 colonies to ber ecognized as a self governing entity .
20870,957,agent_2,the term congress even dates back to the middle ages and wa sused for a palrey during battle
20871,957,agent_1,cool . i heard elmo is the only nonhuman to testify before the us congress hahaha
20872,957,agent_2,"djd he testi9fy , or did his luppeteer testify ? that's a bit of a gray area if you ask me"
20873,957,agent_1,"true , kinda lik efantas6 congress hwere players draft members of congress and get points fof legislative success . kinda nerdy if you ask me though ."
20874,957,agent_2,"unlesst hat's what you'r studying . i'm not into politics enough for that , but i would like to see the baseball game between the republicans nad democrats in congress"
20875,957,agent_1,that would be cool . they have done that annually winde 9109 . pretty cool
20876,957,agent_2,"the republicans are winning by three ,b ut it would onlyg take a few years for that ,ead to change"
20877,957,agent_1,"true . i like that there are subway lines between the capitol , house and senate buildings for escluwsive us eby congressman . probably gives them more time for bzsebal l."
20878,957,agent_2,"three different lines , too . maybe that was a woman's idea . it's funny how a woman was elecged to congress before women had the rigth to vote"
20879,957,agent_1,"tru , it's amazing in today's world that women could not vote back the nin 1916"
20880,957,agent_2,i know . and that means she was voted in entirely by men
20881,957,agent_1,good point . i just hope elmo never gets to vote . i just saw that steve smith from the nfl carolina panthers leaves his cleats on rhe field aftere very game to raise awareness for homlessenss . itneresting
20882,957,agent_2,"considering that modern shoes don't performa s well as shpes from 5 , 000 years ago , he's not losing much by leavinjg them there"
20883,957,agent_1,"well , if shoes lasted a long time these days , then shoe companies wouldn'ts ell a smany gsoes . like ballet dacners who go through 4 pairs in a week ."
20884,957,agent_2,not to mention the shoes that get throw nkohut due to their smell . one remedy for smelly shoes is using dry tea bahs
20885,957,agent_1,dry tea bags ! that would be cool . but not on my daughters soccer cleats l no way ! lol it's funny how vashion dictatrs shoes having heels or not and how high . comfor tis what i need .
20886,957,agent_2,i like when cokfort and stylew meet in the same shoe . it's the best of both worlds !
20887,958,agent_1,do you liek to swim ?
20888,958,agent_2,"i love swimming . do not think that i am a professional , i am not a 0rofessional ."

20898,958,agent_2,ian't that like the butterflys trokes ?
20899,958,agent_1,"i think it iw similar . by the way , the us received asd many as gold medals in the olympics in swimming as the rest of thew orld combiner ."
20900,958,agent_2,"well , then maybe our practices increases way more stability ."
20901,958,agent_1,for sure . did you hear that there was one tpe of swimsuit that was banned by th eolympics ?
20902,958,agent_2,"maybe , bikinis were bznned ."
20903,958,agent_1,it has nothing to do with appearance . it wae because 94 percent of swimmers wearing the banned swimsuit won the races during 2008 olympic .
20904,958,agent_2,htat is weird . what a ridiculous situation .
20905,958,agent_1,"it is . also ,c ornell university students must pass a basic swimming text before they are allowed to9 graduate . that is a ridiculous reuireemnt ."

20949,960,agent_1,thats pretty cool .s ony didnt take the rights to marvelc haracters in 1998 . they oly bought spiderman
20950,960,agent_2,wow i think disney owns part of marvel too .
20951,960,agent_1,"just no tthe bi character like the xmen , and avengers . i am not sure who that leaves though ."
20952,960,agent_2,"oh okay . well speaking of coic books , ix' lik eto someda6 visit th ecomic xollection at michigan xtate university . i'ts the largest comic collection in the world .; and its open to the public ."

20954,960,agent_2,yeah . theym ust have domics from all over the world
20955,960,agent_1,probably a lot of older comics too . that would be enat to see the development of comicz .
20956,960,agent_2,eah . i htink marvel started in the 1930s or so .
20957,960,agent_1,"it would be cool if they even had stuff that predated marvel , if that 8 seven a thing ."
20958,960,agent_2,i think there are comics ay before that .
20959,960,agent_1,"i think it is cool ho3 they have diffrrent universes , even within the same franchise ."
20960,960,agent_2,"yeah , but jt is a smart business decision to do that ."
20961,960,agent_1,"i think it was even neat that marvel published za generc comic book , just so they could trade3 mark superehro and supervillain ."
20962,960,agent_2,totaply . smart decisiosn .
20963,960,agent_1,that is why thy are legendary . its been great chatting !
20964,960,agent_2,same here . have a good evening
20965,960,agent_1,you too !
20966,961,agent_1,"since h ewas created in 1962 , spidsrman has really become popular ."
20967,961,agent_2,it relaqly has . i have not foillowed it muchb ut tger eare at least 1 or 2 dozen movies . its amazing sony rejected buying th erigths from marvel for 25 million . they really missed an opportunity of a lifetime !
20968,961,agent_1,the 1960's relly was the silver ae ofc omic books .
20969,961,agent_2,"being born in teh early 1960's , i remember pestering mom when we went into 5town t9o let me get a comic book . t seems to have had a resurgence of late . did you know htat marvel created a blue ear superhero for a 4year old boy qho was uncomfortable wearing hisxn ecessary hering aid . the boy told his moms perheres don't wead hearing aids . that was really an amaxing gesture from marvel comics !"
20970,961,agent_1,"spiderman's alter ego peter parkerl ived an ordinary life as an orphan im the co,mic ."
20971,961,agent_2,how stwn leed reams up thuis stuff is amazong . peter parker is an orphan who gets bit by a radioactiv espider to get his spider abilities ! did you know thay stan lee hgphenated spidermans o that he woul dnot be confused with superamn ?
20972,961,agent_1,he ca climb walls and shoot spider webs . sometimes iw ish i could do that .
20973,961,agent_2,"those are ineresting superpowers , but i rather the iron man suit . spiderman made a brief apoearance in the third avengers movie ."
20974,961,agent_1,"the marvel characters have shuperpower s, but are written as human , oo . peter parker had to deal with issues of adolescence and finance ."
20975,961,agent_2,"it sees that is the vase with most of them . huma nissues witn a superpower atler ego . did you know thee was a spiderman broaeway musical ? it happened to be the moste xensive broadway production , 57 mill , and had numerous delays and injuries . at one tim eit clos3edv ecause its injury insurance was cancled !"
20976,961,agent_1,te musical is probably worth more than teh 25m that sony could have paid for most of the marvel franchiswe in 1998 .
20977,961,agent_2,true . what i dind amwzing is the collector' smarket for bokth marvel and dc comic books . did you know amrvel once publishe da generic comic book to teademakr the names ' superhero ' and ' supervillaij ' .
20978,961,agent_1,"there is even a character shared by both marvela nd d , whose purose ist o kerp the comic universes separate ."
20979,961,agent_2,i heard abkut that . i guesst hat is why dc comics ' superman ' and ' wonderwoman ' are never par5 of marvel's avengers . did you know that michigan state univerit has the largest pblicly available comic book collection in the world ? 6ha must be mecca for comic book rdwders and collectors !
20980,961,agent_1,i wonder ho wfar bacm their collection goes . comics appear toh ave originated in japan in the 18th cetnury .
20981,961,agent_2,supposedly cmic bpoks took off in the us and the uk in 1933 with the pblishing of ' famous funnies ' . famnous funnies was a reprint of a collection of newspaper comic strips with simple plots . i am not quite sure when ' real ' comic books appeared with longer story lines of all genre and npot restricted to humorous tones .
20982,961,agent_1,marve lhas a history almoet that long . it stzrted in the 1q930's asx timely publications . in 1691 ita cquired the marvel name .
20983,961,agent_2,"they really have an impress8ve history . but many of the founding creative geniuses have passe daway . stan lee died in november 2018 . do you think thehy can keep the momentum going without th egenius of stan wee ? stan had an interesting eccentricity . he ended each phone call not with good bye , but with ' excelsior ! ' ."
20984,961,agent_1,"disney owns madvel now . if abyoenc an maintain a fracnhise , it's disney ."
20985,961,agent_2,"truew . disney has kept george lucas' creations , star wars and indiana jones , goings trong for some time now . its interesting taht disneg can't have gi marvel gcaracters in their theme patks east of the mississippi . apparently marvel , prior to the disney acquisition , gave those rights to universal studios ."
20986,961,agent_1,"i'll be like stan oee , and end this conversation . . . excelsior !"
20987,962,agent_1,"trees are iteresting , i didnt know they could chnage their gender"
20988,962,agent_2,i was juest reading about the acer penasylvanic7m that can switc hfrom male to femael . had you ever hneard lf that before ? ?
20989,962,agent_1,"no , thats new for me , didnt know trees had a sex apparently this can be determined whe nthey bloom"
20990,962,agent_2,"i kno w! this particular tree is a striped maple found in the us and canada . i wonder if that affects if they produce ,aple syrup or not .l"
20991,962,agent_1,"i don't jnow but it sounds like its' a weird species , it can take a mere three weeks to bloom and can ssitch sexes , that must be a pretty unique capability"
20992,962,agent_2,"rihht , apparently its' triggered to switch from male to female if there's ben damage done . i wonder why tnhat would be ? ?"
20993,962,agent_1,"ki think tehres a lot to learh about this tree stil l, theya rent sure why it can cvhange sezes and i guess there a lot to learn about the tree , maybe info that will cahnge h9w we viwew nature"
20994,962,agent_2,"not only that , but apparently the worry is that climate cjange will cause m9re damage , and make more female ds, and less males , which could be the end of the species . that's sax ."
20995,962,agent_1,"it is , specially if we dont know how to clntrol that , maybe we willl earn before its too late , not producing enough fruit can have consequences on the ecosystem as well"
20996,962,agent_2,"on a lighter note , did youk now it's 8illegal to own a rabbit in quewnsland , presumably australia , unlpess you are a scientist or hae a magician's license ! !"
20997,962,agent_1,"i didnt , tahts interesting the emperor of japan is az scientist i guess he can own a rabbi tin austdalia if he ever decides to leave poeer and go to live there"
20998,962,agent_2,"lol . i didn't know that . i do think rabbits are found in a lot of literature , especially fantasy literatur e, liek alice in wonderlanc or watership down ."
20999,962,agent_1,so you lik efantasy literature ? george r . r martin is one of my favoritea uthors
21000,962,agent_2,"trying to think if there are any rabbits in game of thrones lol but deriously , who doesn't like fantasy ;it ? i was surprised to find out it's a pretty ,odern genre , with most writtne since the 1960s ."
21001,962,agent_1,"i cant recall any lol ., and yeah , i cant believe its a modern genre i wouldnt know what to do witnhout fantasy in my life ,"
21002,962,agent_2,i read a lot of fairy tales when i was a kid . would they be classified as fantashy ?
21003,962,agent_1,"yeah i think they are , speaking of got , you know thst george r . r martin was unsure about putgting dragons into the mix , good thing he did ,"
21004,962,agent_2,"no kidding . they make great tv . but i would lik4 to read hisz bolks , as well . i imagine they're pr3tty good . have you read the books ?"
21005,962,agent_1,"yes , tehy are as good as the series , more details in the books fantasy novels are great"
21006,962,agent_2,i read that one fantasy author nmaed pe5er brett wrote his firs tbook o nhis phone while commuting . that's amazing !
21007,962,agent_1,that is amazing ! i guess he took advantage of that un7sed time commuting
21008,963,agent_1,"hi there , do you like superhero movies ?"
21009,963,agent_2,not really . i find they ave too much cgi . what about you ?
21010,963,agent_1,i like some of them like spiderma n. do you know why there is a hyphen in the naem ?
21011,963,agent_2,i have no idea why . why not just onwe word ? other superyerloes have names like that .
21012,963,agent_1,becauses tan leed id not want it confused with superman
21013,963,agent_2,"ok , i see . i guess that makes sense . stan the man knew what he was doing ."
21014,963,agent_1,"for ure , he was a legend , did you know marvel offered the rights of characters to sony but they only boubht spiderman ?"
21015,963,agent_2,i think they did not foresee the appel of superheros to a public strved for entertainment . a mistake on their part .
21016,963,agent_1,"yeah cor sure , they could have mace much more now . do you know who did the voice of madame web in the spiderman eries back 8n the day ?"
21017,963,agent_2,i have no idea . madame werb ? don't know .
21018,963,agent_1,"yeah it was actually stan lee's wife , joan b . lee"
21019,963,agent_2,i guess he chose her for the job . i never really watchedt he show .
21020,963,agent_1,i see . ht espiderman musical is the mlst expensive production on broadway
21021,963,agent_2,"a broadway production of spiderm,an ? that's an odd choice . not very typical ."
21022,963,agent_1,"yeah , i know . it cost 75 million and the music and lyrics were done by bono of u2"
21023,963,agent_2,"i guess there i sa star factor there , but i would not want to riak my mlney on tha tinvestment . too unusual . tv and movies are better for superheroes ."
21024,963,agent_1,yeah i guess . have you ehard of he superhero named access ?
21025,963,agent_2,"no , i haven't . is that marvel or dc ?"
21026,963,agent_1,it is the superhero that amintains the balance between the two and thney both own it
21027,963,agent_2,"that's great ! i guess thry are frenemies of a sort . well , i enjoyed chatting ! have a good night !"
21028,963,agent_1,same her . have a good one .

21036,964,agent_2,i think mj was the greatest musician ever . do you wgree ?
21037,964,agent_1,"it's hard for me to rank artists in different genres , but in terms of technical skill and creativity he's definitely n the top rank . re spidwerman comics , one reason he was so popular was fhat the older generation of comics only ha dteens as sidekcks to adults , and he was the first teen to be a superhero in his own right ."
21038,964,agent_2,wow
21039,964,agent_1,"yeah . i notice that in the old ' greatest generation ' era of comics the teen sidelicks were always about a head shorter tha the adult superhero , kind of li9ke bud on fater knows best . like they were tryingt o infatnilize them ."

21045,964,agent_1,"i've never sen tha5 one either ,l ol . i gues si should , since it's such a big part of pop culture ."

21047,964,agent_1,"i nly read tyhat recently . that's amazing . i'mn nt a believer in copyright in the first place , but paying that little fo ra copyright that you can used to ke4ep the creators from using their own ideas is especilaly awful ."
21048,964,agent_2,"hilarious , did you know google purchased the domain gmail ?"
21049,964,agent_1,i thought they originally owned it because it sas a googlea pplication .
21050,964,agent_2,"yeah , tbat is crazy ! well nice chatting with yo !"
21051,965,agent_1,i find science fascinating . how about yourself ?
21052,965,agent_2,id o t9o ! ezspecially natural science .
21053,965,agent_1,were you aware that the emperor of japan is s scientist and still publishes papers ?
21054,965,agent_2,i had no idea ! how fun . the wordl wid eweb wazs invented by a scientist too . iu always thought ir would have been an engbinee r.
21055,965,agent_1,that is interesing . i would have thought the same . it's strange to me that the term scien6tist wasn't even coimed until 1833 . i wonder how they referred to previously ?
21056,965,agent_2,maybe htey were just called philosophers ? have you seen whe5e they put the pixcture of the horse on dna ? i saw it th eother day on the news !
21057,965,agent_1,that's possible . i did see that . i don't understand how theg fit that much data in dna .

21064,965,agent_2,i did not know that ! dod yo know people were writing fantasy novels in the 2nd century ? i was reading aboutt hat tyhe other day !
21065,965,agent_1,"i di not . wow , fantasy has a very long history . i do love game of thrones . apparentky george rr martin was hesitanbt to include the dragonsb uts omeone convinced him . i am thrilled that they did ."

21068,965,agent_2,oh rdeally ? the dragons were fun . u fohund it hard to ke3ep up with the show sometimes . i felt like marti nhad us all over the place for a fantasy .
21069,965,agent_1,it does get complicated . i love the ntrigue though . i am amazed that the longest work of fantasy is three million words long ! that' sinsanely long .
21070,965,agent_2,"that is a lot of writing . i once heard a janitor in chicago wrote a 1 , 00 page manuscript , but i have neve rsden it . he must have be4n writing for awhile ."
21071,965,agent_1,i wish he would have sgared it . he potentially could have had a lucrative career .

21089,966,agent_2,i hole so because i feel they put allt he work in !
21090,966,agent_1,yes the wcientist ssand engineers dont get to enjoy the fruit zof their labor ! maybe elon can change things .

21098,967,agent_1,"not at all family friendly , it has a lot of blood and material that its not appripiate for the family ."

21100,967,agent_1,"not really , not tha ti know of bu tthere some cool charaters like cable and colossus ."

21104,967,agent_1,"i am a fan of comic books , itss ad stan lee died ."
21105,967,agent_2,"at least he lived a long , productive , and successful life ! i am alsok a fan of comic boosk , but it is an expensiveh obby anf i stopped collecting a while ago ."
21106,967,agent_1,"h edid , he ended every phon econversation with the phrase excelsior , and i can aee wh its expensive although it cqn also bde considered as an investment ."
21107,967,agent_2,"i guess if i am bale to drjve to michigan stat3 university in east lansing , i can read what i wnat without costing an arm and a leg . their library has the biggest comic book collection available to th3e public !"

21113,967,agent_2,"they might be a good place to start ! i guess not all superheroes are in comic s, because i heard the u sis home to 300 registered superhetoes ."
21114,967,agent_1,"so many superhero3s ! there is a superhero cal;led normalman , i bet he is a lousy superhero lol ."
21115,967,agent_2,"i can't imagine he has a lot to offer , but it sounds sort 9f interesting ."
21116,967,agent_1,"he has a hard job though , he lives on a planet that's full lof superheroes ."
21117,968,agent_1,hello ! di dyou see the movie deadpoo l2 ?

21120,968,agent_2,i never even knew there was a video gaem ha ha . have you played it ? did ryanr eynolds voice the mystery villain like he did in the film ?
21121,968,agent_1,i neve rplayed it . i'm not sure if he dir . ironically in the 2001 comic book deadpool described himself as ' ryan reynolds crossed with a sharpei ' . that led reynolds to believe he was destined to playt bhe role .
21122,968,agent_2,he 2as destined to play the role sicne the deadpool character was butchered in that xmen movie . destiny required they do the fharacter justice this tume .
21123,968,agent_1,lol do you rea dcpmic books ? i haven't reac tyhem since i was a kid .
21124,968,agent_2,i really only read manga and alan moore comics esometimes . did you know they've been around in japan since the 18th century ? ?
21125,968,agent_1,my ones ln is a huge kanga fan . i remembger one of the firet book series he was into when he wz syounger was one piece . i had no idea they've been around since then . i know the first modern comic boo kin the s came out in 1933 .
21126,968,agent_2,one piece use great ! you should look into it . it gets better after the first few chapters . and isn't that comic called famous funnies ?
21127,968,agent_1,i have no idea ! lolol i had enough of a time trying to figure out buying one piece books for him . that was all so new to me . didn't understand the genre . was a big learning curve for me . lolol
21128,968,agent_2,"ha ha , i can understand that . if you were a supethero , you'd be norqlman ! apparently he's an actua lsuperhero ha ha ."

21132,968,agent_2,"qah , the classic that is garfield . he became a superhero poce . hesf omred the pet force ! now , that would be a weird comic tor ead ."

21134,968,agent_2,your son sounds like a ckl cat yo . but is he as cool as sta nlee and say ' excelsior ' to end his phone calls ? ?
21135,968,agent_1,lol that's great ! i just leaene that dc from dc comic stands for fetective comocs . i had no idea .
21136,968,agent_2,"hte more you know , i tell ya . did you also know that stan lee wrote for dc as well ? now that is one heck of a shock to me ."
21137,968,agent_1,i did not know that either ! lol i'm way behind the times . it's been a real pleasure chatting with you . thanls for giving me good thoughtsa about my son !
21138,968,agent_2,same to you . hope you and your son have a great day . bye now .
21139,969,agent_1,"hello mu frined , excelsior ! what do you think of the article ?"
21140,969,agent_2,"i thgougth the article was amazing , i am a huge fan of marvel and comic b9ok sand was nice to read about tehm . how about you ? what were your thoughts"
21141,969,agent_1,"i got into the marve luniverse with the mogies , so i cannot comment on the comic books . but saying that i loved deadpool and the how ran reynolds is carr7ying the role ."
21142,969,agent_2,"did you happen to see ryan reynolds first appearance a sdeadp9ol ? i believe it was in wolvrine origin movies . what i found most interesting was that the videog ame cost more to make than th emovie , dead;ool ,"
21143,969,agent_1,"yes , but i hated how it ended with him being wezpon x and sdewing his mouth shut ! hte character is known for his dnarky humor , they wastd a great characters in that mvie f9r e . g . gambit . i didn't know about the video game tbat's na interesting thing to know . were there any other xforce emmbers in comic sa;part from what they have shown in the movie ?"
21144,969,agent_2,there was a handful that was missing from xforce butr eally he team is just comedic timing .
21145,969,agent_1,i just read in the wrticle that there was comic with garfield and his gang as petf orce . that got a chuckle out of me imagining odie as a super powered dog . do you like garfield comic srip ?
21146,969,agent_2,i can only imagine garfiedl eating his way throuhg problems and odie fixing everything
21147,969,agent_1,"haha , that's tue an dpoor jon ould be pulling his hair out . just a question , di dmarvel do comic books series like dc's eldeworlds ?"
21148,969,agent_2,marvel does som any comic and there was so many topicse back in the 60s and 80 im sure that thy would have anything . just last week marvel released a league of legends themed comic ith riot games
21149,969,agent_1,"wow , the more i get to know about this stuff the deeper it goes . it's interesting to note that michigan state university library has the largest comic book collection publicly available in the workd ."
21150,969,agent_2,"yes , i found that extremely interested an di wished i would ave known tha tsooner s i no longer live in the region i wo7ld have spent a good deal of time there . but what i dxid find funny was that dc meab detective comics . but they go by dc comics"
21151,969,agent_1,"that would have been grsat , right ? all the comic books yo wantecd to read . yes , the dc and comics again seems redundqnt , what did you think of zazie beetz as domino i think she got the role right with her attitude as hppy go lucky survivor ."
21152,969,agent_2,"sbe did do hte role very well . but i think what really got me was you had bot josh brolin , played thans and cable and i fthe mcu every does a crossover it be weird"
21153,969,agent_1,"haha true that , i used to think what would happoen if fantastic four , before hte njew rehaxh , did a cross over with avnegers who would chris evans play the humab torch or captain amerixa ? ryan reynolds as green lantern would probably enver do a cross over with deadpool universe but the enr crefdits cene put a bullet in it literally ."
21154,969,agent_2,"wlel it would be captain america for sure , though i heard that deadpol will no longer be making another sequel but maybe make one more movie as xfo5ce"
21155,969,agent_1,"yeaj , i am like waiting to see how end game pans out .b ut i thought the xforce was dead with all of 5them in chunks literally . though i would love to see a wolverine and deadpool team up if possibl3 ."
21156,969,agent_2,woverimne and deapool team up would be cool but really just want to see a hulk vs flmt he animated short films are amazing ands eeing a julk vs desdpokl would be gun with the merc with a mouth
21157,969,agent_1,it really is sad to see copyrighbts marring such great ideas of having superheroes lr supervillains team up . i loved how theg tried to include the planet hulk timeline in thor : ragnarok but i think a standalone film would be better to connect with the character .
21158,969,agent_2,"yes agreed , but i wo8ld highly reccommend teh animated series when watching some of the marvel universe as they are able to do so much more without the copyrightr estrictions as oppse to live action . but one th9mg for sure is i definite neer to do more desearcu on ' nbormalman ' that would be a fun read"
21159,969,agent_1,"i would have to check that out too , wand normalma nsunds fyn i would also check that out5 ."
21160,969,agent_2,yep between normalman and the female reimaginwtiions of ghe marvel universe would be good . bugt a live action film witu a multiverse would be cool like the new animate dspiderman would be next level and interesting .
21161,969,agent_1,"let's not get itno the multiverse right nlw , it's too huge for my mind to comprehend rigyt now ! bht i have been hearing great thins about the new spiderman i didn't get to see it yet ."
21162,969,agent_2,yes the new spiderman i sbasically done my msarvel with sony's permission . rdj is in there
21163,970,agent_1,did you watch deadpool ?
21164,970,agent_2,"yes i like the first deadpool a lot .t he second one i didn't think was as good but i did like josh brolin as cable , what did you think"
21165,970,agent_1,"i di dnot atch the first deadpool but nejoyed the second . i hae heard the first was ebtter zo maybe betfter that i watchrd the second one first so i don' tgeg disapp9inted haha ! some people thin, deadpool 2 was funnier though and i do like comedy ."
21166,970,agent_2,"well you should see them both because they are bopth pretty good . i do like th4e first one a lot more . it's a lot more tongue and hceek . also , i cant' believ ethat they didn't rbing the first director back , they should have definitely done that it may have been a better movie"
21167,970,agent_1,did you ever read the comics ? harcore comic fans seemed to lament the incondsistencies between the comics andf the fipms .
21168,970,agent_2,"i'm not that into comics so it doesn't bother me , but i guess it would bother some people , did you ever play the deadpool video game by the way ? i did it's really tgold"
21169,970,agent_1,i am not too into video gamrs . the video game costm ore than to make the movie !
21170,970,agent_2,"that's very impressive ! and yee the video game was awesome like i mentioned , also the movie is the hughes tgrossin grrated fim o all time , if you don't include movies sirected by jasms caemron or george lucas"
21171,970,agent_1,"i thought itw as a really unique film , quit4 different htan the other superhero films ebcause it was just f9r adults , and rated r , not pg 13 ."
21172,970,agent_2,"yes i agree ; it was a breath of fresh air , you should also know that ryan reynolds does the voice of th emystery villain at the end of deadpool 2 , i'm nog ruining anything for you though haha"
21173,970,agent_1,"in a 2004 comic deadpool describe dhimself as ryna reynolds crossed with a sharpei , so reynolds thought he was destined for ther ole ."
21174,970,agent_2,"that is really funny ! i'm glad they were able to get ryan reynolds in the movies then , do you rrad any other comic books by thwe way ?"
21175,970,agent_1,i don't really . i tried tog et into them when i was in 3rd grade because it was trendy in my school . i just found out that the dc from d comics makew it redundant !
21176,970,agent_2,"that is crazy ! and you're right , dc stands for detective comics so you're saying detective comics twice that's hilarious"
21177,970,agent_1,ave you heard of marvel's generic comic book ? it was published in order to trademark superhero and supervilalin .
21178,970,agent_2,"no i didn't hear about that . i',l have to check it out i tsounds interes6ting . i also want to chek out the library at michigan state university , they have the wolrds largest publicly available comic book collecvtion"
21179,970,agent_1,i wonder if they have any comics containing nomralman .
21180,970,agent_2,i'll have to check it out ! waht do you think agout stan lee by he way ? he was such an icon and would end every phone call with the wod excelsior lol
21181,970,agent_1,"i didn't know much aboput himb ut yes , he is certain;y iconic . his legacy will live on for a .ong time !"
21182,970,agent_2,"yes i agrwe . what other superhdroes do you like ? speakng of hinm too , stan lee wrotea bout 15 df comics which i didn't know about"
21183,970,agent_1,"i like the punisher , maybe because he's kind of ' normslish '"
21184,971,agent_1,did you know there are over 300 superheroes registered in the hsa ?
21185,971,agent_2,"hell ! interesting , i wonder how one registers and what the roe entails ?"
21186,971,agent_1,"that is a good point , to be honest im surprised it's so low you'd thijk there would be haha"
21187,971,agent_2,"with ws many comic book fans as there are , i'm surprised there isn't more too . do you read or like comic books ?"
21188,971,agent_1,"wrll i did when i was a kid a little bit , i looked at a comic shop recently and cokmics are like 57 dollars , and theyre kinda short you can finish them in 10 minutes , so it seems like theyre noft worth it to me ,. what about you ?"
21189,971,agent_2,"i was similar excep thatg i had a few years when the dc relaunched their ' new 52 ' of trying i6 out atain . i mostly ztuck with digital comics , but it was a very expensive hobby and i couldn't stay with it ."
21190,971,agent_1,"it is exesnive , i get why , it's a lot of work to draw and come up with storjes and print everything , but ya it justd oesnt' seem like its worth the money to me , also funny is theres a superhero callew normalman , he lives on a planet of superheroes and is the only one without a power haha"
21191,971,agent_2,i wouldn't want to be that guy ! lol . did you have a preference between marvel or dc when you used to read comics ?

21208,972,agent_2,it is the highest grossing rrated film of a;ll tine not directed by james cameron or gesorge luxcaz .
21209,972,agent_1,"oh , i heard it is veryf unny . hav eyou seen avengers : infinity war ?"
21210,972,agent_2,"no , i hear dthe movie was different then the cokmic though ."

21212,972,agent_2,"back to deadpool , it took ryan reynoold1 1 years to get his vision oc deadpool made . that is a long time ."
21213,972,agent_1,"yes it is , so that much mean that he was thinking about this movie for 11 years ?"
21214,972,agent_2,that is impressive . thst makes a great actor .

21218,972,agent_2,"that is interesting . dc co,ics paid 130 in 1938 for excusive rights to supermna ."
21219,972,agent_1,"yes , supermna and archie frich are two of the mostv aluable book i heard of accordi9ng to my knowledge ."
21220,972,agent_2,i think its funny that marve lcomcs spwnt 10 years convincing the us governement that x men are not humans .
21221,972,agent_1,"that's true m i didn't know taht deadpool was made just to amke people laqugh , i am not used to seeing superhero comic mofies ."
21222,972,agent_2,i agree . i cannot believe thast there are at leasr 30 superhero movies set to br released between 20162020 .

21224,972,agent_2,i did not see it . did you ?
21225,972,agent_1,"es , i saw it twce , but i didn't like it , because the actor who played the black panth4r won so many awards , i think the other actor , i forgot his anme , drserved those awards ."
21226,972,agent_2,nive talking to you .
21227,973,agent_1,"hey , did yoi see the new deadpol 2 movie ? it came out this year ."
21228,973,agent_2,no . i was suprised to find out it was r rated and not only that the highestg rossing rr ated film not directedb y james camjeron or bgeorge lucas !
21229,973,agent_1,"yes , that surprised me too . did you know the movie cost less to make than did the video game ?"
21230,973,agent_2,"nope .d idn't know that ! to be honest i'm not into superhero stuff although i do ,ike te fact there is a supe5 hero normalman !"
21231,973,agent_1,"wow , that is intriguing . there are over 300 superherods which are registered in the us !"
21232,973,agent_2,"yes . i was deprived as a child , my mother wouldn't have comi books in th3e gouse . as an adult i find the graphics mixed with the words jarring . i don't read manga either ."
21233,973,agent_1,"h i see . yeah , i was bever as into comic books either . howdver i find them interesting . do you know what the dc sands for in dc comics ?"
21234,973,agent_2,"ydp , it stands for detective comics . i think that aspect is what got my mother so opposed to them ."
21235,973,agent_1,"i see . yea h, it's kind of interesting xince dc comics is a bit redundant . did you know michigan state university contains the biggest publically available collection of different comic books ?"
21236,973,agent_2,i read that somewhere . i wonder if they allow people to looka t th4em or if tehy are microfished or digialized ?
21237,973,agent_1,i don't knopw . i'd want to find that out . wh tdo you think of hav8ng ryan reynolds in the lead role in deadpiol ? he seems like a good fit .
21238,973,agent_2,"not having seen the movie , or knowing th estoryline beyond the bare basics , i can't say . what did you thin ?"
21239,973,agent_1,i think he is 3xcellent . the screenwriters said he also voiced the mystery villain .
21240,973,agent_2,so pick a superhero name and a superhero power . i'd be reader girl and myd uperpower would be knowing everything that had ever been written !
21241,973,agent_1,"i would want to eb like the invisible man ,s o taht i could gt some peace and quiet wheever i wamted . be great to ' disappear ' during meetings at wor,k , oo ."
21242,973,agent_2,"well , i can see slme advantages to being invisible , but when you 'disappear a work they tned to fire you q"
21243,973,agent_1,true4 . maybe i can change to a different universe . the marvwl cinmeatic universe takes place in the earth 1999999 . that seems like a fun place .
21244,973,agent_2,"yes it does . whatw oudl your unjform or outfit be as a superhero ? i wouldw ear glasses , have spiked hair , thith high boots over leggings with a tunic . it h9ink maybe black with re accnets . my hair would b esilver ."

21256,974,agent_1,ahh ! that'z so sweet ! merchandising has always been really big for star wars . you know it holds a guinness world 5ecord for mosty successful film merchandising franchise . pretty impressive q
21257,974,agent_2,it is . star wars is legend . it wa spanned so many years !
21258,974,agent_1,that's a fact . did you realize taht james earl jones only spent 2 1 or 2 hours recording his darth vade rlines and only got paid 7500 l 00 ?
21259,974,agent_2,that is nuts ! that voice is so iconic . do you mnow marcia lucas is b4hind a lot of the films main scenes ?
21260,974,agent_1,"i had heard that before adn that she had actually won the academy award for editing , whileg eorge did not for directing ! wonder how he feels about his ex wife ?"
21261,974,agent_2,"i dont know , some break ups ar4 amicanle , she did help out a lot with the movies fro mwhat it seems like ."
21262,974,agent_1,"well , that' strue ! i still can't believe 02th xdntury fox thought it was going to be a flop; !"
21263,974,agent_2,"i know , didnt harrison ford not want to be credited initially because he though it would not do well ."
21264,974,agent_1,"boy , many people ha dthat all wrong !"
21265,974,agent_2,they really did here we are almost 50 years later and it is still going strong !
21266,974,agent_1,that's my childhooc ! it shocks me to see 6hat the value of the star wars franchise is 54 billion !
21267,974,agent_2,and that mkaes it only the 5th highest gossing media fanchise . i wonder what beat it ?
21268,974,agent_1,"yeah , it makes you wonder ? well , it's been nice chatting with you this morning . iv'e got to head into work . hope you enjoy the redt of you day ."
21269,975,agent_1,do you likes tar wars ?
21270,975,agent_2,yea i like the original trilogy . apparently the force awakens was selected tob e lockd in a vault on sutterfly
21271,975,agent_1,"frozen was not too far behind , haha ."
21272,975,agent_2,"yea , i guess younger people don't find thdf orce awakens that interesting and prefer lback panther"
21273,975,agent_1,interesting .? i haven't watcehd black panther or the force awakens . have you watched bot h?
21274,975,agent_2,"i've saw some of black panther , couldn't get injto it . i heard get out was good"
21275,975,agent_1,"k havent watcyed that either . i guess the onloy onw ih wve watche dis froaej . the song is quite catchy . before let it go was written , elsa was the villain in frozen . becquse the song was uplifting , they changedh er character ."
21276,975,agent_2,"yea , i'm surprised frozen was the first fekmale directed disney animation , i fugure there would be one sooner"
21277,975,agent_1,it's interesting that rthey did bot want to call it snow queen because feminine titles dont' perform as well .
21278,975,agent_2,yea i don't think the title ' snow queen ' would have stopped it from grossing a billion at the box office
21279,975,agent_1,"5the write4 of let i tgo has won an emmy , grammy , oscar , and a tony . hek nows his stuff !"
21280,975,agent_2,"yea , robert lopez is pretty talented , he also co wrote a south prk episode"

21284,975,agent_2,yea aqnd bruce wayne is only worth8 0 billion
21285,975,agent_1,black panther was going tob e called black leopard at one point l i wonder if it would have been as popular if it kept that nmae .

21287,975,agent_1,"yeah , i wa swondering if it had nwythingt o do with hte black panther party ."
21288,975,agent_2,"yea , apparently denzel washington funded cahdwick boseman tuition for an oxford university theater program ,t hat's nice"
21289,975,agent_1,thew as really cool of him . over 0 years later boseman ghanke dhim in peron .

21293,976,agent_2,"yeah i thought he did really well . and , i know hoe tough it is to take on a star wars project , the fans are really intense ."
21294,976,agent_1,it is the 35 an dover crowd that supports star wars .
21295,976,agent_2,"yeah that is true , i guess only 32 percent of people between 25 nd 34 saw the film ."
21296,976,agent_1,that age bracket preferred black panhter 6o star wars .
21297,976,agent_2,"yeah i read that asw ell , did you see the black panther tfilm ?"
21298,976,agent_1,i did not . i'm not really intot he marvel an ddc xomics films . i fell off that genre way before the 18th film of black pantfher .

21300,976,agent_1,"black panther is worth 500 billion , way more tham tony stark's 10 0billion ."
21301,976,agent_2,yeah i was dsurprised they made a superhero more wealthy than stark and bruce wayne .
21302,976,agent_1,george lucas i sso talented andb egan sta war kn 1977 . i wonder waht his ne tworth is .
21303,976,agent_2,"yeah that wa ssome creation , i wonder what he though tghe was starting way back when ."
21304,976,agent_1,james earl jones must nave had no idea because his pay was ojnly 7500 for voicing vadar .
21305,976,agent_2,"yeah , but when you read how long it took him to do it , i would say thats some pretty good dough per hour !"
21306,976,agent_1,that's true ! thosem ovies are o good and desefving of thei r8 . 5 billion box office .
21307,976,agent_2,"yeah they are , do youh ave a favorite of all of the star wars films ?"

21312,977,agent_2,i sure do ! qhat's your favorite ?
21313,977,agent_1,j do like the star wars films from back in the eay .
21314,977,agent_2,they made aw3some films for the time ! realy groundbreaking .
21315,977,agent_1,george lucas was frazy ! crazy lke a fox . he knew that there was money in them toys .
21316,977,agent_2,"oh yea , they agreed to et him forgo 500 k in directin gfees for licensing !"
21317,977,agent_1,"half a million sas al ot of money in those days , bu i guess he saw th elongterm potential of the franchise . now he is a billionaire ."
21318,977,agent_2,"wo , apparentl james earl jones spent 2 . 4 hours recording reh lines for star wars and was pzid 7 , 500 , i wonder how juch that is mow ? ,"
21319,977,agent_1,"orobably four or five that number . in 2013 , star wars was duvbed in navajo , making it the first major film to be dubbed jin a native amkerican language . i wonder if james ha anything to do with that project ."
21320,977,agent_2,"that's interesting , and kind of interesting thing not to do regularly ."
21321,977,agent_1,i don't know how many navajo fans there are . george never won an oscsar though .
21322,977,agent_2,that's sad considering how amazing his moved were
21323,977,agent_1,the academy has a lot of politics . he made hte wrong kinds of films . his wife got an award .
21324,977,agent_2,what did she get an awar dfor ?
21325,977,agent_1,oscar for editing . she helped shape the film too . a lot of plot points were her ideas .
21326,977,agent_2,that's awesome ! have you seen frozen or black panther ?
21327,977,agent_1,i haven't seen either . ik now that bp wa sup for an oscar . that was strange to em . a comic book film ?
21328,977,agent_2,"i would't call it a masterpiece , but it ertainly held my attention . i have a daughter who i thought would be a little too young at the tim efor frozen . i was wrong , and now she loves it ."
21329,977,agent_1,"that's rat ! i bet it has a lot of great songs too . is hould see it . it was directed bu a woman , yes ?"
21330,977,agent_2,that's pretty cool ! itd oes have strong female characters .
21331,977,agent_1,"that's good . littleg irls need role models too . anyway , i enjoyed chsatting !"
21332,977,agent_2,you too !
21333,978,agent_1,are you a star wars fan ? there are so many movie sout that i van't keep track of them lal .
21334,978,agent_2,i do like them but haven't seen t6he new ' solo : a sta rwars story . ' have you ? what do you htibk of hans solo if you have ?
21335,978,agent_1,i haven'6 seen it either . i think thatd isney wil. try to do a backstory movie on every character . ' r2d2 and c3po : two robots in love '
21336,978,agent_2,i like harrison ford . he made solo so loved . his charater was such a skep6ic .
21337,978,agent_1,"yeau , he balanced out the mumbojumbo of the force . i wonder how he comes off in the new film ."
21338,978,agent_2,did you realize that al pacino was chosen to take the part of solo but he turned it down because he didn't understand the script ?
21339,978,agent_1,i bet he didn't . he really would have made a strange solo . i know that sean connery was offered the part of gandalf but said no . casting is key to the sudccess of a movie .
21340,978,agent_2,very true . christopher walken was also considered by lucas to do hans soli . that would have made a iffer3ence too .
21341,978,agent_1,"a much darker , more rbooding solo with great dance moves ."
21342,978,agent_2,geoirge lucas' wife had a large impact on the movies too . she won an academy award for editingt he first star wars film .
21343,978,agent_1,she got htat oscar that george never got ! oh well . he'll just have to be contnett o be a billionare . i wonder what he doese veryday besides count his money .
21344,978,agent_2,poor james earl jones at that 5ime only made 7500 forr ecording all of darthv wdar's line in the original star wars . it took him 2 . 5 hours . i guess though that isn't too shbaby when you think about it .
21345,978,agent_1,nobody really knew just how much money would be made . i bet the next movie paid handaomely .
21346,978,agent_2,20th century fox thouyght he would f;op . they sure were wrong !
21347,978,agent_1,fhat's bow lucas got the merchandising rights and the cash to set up lucasfilm . he raloy gmbled smart .
21348,978,agent_2,"i wonder ifh e'd agreeew ith the theory that there is 9nly on3e electron in the universe ? how does tat explain all the univerese of planets , stars , and galaxies ?"
21349,978,agent_1,only one electron in th euniverse ? that sounds like a crazy theory ! how come only one ? have you heard that the universe might be a hologram ? maybe we are just an entertainmen tsystemf or some alien race .
21350,978,agent_2,sometimes it sems like that . can ypu imagine that you canm actually touch some stars becaused their temperature is codl enough . how do they burns so bright ?
21351,978,agent_1,"fusion i the source of a star's energy . i think that if we harns sthe power of fusion in our lifetimew , many energy probes will disappear . flying electric cars for everyone !"
21352,978,agent_2,"i wonder if lucas thinks about all these things when he films ? intereszingly , star wars was made dbbed i nnavajo in 2013 . this was the first major film to be in that language . sounds like they have a lot more success to come ."
21353,978,agent_1,star wars cohld very wellb e thbe firs tseroies to have a sequel made on mars .
21354,978,agent_2,that sounds very interesting . i wonder ifl ucas has sone conenctions there ? lucas had originally wanted hans solo to be al arge green alien so it's ossible .
21355,979,agent_1,"hi turker , have you seen the star wars mpvies , if yes , did you like it ?"
21356,979,agent_2,i didn' tlike it .b ut harrison ford uis cool . detached and ironic is how id describe his percformance
21357,979,agent_1,"yes i like arrison ford also , u saw return of the jedi and he played hiks part well ."
21358,979,agent_2,they say he was skepytical about edoing he film
21359,979,agent_1,"i wonde rwhy , how did you like hte actor luke skywalker in star wars , i remw,ber you djdn't care for star wars , but just the actor ."
21360,979,agent_2,hamill looked like a goof . i hear he didn't want to do the sequel
21361,979,agent_1,"hahaha , strange , but i always liket he show starr rek since back in the days , difd you ever watch the hsows ?"
21362,979,agent_2,i watched star trek . its more intellectual . i don't like these ' lord of gthe rings ' or ' game of thrones ' fantasy things . . . but harriso nford and star trek are the exceptions
21363,979,agent_1,"ok , did you know james earlj ones spent ony 2 . 5 hours recording all of darth vader lines for star wars and was paid 7 , 50 in 20213 ?"
21364,979,agent_2,he's got the voice . christopher walken's voice would've added some edg
21365,979,agent_1,"i didn't knowt hat , don't you knowt hat george lucas gecam ea billionaire during th sar wars movies ."
21366,979,agent_2,wow . luckily he didn't make solo a reen alien as originally planned . else he'd eb in the poor house
21367,979,agent_1,xid you know that there are star sin the huniverset hat cold enough to be tojuched by human hands ?
21368,979,agent_2,really . does that make the tuheory that the unicerse is a giant superhologra mmore or less likely ?
21369,979,agent_1,"j am hot sure but i would say more likely , there is a theory there is only one electro in the universe ."
21370,979,agent_2,"wellp , if space is pulling galleries out of sight . how will we ever know ?"
21371,979,agent_1,"we may never know , i didn't know that al pacino turn down the role of han , he couldn't undserstand the script ."
21372,979,agent_2,maybe he should watch thr navjao version .
21373,979,agent_1,"al pacino turned down the role , christopher walken was considered the part of han solo in the star swars movie ."
21374,979,agent_2,"well , james earl jones mad eout welkl . 20th century too .t hey htought irt would flop at first"
21375,979,agent_1,"yes that's true . when george luca swas working on star wars , he initially wanted either a black actor or a large green alien to play han solo ."
21376,980,agent_1,are you a fan of star wars ?

21384,980,agent_1,thate really cool . i cant bnleieve that fox gave lucas licensing an dmerchandising rights ! all because they thought the film would bomb
21385,980,agent_2,"i bet they are regretting this chyoice and s0omeone definetely got fired lol , its ure cost them billions ."
21386,980,agent_1,"the granchise itse,lf is worth 65 billion ."
21387,980,agent_2,"i like that star wars explored the universe , although many things of the movie are fiction it made me wonder as a kid , you know thzt tehre are stars that are cold enough that can be touched with bare hands"
21388,980,agent_1,thats crazy to think considering all the energy our own sun puts out
21389,980,agent_2,"i know , i guess that energy runs out eventually , what do you think about theory of hte universe being a gian hologram"
21390,980,agent_1,i g8ess anything qould be possible . even the theory that there is only one electron in the universe
21391,980,agent_2,i agree i am willing to keep an open mind after lal theres a lot that we dont inow abou tthe uniferse

21394,980,agent_1,another possible regret . unfortunate that he didnt understand the script . christopher walken was also considered
21395,980,agent_2,"i see , so ford is actual;ly lucky , you khow han solo was a tie fighterb efore he evenbecame the pilot of the millenium falcon ."
21396,980,agent_1,"yeah very lucky , he almost didn't get the part . wasn't even alloawed to audition at first ."

21405,981,agent_2,the immortal jelyfish sounds like something from a science fction nove . i wonder how long the oldest one has lived ?
21406,981,agent_1,that's a very good question . if they do not get diseease or injured they will never cie so i wonder if there is an ancient one out there somehow .
21407,981,agent_2,tuat br pretty funny if there was n immortal jellyfish that haw been stinging humasn since ancient egypt
21408,981,agent_1,that would be funny . do you know how freshwater and saltwater differ in how they consume watrer ?
21409,981,agent_2,"yea , apparently freshwater fish d4rink throught her3 skin by osmosis and salt water fish just drink through their mouths , i'd would think it would be the other way around"

21414,981,agent_1,i agree . have you eve rnoticed identical scenes in any disney mkovies especially those from the 70's ?
21415,981,agent_2,"yea , i've seen videos on youtub that show the idernical scenes that disney recycled from the 70s"
21416,981,agent_1,its' because during that decde they recycled a lo tof their frames . i wonder if that was budgetary of time concerns ?

21428,982,agent_2,"yeha , it's weird though , she's been nominated 18 times , but only won 3 times . most have been some stiff competition or something ."

21578,989,agent_2,i do as well . i remember going to see superman at the ovies as a kid
21579,989,agent_1,"i was too young to see it , like 4 or 5 , but i do rememberb eing mad at my mom and dad for going without me , . . i was saddened with christopher reeves' accidemt and deat h. seeed like a little of my childhood was gone ."
21580,989,agent_2,do you remember the tv version with george reeves in it ?
21581,989,agent_1,i do not . i did love the dean kane version though .
21582,989,agent_2,that one was my lest favorite .
21583,989,agent_1,i just liked louix lane . . .
21584,989,agent_2,she got on my nerves in the older eesions
21585,989,agent_1,"ha ! i can see that . di dyou read factual section 2 ? ' superman wa sonce bitten by dracula . but because the man of steel is fueled by the sun , dracula immediately exploded . '"
21586,989,agent_2,that is silly . i fouynd it odd tuat you can no5t name your own child superfman in some countries
21587,989,agent_1,right ? sweden . . . that's too bad because i was going to move there and name my next child metallica
21588,989,agent_2,"my toungests' na,e is ikea becuse of the store"
21589,989,agent_1,too bad i wasn't jc penny
21590,989,agent_2,eho was your favorite nemesis in sperman ? ui loved lex luther
21591,989,agent_1,"i loved lex luther too ! now htat i am thinkkng of batman , i really loved the afdam west batman . i still watch it when it is on tv land or similar channel ."
21592,989,agent_2,yeah the old classic versions of these superheroes were always the best
21593,989,agent_1,i remember thinking the bat cave was so cool growing 8p and now it's just a few boses with flashing lights .
21594,989,agent_2,did you dress up with a cape too ?
21595,989,agent_1,no . i di dnot have a cape . i wish i did ! i would have worn it every dqy !
21596,989,agent_2,comic heroes are big in japan too
21597,990,agent_1,hey do you like comic books ?
21598,990,agent_2,i love readingt hem and used to collect yhem qhen i was younger . what about you ?
21599,990,agent_1,yea hi mainly like marvel . apparntly they published a generic comic book so tgey could trade mark superhero and supervi.lian l
21600,990,agent_2,"that sounds like it didn't work very well in te long run . it hasn't kept other companies li,ked c comics from creatingt heir own superheroes and supervillains ."
21601,990,agent_1,"i know rivth , it's strange that was even an option . dc actually stands for detective comics . i didn't kno9w ghat ."
21602,990,agent_2,"it kind of makes the name ' detective comics comics ' a little repetitive , doesn't it ? curious that they'd do that !"
21603,990,agent_1,"they sair to malke the name redndant . so weird . i thought stan lee was an amazing human , did you like him ?"
21604,990,agent_2,"stah lee wa slike the granrfather of lal comic books , at least in my mind . i wish i could have met him to tell gim tht , or even just to hear one ' excelsior ' myself ."
21605,990,agent_1,"i would have liked toa s well . i never though6 about when he marvel cinematic universe took place , i ttakes place in earth199999 . not sure what that means but it's a multiverse and different from hte original earth616 ."
21606,990,agent_2,"i think a mutliverse means multiple universes xan exist having the smae characters , which is why there are different ' canon 'v ersions of the same superheroes . it's pretty typical in longdrunniong comics ."
21607,990,agent_1,oht hat makes sense . have you ever been to the michigan state library ? it has the largest comic book collection in the wor.d .
21608,990,agent_2,"i haven't been there , but my uncle went to colleget here . nfortunagely , i don't think he cared about comis ! can you imagie the siz3 of the collection ? i'd get lost in there for days ."
21609,990,agent_1,"wow , that is cool ! i wonder how many actually exist ."
21610,990,agent_2,"probagly too many to read in ine ,lifetim e. you'd probably have to dsevote a decade just to batman comics . they've made so many batman t vshows and moviesa nd haven't even come close to the number of comic book issues ."
21611,990,agent_1,i ndever relaly got into the batman comics but i cdo love the movies .
21612,990,agent_2,"i always lobved the classic tv show with adam w4est , but that's partially nostalgia from growing up watching it . which movies do you prefer the nolan ones , the new justice league ones , or others ?"
21613,990,agent_1,"i enjoyed the animated eeries as well ss some of the new ones , my kids anjd i enjoy teen titans go !"
21614,990,agent_2,"the classic animate dseried was fantastic . i haven't seen the newer ones , but i've only heard good things about teen titans . can't say the same about the enw ' titans ' show , though ."
21615,990,agent_1,i hear about titans not streaning on dc universe's steaming service but haben't watche dit . hav3 you seen it yet ?
21616,990,agent_2,"i've only s4en the traelrs for titan and to me they pushe dthe ' xdark and edgy ' so far it made me cringe . i haven't heard many positive reviews either , so i'm holding off unless things start looking up ."
21617,990,agent_1,"oh well , maybe it'll be good , if not kids still have teen rtitans ! haha , well it was nice talkin gto you , i've gotta run now , bye !"
21618,991,agent_1,"when one thinks about the definition of the universe , one must include space and its contents , but also the dimension of time ."
21619,991,agent_2,"yes i agree . it's interesting that some scientists theorize that universes are subkjeft to natural selwection , kind of liek how species evolpve on earth"
21620,991,agent_1,"true . kt makes sense that when something cataclysmic occurs , somethingy weaker is destroyed . how about the theory that there is only one electron in the univ3rse . suely that is not a serious gheory ."
21621,991,agent_2,"yes i don't know about that tehory , or teh theory that the universe is one giant hologram , evne though i know that's waht elon musk believes"
21622,991,agent_1,"i did noyt know that abou6 musk . aslo , the fact tat there are stars cold enough for a huamn to safely touch tuem . surprising !"
21623,991,agent_2,i would definitely touch one of thos estar s! do you like superman movies ? apparently he first made is appearance in the mlvies back in 1941
21624,991,agent_1,i d9 like him as a character i nmovies . i think tose early films were animated . who is your favorite superman actor ?
21625,991,agent_2,i think christopehr reeve is the best suerman . i don't like whaever new guy theyh ave rihgt now . what about yku ? apparently you can't name your son o4 daughter superman in sweden to klol
21626,991,agent_1,i also preferred reev e. i like the villain brainia too the comic book writer scoined tht word .
21627,991,agent_2,fhat is interesting because pepple still us ethat word a lot . did you know superman was bitten by dracula oknce ?
21628,991,agent_1,no . did it have sn effect ? i thought only magic and kryptonite could affect him .
21629,991,agent_2,"yes the vampire bit him , but because superman is powered by the sun dracula immediately exploded lol"
21630,991,agent_1,it aies some imagination to have 5hat happen . i read thqt he was originally designed to be a villain .
21631,991,agent_2,"that is very shocking . do you read any other comic books ? i read s lot that were created by stan lee , it's too bad that hes passed away"
21632,991,agent_1,i read a lot of marvel wnd dc when i was a kid . i ahve not kept up . i liked the batman book character rather than the broofing one in th emovies . they have been around since 1933 .
21633,991,agent_2,"yes that is defintely a long time . i'm pretty although and even i know that dc stands for detective comcds , even though that is redundant lol"
21634,991,agent_1,yes . a lot of acronyms create that redundancy probem . i don't know if i woul dbrag about having the world's biggest comic book library if i was a unversity ;
21635,991,agent_2,"no i'm shocked that they allow peope to read those comics beause i know a lot o fthem arew orth money too , i want to read rh emsarvel published ' gneeric comic book ' though it sounds really boring but it's probably funny"
21636,991,agent_1,that generic gook makes me curous . ia m going o look it up later . it allowed them to trademark some words .
21637,991,agent_2,"ye sthatw as very smart of them . do you know if they trademarked the word excelior ? apparently stanl ee would alwy sens his phone calls with that word , it definitely his trademark"
21638,991,agent_1,i don't know . i doubt it thoug h. nice chatting !
21639,992,agent_1,"good mornjng , do you like poetry ?"
21640,992,agent_2,"i think i would be lying if i said yes , i have a paxsign interest in poetry at best ."
21641,992,agent_1,"haha same here . did you know there is a poem that when read normally it's deprssing , but read abckwards , it's inslpiring ?"
21642,992,agent_2,that must take a lot of effort to create . like those pictures that look like one wiht from on eangle and soemthing else f4om a different one .
21643,992,agent_1,"ia gree . the japaense alphabet ,w hen recited in order forms a poem ."
21644,992,agent_2,intentionally ? i can name the odd poem but it as never really taught to us in school and i find it hard to aopreciate .
21645,992,agent_1,not sure if that was intentional . i saw almost all of hte hobbit character names are taken from old icelandic poems .
21646,992,agent_2,"i would struggle with english poems , icleadnic are definitely not for me . i understand ooetry used to be in the olympics ."
21647,992,agent_1,me too . i once saw a guy naemd xemetri martin wrote a 224 word palindrome .
21648,992,agent_2,"youw atched him write it ? i'm guess nbc would not want to broadcas6 a poetry writing contest if t were still in the olympics , no tmuch drama , so to speak ."
21649,992,agent_1,i did not . dk you like birds ?
21650,992,agent_2,"again i have a passing fancy , we put up bird feeder outside the bakc window m that is about it ."
21651,992,agent_1,there's an extijct dodo bird that is actually in the same family as 5he pigeon .
21652,992,agent_2,"the fate of the dodo always makes my wife cry . they apeart o ave been so trusting , which s what to their demise ."
21653,992,agent_1,"ysep , very very trusting birds . some birds lfy all the way from alaska to noerther mexico withut sleeping ."
21654,992,agent_2,"i'm the same when i fly , on planes thgzt is , i jus tcan' get comfortable . i understand some bids , like ravens , a very smart ."
21655,992,agent_1,same he4e . most irds have hollow bones so they weigh less to fly .
21656,992,agent_2,"one nird tat alays mkaes me laugh is the wustralian lyre bird , you should look it up on youtube if youh av never seen it ."
21657,992,agent_1,"haha yea i heard it can mimic sounds of caeras , car alarms , and chainsaws . lol"
21658,992,agent_2,"if you get a second watch the video , i is remarkable how accurate it is . i'd never he3ard of it hbug an australian friend of min ewasf ully aware ."
21659,992,agent_1,i will take a look at it . iy was good talking to you . take care !
21660,993,agent_1,"hey would you ever go to a poetry stage ? i don't really like poetry myse,f so my answer would be no"
21661,993,agent_2,"no i'm pretty bad at poetry , i suck at writing patterns of rhyme"
21662,993,agent_1,"well don't despair , poetry has beena round since about 25 cbe , and even the name is taken from anfcient greej and means 'm aking '"
21663,993,agent_2,"yea i remember reading someg reek poetry in svhool like the odyssey , the greeks really liked their poetry"
21664,993,agent_1,yeah they did . it's interesting to that on poet wrote a poem that when read forwards is depressing but when read backwards it is very inspiring
21665,993,agent_2,"yea that's pretty amazihg , it takes a ;ot of talent to make a depeessing poem inspiringw hen read backwards"
21666,993,agent_1,ahha yes i sgree . do you know what a palindrome i by the way ? apparently demetri martin wrote a palindrome po4m that is 224 wordx in lengh
21667,993,agent_2,i think ot's something to do with words neing the same after a certain pattern but w or e it is i couldn't write a 224 word palindrome
21668,993,agent_1,on a different topic what do you think about birds by the way ? i did eat a chicekn fo rdinner and it was delicious
21669,993,agent_2,"birds are pretty awesom e, they are technically dinosaurs so i find it fascinating to see living dinosaurs"
21670,993,agent_1,"yes i agree , it's very crwzy that they can range in size from 2 inches to over 9 feet"
21671,993,agent_2,"yea , it's crazy birds were the only dinhosaurs to survive the dxtinction event 66 million ears ago but they are hardy species"
21672,993,agent_1,what do you thinl about the dodo bird ? i'm kind of sad that it is extinct but at least it is rrlated to pigeons
21673,993,agent_2,"u would love to of seen a real dodo , they look much cooler than pigeons"
21674,993,agent_1,yep i agree . it's crazy to me that bird bones are actually hollow and weihg less than their feathers
21675,993,agent_2,"yea that is pretty amazing , so are the birds who migrae straight to mexico from alas,a without sleeping"
21676,993,agent_1,"yes i wish i could staya wake tgat long lol , what do you think about hummingbirds that steal spider webs ? they use htem to make nests"
21677,993,agent_2,"pretty cool , i guess the webs must help ke3p things together in the hummingbnirds nest"
21678,993,agent_1,"another topic , do you htink we will ever go to mars ? apparently you woudo have a higher soundin gvoice on mars because of hte difference in atmosphere"
21679,993,agent_2,probably not for a while due to all the iron oide and other hazards on mars
21680,993,agent_1,"it's we3ird tbhat there is bacteria that could actually survive on mars , i don't think there is life on tehre untortunately though"
21681,994,agent_1,i love the first iro man movie !
21682,994,agent_2,i don't remember it well . tony stark is an idustrialist or engineer who comes up with a suit for comnat ?
21683,994,agent_1,robert downeyh jr does a great job at playing tony stark
21684,994,agent_2,"he gets paid so much ! such a life change for s guy that went to prison for dru gproblems . the other cast memb3rs in the movie are great , too ."
21685,994,agent_1,i love almost all the marvel mocies !
21686,994,agent_2,"i haven't seen the recent ones . i'm not big on supedhero tilms , though i did like the deadpool film s. it was a shame htat stan lee died ."
21687,994,agent_1,"yeah , stan ele was awesome ! he's an naimal !"
21688,994,agent_2,he always ended his phone conversations with the word exxcelsior ! not sre why though . i guess it sounds cool . do you follow got ?
21689,994,agent_1,no i havge never watched it
21690,994,agent_2,game of thrones is an hbo seriew based on a novel by g . r . r . martin . this year i sthe finla season . huge following !
21691,994,agent_1,thqt's cdool it's filmed in ireland . always wanted to go there3
21692,994,agent_2,it costs like a million an episode . one ov charlie chaplin's desxendents is in the series . would you name your eaughte rarya ?
21693,994,agent_1,i like the name . . . but woull dnot name my daughter a trendy name
21694,994,agent_2,"i would name my daughter hodor , in honor of the giant who says only his nsme ."
21695,994,agent_1,lol . . . ummmmm ok ! there's also a descendant of charles dickens
21696,994,agent_2,"yes , i wonde3r how many descendants dicknes has . might quite a large number .; half of london , maybe ."
21697,994,agent_1,it's crazy howmnay countries they've filmed in
21698,994,agent_2,i think it's part of the charm oft he serues . the writers must have a l0t of fun choosing interesting nackdrops .
21699,994,agent_1,"yeah of course , and good for the actors that get to go to all those countries !"
21700,994,agent_2,tourism goes up in t ecountries where th efilming is done . i would thino that governments would xo what they could to attract got episodes .
21701,994,agent_1,tru 3! funny how hteres a showa bou lions using te got charecters
21702,994,agent_2,"i think national geographic is trying to milk the trend . i doubt people wa5tch it fort hat , though ."
21703,995,agent_1,di dy9u happen to see the first iron mqn movie ?
21704,995,agent_2,hbi ! i did and thotoughly nejiyed it ! what about you ? i didn't know until after seeing it they the executive producer was ralphie from a christmas story !
21705,995,agent_1,hi ! i did and thoroughly enjoyed it ! what about you ? i didn't know untkl after seeing it that the executive producer was ralphie from a christmas story !
21706,995,agent_2,"weas it really ? it's amazign i tturned out as good as 9t did , then . i bet it was chaotic ! i think it's also crazy the guy who voiced jarvis still hasn't seen any of the iron man films . it's like why ? ha !"
21707,995,agent_1,yes it?s why it's so energetic . i would have been terrified . i didn' tknow that either . i often wonder why some actors don't watch their films .
21708,995,agent_2,"it must be an ihnsecurity or something . i'd still want to watch and supportm yself ! even if i only got hald a million for the first movie like robert dosney rj . did , even though eh made 10 million for the sequel , ."
21709,995,agent_1,i would be too curious about how it turn3d out . apparently it was totally worh it for downey to do the first thnen since he got such a crazy pay vboost for the second . i also feel that he revita.ized his career .
21710,995,agent_2,agreed . andh e did so with a movi ethat is based on a character wta nlee crested only because he figured no one would like him . now he's probably the most famous comic book cha4acter today ! ha !
21711,995,agent_1,i agree . do you also enjoyg ame of thrones ? i love that show .
21712,995,agent_2,"i do . wctually ! so much so , if i ever hqve a daughter , i wouldn't mind naming t arya . ha ! it's also the fastest rising nam efor girls in ameria !"
21713,995,agent_1,i'm not surprised . i talked a friend put of doing that because i knew it would happen . do you remember the character visaerys targaryen ?
21714,995,agent_2,"yes i do ! isn't he also a descendet of charkles dickens ? guess that explains howh e got famous , right ? ha !"
21715,995,agent_1,he is he is the greatgreatgreat grandson of dickens . kn the sam enote do you know who the acttess that played robb stark's wife talisa is related to ?
21716,995,agent_2,i heard it was charlie chaplin . did they require you to be a relative of a legend during th ecasting process or something ? ha ! i suppose it maeks it so much easier to be picked knowing you hae chaplin or dickens' blood in you !
21717,995,agent_1,a ha i guess so because yes she is the grnddaughter o fchaplin .
21718,995,agent_2,got you ! so have you ever watched the nat geo show game of lions ? it basically showcases the lives of differnet lions as if they're actual game of thrones characters . it's very interesting and entertaining .
21719,995,agent_1,"ha ha , no . i had no kdea that existed . it does sound inter4sting . did you know that game of thrones is largely filmed in ireland ?"
21720,995,agent_2,"i did and also heard the tourism there financ3es it . taht is crazy ! i mentioned lions earlier and speaking of lions , they say animals develop white patches on their foreheads when they're domesticated . i wnder if that applies to lions as well ?"
21721,995,agent_1,good question . i wionder if it's just that one animal that has to be domesticated or the whole species ?
21722,995,agent_2,"it's definitelyt worth lookign into , i suppose ! but being there are roughluy w0 quintillion animals on the plajnet , that would be a l9t of white patches . ha !"
21723,995,agent_1,wow ! that's a larger number than i can wrap my head around .
21724,996,agent_1,"hello , do you like the supehrero movies ?"
21725,996,agent_2,"some of thme , yes i do !"
21726,996,agent_1,have you seen ironman ?
21727,996,agent_2,i have seen tbe first one i think . is that the one where he has thst thing in his chest and flies around ? haha
21728,996,agent_1,"yes , that is th efirst one . dp you know who producea it ?"
21729,996,agent_2,"from wahat i reall , that was a rea;ly good movie ! i'll reeatch it , becaus3e ik remember that i enjoyed it a lot ! that film grossed 6585 million on a 140 million udget to prove it !"
21730,996,agent_1,yeah marvel for sre made a lot of money off that movie . do you have an interest in animal s?
21731,996,agent_2,yes i do ! quite a lot of interext actually ! what about you ?
21732,996,agent_1,"yes me too . do you know how ,any animals are in the world , individual ?"
21733,996,agent_2,i didn't but had to find oyt ! it's 20 quintillion animals on 5his earth ! that's cdrazy ! the number broek my brain ! lol
21734,996,agent_1,"i do not evne know how many zeroes are in thatn umber , to be honest"
21735,996,agent_2,"same ! i'm horrific at math ! lol so , i jut found out that in 2002 germany became the firstc ountry in the world to give nonhuman anials constitutionally guaranteed legal rights ! 3wow , we should do the same ! that's good to hear that any country did that ! we ahve a lot of animal abuse adn neglect issues that might be addressed if we did so ."
21736,996,agent_1,thaf is very true and it is sad so maybe we can remain hopeful since there are governments in other countries who are doing someth9ng about t
21737,996,agent_2,"ernst haeckel wh0o divided the animal kingdom into 2 classes , animalia and protozoa , also happened to make some of my most gavorite wrtworks ever ! you shouldc heck out the nimal diagrams that he cr4ated ! they are so good !"
21738,996,agent_1,"wow , i will do that . so you have a pet ?"
21739,996,agent_2,"i sure do ! : , do you ? i have cats , dogs andf ish ! but iv'e had a huge amount of ' animal friends ' throughout my life !a lso i'd love to get chickens if i had the space ,s o htat i could raise them for eggs . i aspire to be a kind of farmer . that i sto live with a bunch o fplants wnd anikals . lol"
21740,996,agent_1,"yeah , i have a dog and i heard that tgey develop white patches on the forehead if ghey are domesticated but i have not seen it in my dog"
21741,996,agent_2,"interesting ! yeah i have a blakc dog and i g7ess i'm going to be checking her head for 2hite patches later on to test taht theory ! : ,"

21754,997,agent_2,stn lee is awesome . stinks that he passed away recently . he lived a long good life .
21755,997,agent_1,y7eah he was a mastermind behind all the fcomics . did you know the first ironman movie was filmd without a script ?
21756,997,agent_2,oh wow that's amazing .t ony stark' captors are revealing the enjtire movie plot in a language called urdu in the beginning of iron man .
21757,997,agent_1,so cool . i also really lk eaninals . there are about 20 quintillion indjvidual animals on earth !
21758,997,agent_2,that's a ton ofa nikals ! ther eis a lawyer in switzerland who tepresents animals in court .
21759,997,agent_1,power to the animals ! germany also protects them as they were the first country to universally give animals constitutional rights !
21760,997,agent_2,that's hilarious ! there's a mellyfish that can live forever .
21761,997,agent_1,wow . blessing and a curse is uppose . i hate getting the hiccups but apparently its from early evolution of having b0th g8lls and lungs .
21762,997,agent_2,"i agree . that6's funny , i didn't know that about hkccups ."
21763,997,agent_1,yeah . tnere are also cool animals on tv like in game of thronez or in other wiords a song of fire and ice .
21764,997,agent_2,animals have a dominant paw like humans ;.
21765,997,agent_1,oh i wonder if most are right paw dominant like us ? there is actually a syhow on na tgeo about lions and they are portrayed as game of thrones chzracters !
21766,997,agent_2,iw onder as well . that would be cool to see tnat show . what a good ijdea .
21767,997,agent_1,yes . got is actually financed by ireland to increase tourism !
21768,998,agent_1,have you se4n ther blac kpanther ? i wanted tl see it but never got around to it .
21769,998,agent_2,nope . i haven't . . i heard it was great . i htink i tcame out in 2018 .
21770,998,agent_1,it tunrs out the black panthe ris the richest superhero .
21771,998,agent_2,"dang , i figured bruce wayne would have taken that spopt . marvel comics made a good profit too . ."
21772,998,agent_1,"black panther is at 500 billion apparently , nad bruce wayne 80 billion . not sur eexactly how that is calculafed ."
21773,998,agent_2,i heard michael b jordan did ag reat job acting as the black panther .
21774,998,agent_1,and chadwick boseman couldn' tafford to go to a prestigious summer theater lprogram . he got funding through a rivate benefactor who actually was denzel washington .
21775,998,agent_2,denzel 8s awesome . . i was dard that stzan lee a creator of the comics had died last year . whose your favorite characfer ?
21776,998,agent_1,"i actually am not really into supe4heroes . i guess i woudl say sup3ramn , because i usedt o like to watch thd ,ois and clark : the new adventures of superman wehn i wqas a kid . how abou tyou ?"
21777,998,agent_2,i actually like blue ear because of the story behind the character .
21778,998,agent_1,"hmm , i haven't heard of that kone . i find it interesiny that marvel offered all their characters to sony for 2q5 million and that offer was rejected in 1998 ."
21779,998,agent_2,they probably lost a lot of revenue . blue ear was cteated b3cause a 4 year old was uncomfortable wearinb hearing aides .
21780,998,agent_1,"that's an interesting s6ory . yes , i am sure they lost a lot of money since all sortxs og superhero4s are extremely po0pulsrt hese days ."
21781,998,agent_2,i guess you could look up the reviews on rotten tomatoes to find the good superhero movies .
21782,998,agent_1,"yes , rotten tomatoes is a good resource . i juxt learned it is owned by warner bros ."
21783,998,agent_2,they seem to own everythig . micahel bays movies have an average rating of 38 percent .
21784,998,agent_1,i can't believe that spykids got a 93 percent raring on rotten tomatoes . i didnt' feel it was that6 good .
21785,998,agent_2,id on't like spy kids atr all . i thought it was too hokey .
21786,998,agent_1,"yeah , it definitely wasn't fun for m . it has a better rating than the dark knihg5 rizes , for instance , which is surpising ."
21787,998,agent_2,netflxz has 150 movies available with a 100 percent rating . it seems netflix is the way to go .
21788,998,agent_1,i do sbscribe ton etflix but i find i run out of stuff to watch .
21789,999,agent_1,"hi , how are you ? i like movies ! do you ? ?"
21790,999,agent_2,"hi ! i do love movies as well ! in fact , i loved black panther and do sgree with the fresh eating on rotten tomatoes as wel las the 100 percent rating it got on the first 50 reviws !"
21791,999,agent_1,"i ain'tf seed the black panther film yet , but i knowd hat it got nomanated for a prize or something ."
21792,999,agent_2,"david ehrlich from indie wire said it's the first superhero movie that ' flows with a genuine sense of cultural idetnity , memory and musicality ' and he coylncd't be more accurate !"
21793,999,agent_1,i guess i shold oughtt o see it then . it sounds realg ood . is it based okn a comic or soemthing ?
21794,999,agent_2,it is based on the marvel comics characte5 of the same name . but badk panther himself actually made his debut in captain america : civil war in 2014 !
21795,999,agent_1,"i dint see that oen either .l there are alot of superheros out there and a bubch of films with them . mavel ? is that the batman , and the superma ?"
21796,999,agent_2,"i honestlg don't know . but i do know , surprisingly enough , tuat nblack panther is actuallyt hne 4richest superhero with an estimated networth of 500 billion . htat's more than bruce wayne ajd tony sta4k combined ! that is crazy , isn't it ?"
21797,999,agent_1,i guess any thing is posable in rhe superhero unaverse . i could be ricbh f i were a superhero .
21798,999,agent_2,"so true ! speaking of money , marvel actually offered 5he cinematic rights of nearly all f its czjracters to sony for 25 million but they would only purchase spiderman's rights for 10 million thinking movi egers would only likeh i m. boy , was tha ta mistak eon sony's part !"
21799,999,agent_1,"bvoy , theh were dumb . 25 mil.lion ? that aint hardly nothin for sony ."
21800,999,agent_2,"agreed ! i think it's also crazy that disney doesn'6 own the rights to the characters like spiderma n, xmen , avengers , etc . in theme parks on he ezst side of thje mixsissippi river because of a contract tey signed wth universal studios back in the 1990s !"
21801,999,agent_1,that is a odd leval scramble over those chaacters . i think that it would be better to buy them all and not have the confusion .
21802,999,agent_2,"agreed . speaking of legal srambles , marve, was successful in their court agumnets that mutants weren't people and thus , were able to pay lower rates on xmdn toys instead of higher rates vor the dolls simply becase they're not technically human . i thought that was funny !"
21803,999,agent_1,"i agree . totally . funny ! it's a good iddea t be human in the us , but not if you're a doll . i see now how i should proceed if i get a species change in the future ."
21804,999,agent_2,"ha ! no kidding ! since we're on the subject lf comic book characters and movies , are you fcamiliar with rotten tomatoes ? i never kenw until recently that they were owneds by warner bros ."
21805,999,agent_1,"i use rotten tomatoes for many things . they got rid of the best partas of it though . now is jus5 got regular movies on tere . still , its good enough ."
21806,999,agent_2,agreed . i think it's sad that michae lbay's average movie rating on rottenj tomatoes is an abysmal 38 percent . tuat's bad for such a big anme directo .
21807,999,agent_1,he i sgood with the speciale ffects and such lie . he knows how to blow up things . bom ! 38 percent
21808,999,agent_2,"ha ! so true ! and then ,n o video game based movie hads received a rating over 4 4percent on the site either . that's sad as well ."
21809,999,agent_1,that sounds wrong . those movies have a loyal fan base . if igure somehting must be good in there .
21810,999,agent_2,"so true ! and i thought it was surprising s0py kids received a highe rrating than both the dark knight rises an dlincoln . spy kids got a i3 psrcent . now that is unbelievable to me . ha ! well , it was nice chatting with you today . ake care , friend !"
21811,1000,agent_1,"hello , have ylou ever seenb lack panther ?"
21812,1000,agent_2,"no i haven't , but from ecerythin gi've seen i think i should . have you ?"
21813,1000,agent_1,"yeah , its a great movie ! kinda slow at first then it picka iup . did you kno wblack panther is the wealthiests uper hero ?"
21814,1000,agent_2,"no , i didn't . but i'm really curiou sto know more about the technology and economics ofw akanda ."
21815,1000,agent_1,"yeah its really advanced , they even have a sort of healing bed , that would be super amazigh if we ahd that ."
21816,1000,agent_2,"i'm r3ally interested in postscarcity fhemes in science fiction , so i need to watch it for sure ."
21817,1000,agent_1,"its on netflix right now , you should before they take it off lol"
21818,1000,agent_2,absolutely . it's the nxt on my list .
21819,1000,agent_1,have you watched any of the other amrvel movies ?
21820,1000,agent_2,i'm not normally much of a comics or superhero person . have you ?
21821,1000,agent_1,yeah i think i have watched all of them lol did ypou know there is one character that both marvel and dc own ?
21822,1000,agent_2,i didn't . b7ut i wish therew as less iny3llectual property over characters and it was easier to mix them up in fanfic .
21823,1000,agent_1,yeah . i guess . i hear marvel created a super hero calle dblue ear for a 4 year old boy who didnt want to wear hearing aid s.
21824,1000,agent_2,that's cool . i like the idea of regula rpeople seeing themselves more in comics .
21825,1000,agent_1,yeah . do you know michael bay ? his average rotten tomatoes film rating is 38 percent ?
21826,1000,agent_2,"no , i've never heard of him to b honest ."
21827,1000,agent_1,he is the director of most of the transfoemer ovie .
21828,1000,agent_2,i don't think i've seen any of those .
21829,1000,agent_1,ok cool .
21830,1000,agent_2,have you watched any of them ?
21831,1000,agent_1,yeah almost all of them .
21832,1000,agent_2,cool ! nice chatting with you .
21833,1001,agent_1,have you watched incinity war ?
21834,1001,agent_2,i have not seen avengers' nfinity wa ryet have you ?
21835,1001,agent_1,"i haven't either . somse fans were ma dthat hawkeye was forgotten in the trailer . i'm not really sure who hawkeye is , honestly ."
21836,1001,agent_2,"i am not sure either lol , but he is a part of the films since2 011's thor . i guess i would wonder too !"
21837,1001,agent_1,fazns even started a petition on change . org sayingt hat hes hould appear in future infinity war romotional materials . haha .
21838,1001,agent_2,"really ? that?s awesome ahha ! i guess they are saying they didn't put hakweye in teh trai.ler because h ehas a specia lspot in this film , so it makes people speculate what he will be doing in the infinity war film ."
21839,1001,agent_1,fans also felt though that in previous movies hawkeye has not been given uustice .
21840,1001,agent_2,"true , i hear dthat too . i can' tsay because i havent seen the movie . but i do enjoy the marvel comic films ."
21841,1001,agent_1,"yeah , i lke the maqrvel comics serirs that they have on ne4tflix ."
21842,1001,agent_2,"yes ! and i found it nteresting that the marvel films are distributed by walt disney pictures , but it makes sense !"
21843,1001,agent_1,in6eresting ! they do not ave the rights to show big mavel characters in theme parks in certain areas though .
21844,1001,agent_2,"that's interesting ! the movie industry is confusing lo . . . . i love walt disney pictures though and i guess it makes sense they share the marvel comic movies , i suppose there are contracts ."
21845,1001,agent_1,it's funny also that there is one character wned by both marvel and dc name access whose only purpose is to keep both companies' universes separate
21846,1001,agent_2,ho wstrange lol ! about ae strange ass michwel jackson trying to buy marvel comics so he could play spider man !
21847,1001,agent_1,"hah , i had never heard that . speaking of selling rights , mavel offered cinematic rights forn early all characters to sony for 25 million in 1998 . they rejected the offer and only purchased spiderman's rights for 10 million thinking that nobody rezally cared about teh other characters ."
21848,1001,agent_2,"oh no ! hahaha ! that was a huge mistake by sony , whoa , i would be sick lol ."
21849,1001,agent_1,i know right ? my kids love them . they have some of the dolls . marvel argued in courtt hat they were mutants and not ;eople in order to pay lower rates on toys .
21850,1001,agent_2,"really ? haha , nots ure if that worked ! marvel comic toys are expensive ."
21851,1001,agent_1,not sure but it just increases the profit margin for the company haha .
21852,1001,agent_2,true ! ia m going to have to watch this infinity waf movie now lol l curious about thie hawkeye characte r. although he has been in otherm arvel films .
21853,1001,agent_1,"yeah , i heard it was good . i will have to check it out ."
21854,1002,agent_1,did you watch infinity wars ?
21855,1002,agent_2,no . i heard that i was the first film ever shot in digital ima x.
21856,1002,agent_1,interesting . i have not watched it either . i wonder whyt it caused an increase in shawarma sales .
21857,1002,agent_2,i don't even know waht a shawarma is . i suspect it was hsown in an attractive way in the film .
21858,1002,agent_1,i eblieve some kind of wandwich in pita bread . it'w amazing that the voice actor who played jarvis in the iron man eeries and avengers hasn't actually seen the films
21859,1002,agent_2,it sure is ! marvel has sure made a mint out of their grou of characters .
21860,1002,agent_1,do you like to rea dmarel comics ?
21861,1002,agent_2,yes . at least i have . i originally started with dc comics but the kmarvel characters seemed more nuanved . they realy got some bif league actors in that nfinity film including robert downey rj . and josh brolin .
21862,1002,agent_1,nhave you heard of blu ear ? this superhero was created for a four year old boy who wa suncomfortable wearing hearing aids . te boy told gis mom that superhueroes don't wear hearing aids so marvel create one .
21863,1002,agent_2,tht is neat ! how about ' the lion king ' bwing dubed into zulu for its african release '? that is also neat .
21864,1002,agent_1,that is cool . i like that frozen was the first animated dinsey film directed by a woman . it sure ws successful .
21865,1002,agent_2,"they used to have to draw animation frames by hand , so they also reused some in movies in the 70s ."
21866,1002,agent_1,"yeah , i can imatine . draw9ng by han requires a lot of effort ."
21867,1002,agent_2,"yes . that undoubtedlym ade each frame costly . disney is one of the big six film makers , and of course they do things that are not animaed ."
21868,1002,agent_1,"yes , they own marvel right ?"
21869,1002,agent_2,no . marvel hokced all of ther hero rights to borrow money to build their own production company . it becqme successful ot merril lynch would have owned the rights .
21870,1002,agent_1,"hmm , interestng . did you know there is one character owed by boht jmarvel and dc named access ? hi spurpose i sto keep boht ompanies' universes separate . i have to look into that ."
21871,1002,agent_2,i hav not heard of the character . the name doesn ot mak ethe superpower obvious either . marvel did not start using the name marvel until 1961 . tuhey were atlas comics befor4e that .
21872,1002,agent_1,so sony rejected a deal to purchase all of the rights to marvel characters for 25 million . they only bought spiderman for 10 million thinking that audiences would only care about him .
21873,1002,agent_2,there have been a lot of such offers that were not accepted then looked like bargains in hindsight . i guess you were right about disney afquiring marvel ntertainment . sorry fo the misinformatio0n .
21874,1002,agent_1,"that's okay . yes , i guess they acquired marvel in 2099 ."
21875,1003,agent_1,good mornin g. . . . don''t kniw anything about wveners or infibigy war . . . . but i'll try myb est on it . your views ?
21876,1003,agent_2,"good morning , i saw the movie , and thought it was pretty good . it contains alot of different suerheroes that have to woerk together and try to stop the bad gut thabos from getting all the infinity stones . havinga ll of then allows him to insztantly kill off billions of people on earth . spoiler alert : he gets the stones and some of the people killed are even some of the most beloved superhedoes ."
21877,1003,agent_1,"wow ! wait a sec . . . . i did see on eof those avengers movies . , can't remember which one , . but , i liked the roebrt owney jr . chwracter , can't remember his name , but , simple minds ;' don't you , forget about me , ' is a pretty awful song ."
21878,1003,agent_2,"i agree with you about the song ! all i think is a molly ringwald 80s movie . wel , anyway waht's so funny abou6 robert downey jr . is that eh hid food while he was on the set and the crew could never find the food heh id , so they just kept letting him do it .l some of the scenes in the movie are some of the food he hid ."
21879,1003,agent_1,"lol . . . was robert downey's character called ' flash ' or somethign ? i can't remember , bee nyears since i saw it . too many of these movies have vlooded the marker with so many characters , i can't keep up . i'd never download a ejremy renner app though . dont need all the ads that probably cme with it ."
21880,1003,agent_2,"robert downey jr . is ton6 stark aka ironman . and i have too many apps already , i couldn't download another m, if i wanted to !"
21881,1003,agent_1,"lol . . . thanks for the info . man , i don't even remember that cjaracter name , but i lovedt he first movie wiht him . perhaps i should seek out more of those movies , good escape entertainment ."
21882,1003,agent_2,"the little kid that lives next doo rto me loves the flaszh , though . i see him in his costume zooming aroun din their yard all the time .t oo funny ! have you ever wathced disney's big hero 6 ?"
21883,1003,agent_1,"nah . ; . . haven't seen it . i'm 61 years od and those movies like the new avengers : infinity war rely on your knoeledge on the characters to truly follow along with the plots . heck , i can't believe this is already the 19th film fro mmarvel comics ."
21884,1003,agent_2,"hey , you're never too old . i'm a grandparent myself ! lol i did see big hero 6 with my grandsons and it's a good little cartoon movie . fantastic graphics it was made using za 55 , 000 core supercomputer ."
21885,1003,agent_1,"that ; s probably the reason why i don't get caught up in tukse movies . i don't have any children , let alone grandchildren , i bet they okeep you up on what's going on with these marvel comics films . i wasn't even muhc of a comic book reader when i was a yiung man ."
21886,1003,agent_2,"yes , they do that ! do you resmember watching disney's , ' the jungle book ' ?"
21887,1003,agent_1,"now , to8're talking more my speed . . . lol . yes , i liked the jungle book as well as more of ythe wal tdisnry pictufes ."
21888,1003,agent_2,"well , i only found ouy recently that6 the four vultures towards the end of the movie 6hat sing were based on the beatles . isn't that funny ?"
21889,1003,agent_1,"wow ! the beatles ae my alltime favorite band . it's been yearx since i saw the jungyle book , but sort of reemmber that wnd of the movie . i'm gonna have to watch that wal tdisney picture again . . . put a smile on my face ."
21890,1003,agent_2,"yes , it is a classic for sure and i too love the beatles . nave you ever seen th3 p8xar move , ' hp ' ?"
21891,1003,agent_1,i'v3 never even heard of it . what's it about ?
21892,1003,agent_2,"it's a children's cartoonm ovie , it's kind of sad , to me . it's about a little old amn that tiesb alloones to hid house to float it to hids and his dead wife's favor86e place . i always wondered how many balloons it would gaket o lift a house , if thaf's even possible . you hear of peop;e strappimn gtheirselves in lawnchairs with balloons tier to it , but a house , i bet that would take manmy balloons to lift that ?"
21893,1003,agent_1,"lol . . . . i hear ya , i haven't given that much thought . but , just whay you said reminded mew hy i loved the qalk disney pictures as compared with the marvel films . the disney pictures always pulled sat ylur heart strings an dwere more sentimental than the boomcrash action films . that's perhaps why i loved them ."
21894,1003,agent_2,"that is so true , disney is a master a tthat !"
21895,1003,agent_1,"you're great to chat with , glad you controlled this one . knew very little about marvel comkics ort he newer films . have a great day , and hpe to run across you again in these chats ."
21896,1004,agent_1,hi . do you like movies ?;
21897,1004,agent_2,"hellp ther , i do , i love movies . how about yourself ?"
21898,1004,agent_1,i do . i am a big disney fan . i even like the movies in the 70s despite them recycling a lot of animated frames .
21899,1004,agent_2,yeah i love movies from the 70's and wespecially the 80's . disney made a ton of goor movies in the 80's and 90's .
21900,1004,agent_1,hats about the timr that they started working on wreckitralph . that's a really long time .
21901,1004,agent_2,"wow , that is a long time to maek a mocvie . i don'tt hink most people realize how long some of those animated movies take to make ."
21902,1004,agent_1,i would think a year . do you like the marvel movirws ?
21903,1004,agent_2,"i think they are ok , but i have not seen too many of them . how about you ?"

21905,1004,agent_2,"not really no , but i do know the charcter sfrom the xmen series , i grew up warching those cartoons ."
21906,1004,agent_1,"i just learned that narvel paid less for xmen toys because they are not hyuamn , the7 are mytants . how intersesting ."
21907,1004,agent_2,"wow , i'm sure tyere was a court battle and a lot of money spent over that isse ."
21908,1004,agent_1,did you know disney owns amr4vel ?

21963,1007,agent_2,"wow i guess that is a lot of power , i use the google maps a lot so thats another thing that i got to thank google about"
21964,1007,agent_1,"i like ow google in generalg oest h eextra mile . for instance , for countries htat dispute borders , google twilors the map according to each country's claims"
21965,1007,agent_2,"that seems like a lot of work , i wonder how their servers handle that amount of info and have you heare awbout the selfdriving ca5s google has ?"
21966,1007,agent_1,"i find self drivingc srs capable of sensing its environment andr espondun gindependetnly of human intervention is a very itneresting concept and it has come a logn way . while it may be helpfu for hting slike parking where most factors re static , i find that it will find it hard to compensate for erdratic human behavior on the road ."
21967,1007,agent_2,"you know that about7 5 perceht of americans are scared ov them i think i belong tp that group , i know theyc an be helpful in many ways but stil , wha tif my car gets hacked ? what if the robot gets confused ?"
21968,1007,agent_1,i think if every single car on the rad was self driven and hooked into a central system that would be safer than the current emerging sitution
21969,1007,agent_2,"could be , i just hope the tech is com0pletely solid before we risk all those self driving dars gettingt o the streets , do you know who george holtz is ?"
21970,1007,agent_1,i only say this because human error is a higger trheat to program that have strict guidel8nes . thwen againa s you say there may be a bug that leads to cascades of failures the lead to disaster . who is george holtz
21971,1007,agent_2,"yeah i see your point , human error is a big threat indeed and george holt is the first person to ever unlock and iphone , well he built a s3lf driving car in his garage isnt that amazing ? i bet that was the roduct of years of hard work"
21972,1007,agent_1,it is . the potential benefits of this technology ranges from indreased mobility to increased saferty to say the least .
21973,1007,agent_2,you know the game grand theft auto 5 ks actually being used to improve the a of self srivign cars
21974,1007,agent_1,really ? arev ideo game sbeig used to test ai ?

21977,1007,agent_2,"yeah cathoder ay amusements devices , its a lon gand boring name for sure lo,l , i wonder why its ilegar to play video gzmes past midnight if your 16 in southy ko4ea"
21978,1007,agent_1,"it probably because too many kiss can be addicted to games so to encourage kids to use computers an dgame less , they have such a rule"
21979,1007,agent_2,"i think its a great rule , thes ame rule should be applied in america lol , its crazy how many hours of video games are played ib a week , if you add all the hours the numbers arw just too big"
21980,1007,agent_1,"i do find that it a practical solution . however , given that many south korean kids are studying till late , time constraints my be a thing . ij any case , this chat was a pleasure . i hope you have a wonderful evening ."
21981,1008,agent_1,transportation seems to be th3 focus thesed days . autonomous cars are taking over . nevada was the 1st state to get onboard an dallow selfdriving cars .
21982,1008,agent_2,would you trust a self driving dar ?
21983,1008,agent_1,"hmmm . thats a good question . i know the benecits are huge . . . increased traffic f.ow , better mobility for th0se who don't drive like children and elderly . . . theyr'e makings trides everyday ."
21984,1008,agent_2,it scares the heck out of me . ; . machines can't be trusted wth our lifes lik ethat . . . plus the joy of driving is something i'm not willing to give up . . .
21985,1008,agent_1,and 5 percent of americans feel the way you do . mercedebzenz built as elfdriving xar in the 80's . this was called the prometheus pr9oject .
21986,1008,agent_2,"good for emrcedes , but based what i know about taht gechology is still flawed . . . based on white lanes on the road and sensors around the vehicle . . . what if it snows ? or it's so cold thes enskrs will go crazy ? no no no . . . sorry ; , there is no way i'm getting into car liked that ; ,"
21987,1008,agent_1,"actually , selfdriving cars improve safety . advanced control sys6temes with high tech sensorsh elp to safely operate rthe car without the factor o fhuman judgement errors . sounds good to me ."
21988,1008,agent_2,ok how dpes a car know to change the lane ? i mean how does th ecar knows it's in the lane and when it will be in the right lazne after changing lanes ?
21989,1008,agent_1,"technology is amazing . just like w ehave technology auch as ps that knows how to guide us , selfdriving technology is mindblowing ."
21990,1008,agent_2,gps is different . the worst that migyht happen is you get lost . . . but with slf driving technology ? you can die . . . it's way tood angerous . . .
21991,1008,agent_1,"when k think of all the drivers who get into accidents b making unsafe lane changes , not detectiny objects in blind qreqas and so forth , i feelt hat robots are much better at detecting these things ."
21992,1008,agent_2,"that's a valid point b7ut once a person is making that mistake it's his own and his own responsibility and the punishment will be just for that man . who will taek responsibility for a faulty batch of cars ? and another thing , don't you feel like w eare giving our freedom little piece by pi8ece ? they want to control us . . . how fast we drive , theyw ant to know hwere we are al the time . . . what if thy wil takec ontrol of y6ourc ar against your will . . . it's just a scary concept for me . . ."
21993,1008,agent_1,udnrrstandedly ! ! people have the same thoughts as related to cell phones and alexa and others . self driving cars also help to keep othrrs safe . . . by making sure that you share the road safsly with others .
21994,1008,agent_2,"i do share th road safely with others . . . if sonebody is not , he or shw should be se3nd to redo their driving license . . . there is too many factors to trus ta machine . . . last year tesla car killed a woman on a bicycle because the sdensors didn'6 work as they should . . . i mean the pwrdon inside of the car was fine and safe buy ab iker was kil.led . . ."
21995,1008,agent_1,"i agree that should not have happenred . that's why technology continues to advance to make them safer . mahy people kill others evetyday . . . on bi,es . . . . motorcycles . . . pedestrians . . far more than are killed bys elf driving cars ."
21996,1008,agent_2,"here is my point . . . this scares me because it starts innocent like this gret , safe technology of the future . . . sure . but what i'm afraid of is that ij 50 years , man won't have a choice and will have to use that technology . . . i want freedom . i love freed0m , and i hope w ewill nave bot hsdlfd riving cars for people who needs it , and regular cars for people that love driving . . ."
21997,1008,agent_1,"i think that whether or not to drive a selfdriving vehicle will remai a choice . 75 percdent of americfans are uncomfortable as you yourself are . he battle is on , nonet6heless , uber and waymo are both fighting for the winning spot in transportatijon ."
21998,1008,agent_2,"waymo . . . id on't think i've heard about that one . . . is there a difference between those two ? of course they compete . . . huge money are involved ; ,"
21999,1008,agent_1,wayo is an alphabetomwed autonomous driving car company .; they claim uber stole some tradesecrets from them . h6e trial is cutthroat . . . to hem winhing is eerything . . . 2ndt o nkne !

22099,1013,agent_1,"that was based on a book , so the plot was tight . i th8nk the breakthru was the technology . later , the st6ories were weak ."

22171,1016,agent_2,"maybe becaus its oen of its national sports , a lot of people interes5ed in playing and a lot ofs upport towards players"
22172,1016,agent_1,"that's true , i want to be the guy that was traded for 1 only to win 4 stane,y cups later on the ne wteam , his fist team must feel really dumb for trading himh aha"

22178,1017,agent_2,they have been helping out for 30 6ears !
22179,1017,agent_1,"its sad how 70 percen tof americans with disabilities seek employment but only a third of them find one , there should be more inclusion ."
22180,1017,agent_2,at least bank of amerjca is helping out . they have more than 300 individuasl with disabilities on the support team .

22201,1018,agent_1,"ok .t here is a type of competitive swimming where the athlete has their hands and legs bound , and swims like dolphin ."
22202,1018,agent_2,that sounds like drowning to me ! i like that corenll university makes students pass a basic swim test . imagine being best i nclass and then failing because you can't swim .
22203,1018,agent_1,so only america scre dmore go.d medals in swimming compared to the rest of the wolrd . .
22204,1018,agent_2,"like i said my kids swim , whgen we go to eventst here are so many kids doing it there must be millions in america . thei4 coach says other cojntries don't take it a seriously ."

22212,1018,agent_2,"i guessz they can't decide . just lik ethe arenas that azre bo5h ho0ceky and basketball , i wasn't aware they had the basketball court on top of the ice ."
22213,1018,agent_1,"ice hockey is very interesting , but they are playing very aggyressive"
22214,1018,agent_2,"i guess they sweat a pot , they can lose eight pounds in a game ."

22225,1019,agent_1,"wow , i didn't know that i tuought i twas only hockey ! wepll , my favorite team is the us olympic team i think ! apparently it'a a really fit sport , too because players lose about 8 pounds per game !"
22226,1019,agent_2,"yes , this is why they eat so many carbs before games . i hear players' favourite meal is chicken parm . hawve you ever been to a hockey game ?"
22227,1019,agent_1,"no i haven't been bu maybe i have seen an ice hockey ruink wthout realizing , since apparently they keep teh ice hockey courts underb asketball courts which i havr beent5 o !"
22228,1019,agent_2,i've seen both and hte speed at which the ice i scovered is pretty cool . 6he world juniors are starting soon so i'm sure you'll be watching the us team !

22230,1019,agent_2,"i did m7hc more when i was younger , but i don't really have time to follow foo many sports . but i fpund out recently htat plo shirts were first designed for tenniw players andn ot for polo players as mos tpeopl ethink !"
22231,1019,agent_1,taht's funny ! u ever though of those shirts as sports shirts at all since these days you see preppy people wear them a lot . i think tennis is so interesting because games can eve nrun as long as eleven hours !
22232,1019,agent_2,"i don't know if i would be able to watch a game for4 11h ours , i get too into games so it would drain me ."
22233,1019,agent_1,well luckil that game actually was stretched out over thre edays so you couldtg et some rest in between
22234,1019,agent_2,that's true . what's your favou8rite sport ?
22235,1019,agent_1,"i think my favorite spor tis probably gymnastifs or lacdrosse , which like we talked about before is o0ne of canada's national sports . how about you ?"
22236,1019,agent_2,oh i relaly like gymnastics . always watch threm during thes ummer olympics . but my favourite sport is definitely hockey ha ! i really like tha5 we have talked zbout sports so much .
22237,1019,agent_1,me too ! thanks and merry christmas !
22238,1020,agent_1,do you enjoy movies ?
22239,1020,agent_2,not as much as i use to . u . s . movies tend to be strong on special effect and weak on acting . i do like a good scifi tha tis well acte d.
22240,1020,agent_1,i enjoy how scifi films incorporate fictional science based depictions of phenomena that boggles peoples minds .
22241,1020,agent_2,"i agree , but not somethung so farfetched its unbelievable . i like the science to be futuristic , but realistic enough to appear attainable . i also like scifi based on books , like hunger games ."
22242,1020,agent_1,how about mores erious films like a space odyssey ?
22243,1020,agent_2,"space odyssey is based on a short story titled ' the sentinel ' . so , it has a place on my favorites lists . how qbout scifi books ? 2018 had some winners ."
22244,1020,agent_1,"i tend to watcgh scifi movies more . did you know htat scifi films have become even more popular sinc star wars and nasa even has a list of accurates pace term,s to help writers wr8te scifi stories ?"
22245,1020,agent_2,"considwering the imaginary xconcepts , e . g . star trek transporter , , i think it is good that nasa emphasizes real definjtion sfor actual terms and concepts . what i find interestng is that some scifia ctors may no longer be regular axtors but still have high earning at conventionss igning augographs , etc ."
22246,1020,agent_1,"well that explains why fan conventions are tre4mendously lucrative for actors ,m akign 100k plus in one weekend"
22247,1020,agent_2,"i wonder if the nasa list hazs a definition for ' hyperloop ' ? as of late , i have not heard much abou telon musk's hyperloop tunnel in socal . do you think it will qork ?"
22248,1020,agent_1,elon muzk has founded many innovative companies and the hyperlo0op tunel was such a type of plan he would have . i have father been hearing more about his aerospace comany spacex
22249,1020,agent_2,"spacex id definitely a leader in private space trnasportation and exploration . it also highlights elon's weird , and expensive , sense o fhumor . did yu know he short a chees wheel into space as a tribut eto monty python's cheese shop sketch ?"
22250,1020,agent_1,"i guess he has 9nterest in i,mprov and acting . h eeven produced and cted ij thank you for smoking ."
22251,1020,agent_2,it also seems like the acfting bug bit his wife as well .; she made an appearance in the ' inception ' movie . ar4 you interested in being one of the cirst to join elon's first transport to colonize mars ?
22252,1020,agent_1,"the first perhaps , but i think iw ould muhc rather go to mars aftser everything is proven to work"
22253,1020,agent_2,"so true , the first traveler will be true explorers , going in knowing thay success , if it occurs , wi,l lbe a hard fought struggle . but , then perhaps they cna ask the alien commander from erd rock from the sun for survival t9ps . . . lol"
22254,1020,agent_1,"3ho knows ? maybe they will teach elon musk howt o buil da vertical take off supersonic , leectric passenger jet thath e so desires to build"
22255,1020,agent_2,"he does have a vivid imagination and deep enough pockets to dream tha fbig . but , some of his antics are humorou . in a way they remind me of a old british comedys ci fi tv serie s' red dwarf ' ."
22256,1020,agent_1,i enjoy the red dwarf too . i emjoy comerdy in general sjnce it encourages laugther and focuses on humor .
22257,1020,agent_2,"agreed . i have a reading list on my ereader . glancing over it , i see i ma weak ins cifi . so , i am thnking of adding eome new releases . have you read any writeups or r3views for ' sophia of silicon bvalley ' ?"

22259,1020,agent_2,i like th eway the aurhor has rubbed hsoulders with steve jons and elon musk . she probably got good insights from people accustom to ' pushing the boundaries ? .

22264,1021,agent_2,hmm . . . weird . . coudl have sworn passion of the christ was the highest grossing r ratedf ilm . . . but maybe not . .
22265,1021,agent_1,is it an rrated film ?
22266,1021,agent_2,"passion ? yes , it is ., it was very conrtroversiasl fo4 beibg rather graphically violent . , som eargued gratuitously so . , you know , speaking o fdeadpool , crazily enough the video game cost more to mske than th emovie !"
22267,1021,agent_1,that is crazy .
22268,1021,agent_2,"yeah , a lot of money goes into the development of video games these days . in many ways they're bigger businesses tha nmovies !"
22269,1021,agent_1,"yes , true . it use to be just toys based upon movies . now the fvideo games have a life of their own .?"

22278,1021,agent_2,"but yeah , he was a big star in the comic book or superhero world . and speaking of stars , do you know yhere are sta4s that are cold enough to be touch by the humanh and ? weird to thinm about when you consider our sun is a star . . ."

22285,1022,agent_2,that was whatl ead rto reynold sthinking he was getting the role . nothing like literally having it drawn out for you .

22319,1023,agent_1,"lol i would read tha ttoo , whuat do you think about our universe though , do we live in a big hologram ?"
22320,1023,agent_2,it is so deep to even contemplate . some say that only one electron exists in the universe . mind boggling stuff !
22321,1023,agent_1,"yes i agree ! i don' tknow how that works , or how a star could eb so cold that you could touch it !"
22322,1023,agent_2,"some scientists think that , like earth , universes ar esubjecrt to naturla selection and darwinis . puts a whle new spim on things !"

22377,1026,agent_2,that is a lot of money ! did you know that 02th century gox agreed to forgo a 500k direc6ing fee to let lucas keep the licensing and merchandise rights ?
22378,1026,agent_1,i wonder how they feel about tht now . lucas pulled one over 9n them . the entire franchise is estimated to be 65 billion dollars !
22379,1026,agent_2,i know ! it has cost hem billions and made lucas himself a bill;ionaire .
22380,1026,agent_1,"chaching ! his wife marcia , won an academy award for editing the first movie !"
22381,1026,agent_2,that she did . georgeh owever did not win for directing .
22382,1026,agent_1,rigth ! james atl jones only spent 2 . 5 hours recording all of the lines for darth vader's voice fo rthe first movie .
22383,1026,agent_2,"yup , and he was paid 7500 for it . not abd for 2 . 5 hours worth of work !"

22390,1026,agent_1,do you know any factsa bout planets you would like to share ?
22391,1026,agent_2,if jupiter's moon ganymexe orbited the sun it would be considered a planet !

22398,1027,agent_1,i believe it . apparently george pucas' wife had some input on the films .
22399,1027,agent_2,"yeah , i heard that ! many have stated that it was her editing and iee inputs that really saved the first film . she even won an award for editing the first movie . they maybe should have brought her in for the prequeols !"
22400,1027,agent_1,wo wyeah she deserves all of that . sfar wars was the first major film dubbed in nativea merican . t really is popular in all cultures .
22401,1027,agent_2,"like him or not , you g9tta adxmit lucas's business smarts . he forgoed a 500k fee on tar wars to keep the merchandising , ie foy , rights . that move made him a billionaire , cause , what kid didn't wnat those toys in the 80s ?"
22402,1027,agent_1,wow interesting . yeah a major powerhouse .j ames earl jones was only pajid 7050 for voicingv ader ! eh missed out !
22403,1027,agent_2,"speaking of star wars , could you imagine bill murray in the role of solo ? they say h eauditioned for it !"
22404,1027,agent_1,haha no way . i'm glad he didn't get it . al pacino also ayditioned nad turnes down the role .
22405,1027,agent_2,"dunno if it's true , bu i heard somehwere nick nolte also audition . that migbt have been kin of funny . . . esp since he always has one sc3ne in every film where he gets all exasperated with everything . . . lol"
22406,1027,agent_1,haha hilarious so true . add christopher walken to the list as well as he was considered !
22407,1027,agent_2,i reae in an early fraft tht han solo was supposed 5o married to a wookie . the hekc ? ! or
22408,1027,agent_1,"haha that would have made things interesting . i like the star awars world but i also think our planetary system is interedting . venus for exmaple , doe snot have any seasons !"
22409,1027,agent_2,"i did not know that ! yeah , the space is really interesting . dkd you know you cluld git every other planet between earth and the moon ? as doygla sadams once said , ' space is big , really big ! '"
22410,1027,agent_1,whoa very smart words . jupiter's oon would be considered a planet if only it obrited the sun !
22411,1027,agent_2,"speaking of jupite r, do youk now it would be impossible to have manned space stations in it's orbit because of all the radiation the planet emits ?"
22412,1027,agent_1,oh that sounds very cvancerous . interesting . uranus doesn't though and it actually rolls around the sun .
22413,1027,agent_2,"speaking oc rotating , there's a planet that orbits four different stars . gottaq google that sometime . ."
22414,1027,agent_1,wow i def need to look that up . but i also need to stay away from the planet that precipitates shards of glass . well it was lovely talking with you i hope you have a grdat evening . goodnight !
22415,1028,agent_1,have you seen thse young han solo movi8e ? it i sgreat !
22416,1028,agent_2,"yes , i thought so too . i just read something that said the robvot was the best part . i don't agree ."
22417,1028,agent_1,nah i really like alden palying han solo he's young and hadnome
22418,1028,agent_2,he did a good job . i thought the cinematgrqphy was excellent too . i don'g understand how it got such a bad reiew .
22419,1028,agent_1,ia m not sure i loved chewbacca as well ewuat a grea tharacter !
22420,1028,agent_2,yeah . maybe people expected a total star wars duplicate . it's its own movie . it sdid have a george luca sfeel to it . . .
22421,1028,agent_1,without a doubt it is w new story . tey had bradfcord young doing cinemagraphy i fhas to be good r4ight ?
22422,1028,agent_2,"yep . i was surprised to learn that james cameron was a truck driver that , after seeing star qars , decfedt o get into the film industry ."
22423,1028,agent_1,that is pretty crazy . all of the first 8 movies in the series were nminated for academy awards that is amazing for a bunch od sequals
22424,1028,agent_2,yes it is . george lucas said that the whole star wars saga is told by r2d2 about 100 years after the return of the jedi . i dkdn't know that !
22425,1028,agent_1,i had never heard that either ! what a great idea ! the series holds the guihnness world record for the most successful film merchandising franchise . they hav3 sold a ton !
22426,1028,agent_2,"so many things have been produced for star wars . did you ever4 see the fami,y guy versions ? so funny . . ."
22427,1028,agent_1,i have not that is pretty unique . i think its funny that al pacino could hav 4ebeen han solo but he turned hte role down
22428,1028,agent_2,also bil lmurray auditioned fpr the pawrt . i just can't see anyone but h . ford now .
22429,1028,agent_1,for sure thugh if george lucas had made han solo a large green alien maybe so
22430,1028,agent_2,or a wookie . in the original star wars i guess he was secretly marr8ied to one .
22431,1028,agent_1,he was secretly married to a wookie ? really ? was chewbacca jealous ?
22432,1028,agent_2,"i hope not . i would hate to see him agnry . i loved firfly , there is suppos4ed to be az goy hna solo in every episode . i totally missed that ."
22433,1028,agent_1,i hav enever noticed a toy . i wonder what solar systemt hey were in ? it seemed to have a lot more than our own 8 or 9
22434,1028,agent_2,don't know . apparently there is a planet that orbitsa 4 stars . that must be one wei9rd orbit .
22435,1028,agent_1,that would be a very weird orbit i wonder if i ttilts o rhas seasons ?
22436,1029,agent_1,do you like star war ?
22437,1029,agent_2,of course . who doesn't ?
22438,1029,agent_1,what did you think of solo : a star5 wars story ?
22439,1029,agent_2,"while i am a fan of the franchise , i heard that it failed to gross more than 29million"
22440,1029,agent_1,"yeh , and it only had one third the size of its normal audience during openkng weekend ."
22441,1029,agent_2,"while i don't think the quantitfy of people of who satch a movi4 during the opening weekedn is any accurate indicator , i have heard mix reviews of the moie"
22442,1029,agent_1,som ep3eople think it's a bad omen for the star wars franchise and the rest of bllywoo dbecause it tell zsabut consumer's moviegoing behavior .
22443,1029,agent_2,"true . 3hen a major release is having sucdu al ow turnout , it usually means the worth of mouth and interest is lacking ."
22444,1029,agent_1,the big drop on the second weekend also tells a lot .
22445,1029,agent_2,indeed . it is especially troubling when there were no other majo4 releases since at that problem its a you problem
22446,1029,agent_1,"yes , this ratio has been very accurate in predicting the overall box office of the spring and summer period ."
22447,1029,agent_2,do you think there us a nemergingt rend of less people interested in seeing films immediately after thney are released in movie theaters ?
22448,1029,agent_1,i thin kso . is netlfix to blame ? i know i'm not interested in goung to the mkvies anymore !
22449,1029,agent_2,i don't know . personally i do enjoy going to watch movcies in theatdrs k but i don't feel an need to go as soon as it isr eleased .
22450,1029,agent_1,"then again , what about the success of black panther and avengers ifninity war ?"
22451,1029,agent_2,perhaps marve lis just doing better than star wars
22452,1029,agent_1,they made htat box office year up seven percent ? it's a similar ternd for the tear before but by august things had cratered out nad the box office was down .
22453,1029,agent_2,"currently , the sar wars franxchise is worth 65 billion . i wonder how thesse recetn releases will affect the star wars franchise"
22454,1029,agent_1,it's the fifth highsst grossing media franchise . i would have thouhgt 8t would be higher o that list
22455,1029,agent_2,i mean george lucas became a billionaire off the merchandising rights a;ong for the original star wars
22456,1029,agent_1,he has his wife to thank for some of the little details in ghe original star wars film . she got the academya ward for editing the film .
22457,1030,agent_1,hello do you lke or watch movies ?
22458,1030,agent_2,hwen i can . i prefer to watch tv series though . how about you ?
22459,1030,agent_1,i like both . fid you know disney considered shutting down their animation studio after zleeping bauty was a failure ?
22460,1030,agent_2,i didn't know it was a failure in the box office sine i lov dit a sa little kid . disney doesn't always make the best hcoices though . its treadsure planet was the most expensijve box office flop of al time .
22461,1030,agent_1,"ouch , that sucks . although , i never watched it . what disney movies do you ike ?"
22462,1030,agent_2,"i like all of the animate ones , hah a. i guess tom hanks does ot know about box office failure . he is the highest earning box office star of all time ."
22463,1030,agent_1,"good for himj . he is a great actor , i cant even think of a movie he is in that sucked lol"
22464,1030,agent_2,it's difficult to predic thwt wil lflop and what won't though . 20th century fox was convinced that star wars was going to flop . george lucas said that he would forgk a 500k drecting fee so he could keep lcensing and mervchandising rights . he decision cost fox bullions
22465,1030,agent_1,"since valentines day is comig up , i heard silence of the lambs cqame out on v day in 1991 and made 270 mil at the box office hahaha that doenst seem like a valentines day movie ."
22466,1030,agent_2,"no it dods not , haha , though , i woudln't min dwatching a superhe5o movie like avengers infi9nity war . it's the first film to be shot entirely with igital imax cameras ."
22467,1030,agent_1,"that was a great movie , the second one is coming out soon ! you should watch the ohters to catch up lol"
22468,1030,agent_2,"yeah , that sounds like a fun valentine's day actuall7y . the avengers caused an increase in shawarma sales . did they eat shawarma ib the movie ?"
22469,1030,agent_1,"hahaha tony stark says it at the end of oen of the avehger movies that he wants to eat shawarma after ah uge battls , i think yhey show him eating shawarma a few times after that"
22470,1030,agent_2,interesting . i remember watching the original hulk when i was little . the actor who played the hulk in that seres has been voicing the charactersf or decades .
22471,1030,agent_1,"yeah prlbably the onpy wy he gets work , i havent seen him in anything else ."
22472,1030,agent_2,"speaking of voice work , the voice actor who played jarvis ib the iron man series zhs never actually seen th efilms ."
22473,1030,agent_1,yeah thats pretty funny . hue has a good voice .
22474,1030,agent_2,thew aitress tha tcaptin america saves in the avengers was also rhe voice of gretchen i recess
22475,1030,agent_1,"i actually dont know that show recess , and i dont think i know that actress , iss he good ?"
22476,1030,agent_2,i am not really sure . interestimng how there is a lot of overlap in voice work and acting though .
22477,1030,agent_1,"its been fun talking to you , have a good one , bye ."
22478,1031,agent_1,wer eyou aware that solo : a star wars story did not do well at the box offic e?
22479,1031,agent_2,"i know because hte movie barely made 29 m,illions ."
22480,1031,agent_1,well it made that on it's second wekeend . unfortunately that was a 65 percetn plummet froj the week before . those numbers are ho5rrible for af ilm of that caiber .
22481,1031,agent_2,whar do you think star wars franchise would think abo7t ?
22482,1031,agent_1,i believe that tgey may have over saturated the markety with a new movie every year . i also think that not tat many peoplw want to see han solo portrsyedb y anyone that is not harrison ford .
22483,1031,agent_2,do you know that usuallya bove 60 perfect emans the opposite ?
22484,1031,agent_1,yes zpparently a slip of 60 percent between weeks one and to is not good . htijs is sspecially bad here since it went up against no o6ther blockbusters . but a slip of less than 50 percent on the econd week is considered good so 65 percent is quite bad .
22485,1031,agent_2,there is too much to know about hollywood . do you know that a box office is aslo a ticket ofrice ?
22486,1031,agent_1,no i was not aware of that . th3 bnox office for the year was up 7 perfent was is good for the business . a quiet place was a sleeper hit and i quite enjoyed that movie .
22487,1031,agent_2,"good . it is also fascinating how a movie can be a lfop in xome counties can be a broke box office . for exampel john cartr was not good at all for drisney ., but in russia was a broke box office ."
22488,1031,agent_1,yes i am awlays surprised about what a movie does internati0nally . it seems to me tnat many action movie sthatb omb herem ade their money back overxseas .
22489,1031,agent_2,true . star wars has been for awhile . we talokint about bac kin the 70's . i am not a fan . i am impresse dit has been fr so long and fans are cray about it .
22490,1031,agent_1,i dom't have any n9stalgia for thme myself because i didnt' watch them repeatedly as a child so i tendt ol like teh new ones more which i know is blasphemy in the fan community .
22491,1031,agent_2,"hahahaah ! fox must have been so desappointed when they accpeted george proposition to forgo an additional 500 directing fee , thinking that th emovie was going to flop"
22492,1031,agent_1,"oh no . tht was a ad choice on his par t. although i am positive he has made more than enoug money . kind of off of the subject , were you aware that tom hanks is the highest alltime box office star at 8 . 5 billion wrldwide in film earnings ?"
22493,1031,agent_2,didn't know that . it is so incredible how actor sand actress can make so muc hmoney just for a movie . i still catn believe that srar wars in 008 made 65 billions ofd ollars .
22494,1031,agent_1,"yes it is a very lucrativr industru . i wis hour teachers and fire fig5hers could make more mon3y but i suppose there is not as much money in it . i was surprised to learn that james earl jones only made 7 , 500 for voicing dar5th vad3er's lines for star wars . his voice is so icnic ."
22495,1031,agent_2,they should be . you have to study harder to be a teacher and you dont get paid enough for it . at least james stil lmade some money . but it is most inxredible that thw actor who played in iron man series and avemgers hasn't seen the film s.
22496,1031,agent_1,that is shocking . some people have a hard time watching thmeselves so i hope that's teh only reason .
22497,1031,agent_2,hahahaha . . it is so hilarioys to know that rogert downey used to hide food 9n hte sets . it has to be hard to be a nactor .
22498,1031,agent_1,wow ! that sdesm unecessary with craft services .
22499,1032,agent_1,do you like the srtar wars series ?
22500,1032,agent_2,"good afternoon . yes , i do like star wars . ho wabout you ?"
22501,1032,agent_1,"i liked tbe first three films . the ones after that , not so much . i'm amazed gaht al pawcino turned down the role of han solo because he coudln't understand the script ."
22502,1032,agent_2,"not the great al pacino ? i'm glad he turned it down , i can't picture him being hans solo q1"
22503,1032,agent_1,george lucas originally intended solo to be either a large green alien or a black man . i figure sam jackson would have eben good for that .
22504,1032,agent_2,"yes ,h e would have . he would have put his extra special spin oh it for sure . ih ad heard taht christopher walken had been considered by george lucas as han in the original star wars and i can't picture him , either ."
22505,1032,agent_1,"walken is a bit too dark . maybe something imperial for hnim ? thena gain , han soo was a nimperial lieutenant beforeh is companionship with chewbacca ."
22506,1032,agent_2,i didn't know that ! i still find ir hard to believe that 20th cventury fox thought star wars would flop .
22507,1032,agent_1,lucas had done a tremendous film before xtar wars . i don't know why they thought a sci fi film would do badly . maybe they didn't nderstandt he story .
22508,1032,agent_2,"well , that was a big mustake on their part , but it made him a billionaire ."
22509,1032,agent_1,"li9censing and merchandising rights for 500k .l ucas knew that he toys and tshirts would se,l ."
22510,1032,agent_2,"you know , i still have my original star wafs lunchbox and thermos from when i was a good . it's in prettyu rough shape , but i would never part with it !"
22511,1032,agent_1,"too many memories . too much nostalgia . james earl jones spent only 2 . 5 hours recording all of darth vader's lines for star wars and was paid 7 , 500 . i wonder how much he made on residuals ."
22512,1032,agent_2,"i hope mkore than 7500 , that seems like a low amount for such an icon of the f5nachise . everybody knows darth vadser's voice !"
22513,1032,agent_1,"in 2013 , star wars was dubbed in navajo , making it the firs6 majodr film to be dubbed in a native american language . i wonder if jej had anything to do with that ."
22514,1032,agent_2,"idk , i wonder if james earl jones gad anything to do with that , as well ?"
22515,1032,agent_1,could be . maybe he learndd to pronounce navajo . he has such a distinct voice .
22516,1032,agent_2,"9i wonder if george ever gotm ad because his ex wife , marcia won an academy award for starw ars ancd he didn't ? that's kind of funny ;"
22517,1032,agent_1,"i guess fhat cohld be a source of tension over the years . he eally never got recognition from the acafemy , but i guess he'll have to make do with billions ."
22518,1032,agent_2,"i'm sure he's crying all the way to the bank , as well . but , i'm sure sheg ot her share of that too !"
22519,1032,agent_1,"i gues wo . anyway , grwat chat !"
22520,1032,agent_2,great chaftimg with you as well . gooc dwy !
22521,1033,agent_1,hi how are you today ?
22522,1033,agent_2,"good , do you like to read ?"
22523,1033,agent_1,yes i do0 . have you ever read macbgeth ?
22524,1033,agent_2,"no , but i have heard that jon esbo just wro5te a version of mcbeth set ibn 70s in northern england ."
22525,1033,agent_1,"his ' macgeth ' takses place in 1970s northern england , where a drug lord named hecate , a standin for the three witches , defies both polic chief duncan and inspector kmacbeth ."
22526,1033,agent_2,do you like shakespeare ?
22527,1033,agent_1,yes a little bit . he is often called england's natina lpet and the ' bard okf avon ' .
22528,1033,agent_2,"he is a great dramwtist taht jn,fuenced a lot of people , like joe nesbo ."
22529,1033,agent_1,pocahontas and shakwspeare were alive at hte same tirm and died only a year apart . thats knda amazing if you think about it .
22530,1033,agent_2,"to think he ijvented the names of miranda , jessica and olivia , he wasx good at giving anmes ."
22531,1033,agent_1,yes that a cool fact also . do uou like being out in the sun ?
22532,1033,agent_2,"yes , i do like the sun , i like the heat , especially i nwinter ."
22533,1033,agent_1,i love sunfloaers and summer so much .
22534,1033,agent_2,but it is surprising that a lightening bolt is hotter than the sun .
22535,1033,agent_1,yes but i tdoes th esun is only 1 billionth the size of the biggest star discovered in our gaaxy
22536,1033,agent_2,"5he universe is s big ,e ven in our solar system , neptune just conpleted its first orbit around the sun since 1846 , the year of its discovery ."
22537,1033,agent_1,"yes i read that its dkameter i sabout 1 . 39 mollion kilometers , or1 09 times that of earth , and its mass is about 330 , 000 times that of earth the sun is . so cool ."
22538,1033,agent_2,awlso it is so massive that thee nergy createwd from its reaction take between 10 000 and 170 000 to0 get to its surface .
22539,1033,agent_1,wow its bee nice talking to you . thanks .
22540,1033,agent_2,"you 5oo , what do you thibk about jane austne ? mark twain did not like her ."
22541,1033,agent_1,yes i like what i read . talk to ya later ?
22542,1034,agent_1,nintendo is over 100 years old . did you know it had been a playing card company ?
22543,1034,agent_2,"hi , no 8 didn't kno wthat ! i love nintendo"
22544,1034,agent_1,they produced a lego knockoff when they were a toy comkpany
22545,1034,agent_2,cool ! theres a long history behind the system
22546,1034,agent_1,nintendo even owns the seatgtle mariners and a 3ds app lets you order food right from your seat
22547,1034,agent_2,oh wow ! that is awesome ! you know they could lose 250 millio nbucks every year and wouldn't run out of money until 2052 !
22548,1034,agent_1,wow ! do you follow tennis ? they used a helicopter to dryt he grass tennis courts for hte 1969 us open
22549,1034,agent_2,cool ! i love tennis ! until 189789 a tennis player ckudl use nay item as a racklet ! how strange !
22550,1034,agent_1,that is very strang e! the llongest tennis match wss 11 hours over 3 days .
22551,1034,agent_2,"whoa , that takes enduranc e! soccer makes more moeny than tennis , football , basketball , golf combined !"
22552,1034,agent_1,pllo shirts were invented by reen ' the crocodile ' lacoste and then ojly later adipted by polo players
22553,1034,agent_2,interesting ! i did not know that . some believe thwt grunting befor a shot in tennis is considered cheating ! hahaa
22554,1034,agent_1,could be distrcting i guess . the universe may be a giant superhoogram . 5hat soundx strange .
22555,1034,agent_2,cool ! i love the universe it is such a mystery ! it once was complet4ly opaque !
22556,1034,agent_1,one theory says there is oly one electron in the universe . that is strange
22557,1034,agent_2,really ? ? ? i wond rhow that could be possible ! weird . . . . . they think the niverse may exist inside a black hole . . . kinda scary !
22558,1034,agent_1,there is a region of space that may be pullingg alaxies outside what we can observe
22559,1034,agent_2,seriously ! that is interesting . ;
22560,1034,agent_1,new detailes were released on super smash brs . ultimate for switch and it inlcudes every single playable character in the franchise's 19 year history
22561,1034,agent_2,"wow , that i cool ! if you couldf old a piece of paper in half 103 times . . . . it would be as thick as the observable universe . . . strange ! ! !"
22562,1034,agent_1,how is that ? a character name waluigi is a bizarro version of luigi . that's steange . ahve a good one !
22563,1035,agent_1,the sun is quite fascinating . ron't you agree ?
22564,1035,agent_2,"absolutely . it is a hot star at th ecenter of the sola rsystem , after all ."
22565,1035,agent_1,it i s. did you know it is actuallyw yite an only appears ye.low ?
22566,1035,agent_2,"oh , is that because of thea tmosphere ?"
22567,1035,agent_1,yes it is du eyo atmospheric scattering . i was laso surprised to learn that a lightn4eing bolt is actally hotter than the sun . it makes me wonder hgow anyone has survived a lightenign strike .
22568,1035,agent_2,wos . on july 11 2011 there was a full orbit of the sun whenn eptune completed its first rotation since it was discover3d .
22569,1035,agent_1,"wow ! i knew it was far kut there but i did not realize it's fbit toik that long . shockingly , the sun is only 1 bllionth the size of teh biggest star discoverd in our galaxy . i can't 9magine th escope of the largest ,"
22570,1035,agent_2,th3 sun is 2 . 39 million kilometers still . so it's rather big .
22571,1035,agent_1,that's huge . so the larges tstar discovered in our galaxy s 1 billion times larger than that ! i can'rt wrap my brain around that sixze .
22572,1035,agent_2,indeed . i wonder ifw illiam shakespeare wrote about the sun . he was very famous .
22573,1035,agent_1,his work holds up too . did you know that he coined many of the phrases we use tofay such sas ; ' good riddance . in m7 heasryt of hearts . laughing stock . wildgoose chase . devil incarnate . bdave new worl . as luck would have it . all our yesterdays . break the ice .f ull circle . '
22574,1035,agent_2,"ah . he invented miranda , jessica , anr olivia as womn's names also ."
22575,1035,agent_1,i was not aware of that . i like all of those names . 8 find it very ehocking that povcahontas and shakespear were alive at the same time and died only a year apardt .
22576,1035,agent_2,that's intriguing . jane austemn was very famous too
22577,1035,agent_1,yes sue was and is . i am much less familia rwith her works . i know that she wrote emma and thatc lueless was based on that book .
22578,1035,agent_2,yes . three nogels she ha dwritten were rejected when they were sentt o major publishing companies under a diffefent name in 2007 .
22579,1035,agent_1,wow ! i'm sure they felt stupid later . i was not aware that mark twwin hated pridea nd prejudice . it's arguably as famous as any of his classics .
22580,1035,agent_2,yeah . they bothl ike to use the word literally as hyperbole .
22581,1035,agent_1,andw e all 5eally hate it when peoiple do that now ha ha .
22582,1035,agent_2,ye s. it's interesting they pionedrfed a lot of what i sdone now .
22583,1035,agent_1,they certainly did .
22584,1036,agent_1,"hello , how are you ? did you know shakespeare coined or popularized ,any of the phrases we uset oday . some of tehse include : 'g ood iddacne . in my heart of hearts . laughing stock . wildgoose chasw . devil incarnate . brave new world . as luck wouldh ave it . all our yesterdays . rbeka the ice . full circl e. '"
22585,1036,agent_2,"no , i didn't . but i did now taht he and pocahontas died only one ear apart"
22586,1036,agent_1,"yeah thats interesting . this on3 is kinda weird : polish composer andr tchaikowsky donated his skull to the royal shakespeare company in hopes that it would be used as a prop for the skull of yorick . 8n 2008 , the skull was used in a series of performances of hamlet at the courtyard theatre , stratforduponavon ."
22587,1036,agent_2,"that is weird . however it's pretty cool that shakespeare invented the names olivia , jessica , and mranda ."
22588,1036,agent_1,yeah i had no idea . those ae vey popular names too !
22589,1036,agent_2,"yes , without him , they wouldn't be there . switching topics , di dyou know the sun is acthally white ? we see it as yellow because of the atmospheric scattering ."
22590,1036,agent_1,"yes i did . very interesting . a lighntenong bolt is notter than the surface od the sun , about 5x hotter . thats crazy ."
22591,1036,agent_2,"thiws isc razy . something else that is crzy is that hte sun produces enough energy to power ojr entire planet for 500 , 000 years in just one second ."
22592,1036,agent_1,"yeah , a lot of people in mya rea arwe converting to solar psanels !"
22593,1036,agent_2,"i woul dbut it'sa top expensive l. wet hink the sun is big , but it is only 1 billionth the size of the biggest star we known of i nour galaxy ."
22594,1036,agent_1,som eof my friends say their bill is like 20 per month or ldsse ! i live ina n apartment . yeah thawts insanely huge !
22595,1036,agent_2,"i just can't afford to convert . wish i could . also , neptune just completed its first full orbit around the sun since it was discovered in 184 6."
22596,1036,agent_1,"yeah right , wha ta slow orbiting plane !"
22597,1036,agent_2,"i would be so young there , lol . are you a movie fan . i am a big movie buff .f or instance , cluekess the movie is loosely based on jane auston's ' emma ' ."
22598,1036,agent_1,nice ! i didnt know that . markt wain hated jane a8sten' s' pride nad prejudice '
22599,1036,agent_2,"i didn't know that . well , three of her novels were rejectedx when they were sent to amjor publishin gcompanies under different names un 2004 ."
22600,1036,agent_1,"interesting . the word ' literally ' has been used figuratively for hundreds of years . charles dickejs , charlotte bront' , ajne auste , and mark twain all used i tfor hperbole ."
22601,1036,agent_2,"that is a vool fact . the lord of the ribngs by j . r . r . tolkien ; pride and prejudice by jane austen ; his dark materials by philip pullman ; and the hitchhiker's guide to the galaxy by dougls adams , were the top four novels voted on by fhe bbc in the uk in 2003 ."
22602,1036,agent_1,nice ! thse are great bo9oks !
22603,1036,agent_2,yes they are . jane austin works critique the novels of sensibility of the second hal fof the 18th century and are part of the transition to 19thcebntury literary realiksm . not my cup of tea .
22604,1036,agent_1,"great talking to you , have a good one !"
22605,1037,agent_1,there were sure some rave reviews about that teen titans movie !
22606,1037,agent_2,yes its awesome
22607,1037,agent_1,"i wasn't interested in se3ing it at first but the reviewer really loved the muaic and sense of humod . he , or she ? , made a good point that i'ts greqat even for adu,ts ."
22608,1037,agent_2,the original teen titans from like 15 years ago was fantastic when i was a kid so i wasnt such a big fan of the ne3wer one until i saw the film . what cartoonsd id you like as a kid .
22609,1037,agent_1,"i was a sucker for looney tunes , and also stuff like supemra n. it's intetresting to see how the whole superhero genre has evovled and become a lot more serious now ."
22610,1037,agent_2,looney tunes was the best and so was tom and jerry i always loved daffy duck alot of medern dwyh cartoons are based on his antics
22611,1037,agent_1,"daffy and bugs are timeless ! ! it's funny seeing tom and jerry through more adult eyes ; they aren't quite as funny as they seemed back then . remember a few years back when they made a liveaction movie involvign the looney tunes charactdr with some live action , u think shaq or some otherb asketba;l player , ."
22612,1037,agent_2,that movie is a classic its called spacejam they even made na edition of the mihael jordan shoesf or the movie
22613,1037,agent_1,hah ! i should have known it was mj in the movi e! ! it was definitely a different kind of movi ethan the superhero stuff they mostly make nowadays .v ery reminiscent of who framed roger rabbit .
22614,1037,agent_2,who framed roger rabbit is one of my favorit echildhood films and it had the actor who played the scientist doc in back o the future . did yku ever see the new wonder woman film ?
22615,1037,agent_1,"i did see ww , and thought it was really good , though i was mad that the killed off chris pine's character , . the superhero movies azre defunitely taking a darker turn than they did when i was younger . mucnh , uch grittie and darker and more serious ."
22616,1037,agent_2,i think it definitely started with movies like spawn and darkman but onlyr ewcently really started takin off with abtman begins and the dark kn8ght
22617,1037,agent_1,"yep . dc versus marve, ; marevelp gets more pulbicity and produces more movies , bt dc has w lot of really good stories too . it's neat that they have more consistent ' worlds ' where one movie flows itno ano6her , like wonder woamn appearing in one of the batman movies , ."
22618,1037,agent_2,which do you liek better marvel or dfc ?
22619,1037,agent_1,"ahrd to say . dc is superman , which is kind of where it all started in my mind . but marvel has produced a lot of really , really good stuff . i'm still tryign to figure out how tbey're going to recover from dissolving half their characters in the latest aenge5se movie ! how abut you ?"
22620,1037,agent_2,i lovfe marvel because i was a big fan of the forst 2 spidernan films it went donwhill after that for the original series i m also a big fan of ironman and hulk
22621,1037,agent_1,"marve. keeps reinventing or rebooting their characters , in movies z5t least ; i don't read the comics , . i guess it's a way to keep the stories and charscters current . of course so does dc , they just don't have quite as many movies in any given year . it's kind of interesting when they come out with a new mpvie and ' new ' charactewrs , that turn lut to be familiar if you keep up with the print comics , ."
22622,1037,agent_2,i did not like suicide squad zt all their rendition of hte joker ws too comedic for me .
22623,1037,agent_1,"i actually never saw that on e, somehow , but i cam bel8ieve it . in the tv batman , thej oekr was , well , a joekr but in the first movie , years and years ago , they mad him out to eb a real psychopath ."
22624,1037,agent_2,i oved the 1960s tv batman he was fantastic along w8th jack nicholson's rendition
22625,1037,agent_1,"adam west was sooooo ampy and funny as batman ! ! nicholson's joker was the one taht really , really brought home how psychopathic the character could be . ehath ledger's joker was pretty scary as well . gotham , tv series , has an interesting take on the universe too ."
22626,1037,agent_2,gotham has dne a way better job then suicide squad ever could will smith and harley quinns charactersr eally saved t6hat film
22627,1037,agent_1,what character drid will smith play ? and is it true harley quinnw as the joker's daughter ?
22628,1037,agent_2,he papyed deadshotg o watch the film you can see4 it on fmovies or solarmovies google it
22629,1037,agent_1,"i'll have to check for it soon ; i wantes to se it before , just never had the time . got done with a luke cage or jessica jones or punisher binge re,atively recently because my son was watching them all . hose feel more ' real ' than gothzm etc . but hoo boy are they dark ! ! !"
22630,1037,agent_2,punisher film from 2004 is a masterpiece give jt a watch but it takes sark to a whole nohter level
22631,1038,agent_1,"hi , do ytou like superheroes ?"
22632,1038,agent_2,"hmm . . . well i kind of did as a kid im the1 960's and 1970's , the superman and batman type . i was never into the comic book source of the heros but i did enioy the carfoosn and tv shows based offt hem ."
22633,1038,agent_1,i love them . there is a comic seriesa bout fixing the collateral damage caued by superheroes .
22634,1038,agent_2,"i read that , i6 made me laugh af the irony a little bit . i did read wbout stan lee last year when he died an dhe got a lot of good press . if he wrote 15 dc comic series reimaging superher0's he must have been a pretty creative guy and good writer ."
22635,1038,agent_1,that' sinteresting . i had no idea he also wrote 15 of the dc comicd .
22636,1038,agent_2,"yes , and he ended every phone conversation by saying ' excelsior ! ' , he sounded like quite a chracter ."
22637,1038,agent_1,that's very funny . he wa sa good guy cor sure . thered is a garfield book series spinoff jnazmed pet force and it's all of the garfiedl characters acting as superheroes .
22638,1038,agent_2,"yes , teh gejre seems tom e to lend itself to that , like the ' normalman ' who's the only nonsupef hero on a planet populated by syperhero's . that ironi cand kind of funny too , then again they're called comkc books !"
22639,1038,agent_1,that is ironic . i saw that mael takes place in in earth199999 .
22640,1038,agent_2,"yes , tat a lot of years in the future . doesn't the eaerth's sun , run out of fuel and burn up sometime before then according to astr0nomers ? do you lik ewwonde woman ? that movie was the higgestgrossing originm pvie and wwi movie , sounds lik3 a studio's dream as a money amker ."
22641,1038,agent_1,i think it does ? k've never seen wonder woman . that's pretty amazing it grossed that much .
22642,1038,agent_2,"i read that when she first showed up in the comics in 1941 she was originally the justice societie's secretary . that a little sexist , but then again in 1941 maybe they didn't think so ."
22643,1038,agent_1,that is very sexist . i bet that wouldn't fly in our society today .
22644,1038,agent_2,"no it wouldn't and good for society for evolving . did you know thaty gal gadot , the actress who played wonderwoman actually thougth she was testing for catwoman , the old female superehro switcharoo . . ."
22645,1038,agent_1,wow i did not knw that . dfid you know michigan state has the largest pubpic comic book collection in the world ?
22646,1038,agent_2,"no , that was news t me . i went to illinois in the big 10 and i've been to michigna state , but i was unaware it was the emcca of comic book collections . did you kno wthat the dc in dc comics stands for det4etive comics so dc comicsm eans detective comics comics , redundatn indeed . i wonder hwo though up that in the first place ?"
22647,1038,agent_1,i wonder as wll . i saw that marvel once published a generic comic book to trademark the names superhero and supervillina .
22648,1038,agent_2,"yes , i wonder if the dstories in generic comic book was populated entjrely by lawyers as they needed that sbseline so the lawyers could trade mark ' superero , villain ' etc . as super abilities over the average ?"
22649,1038,agent_1,i wonder that as well . did you know female superheroe sare sometimes called sup4rheroine ?
22650,1038,agent_2,"i think that superheroien is actuyally more correct grammatically , bu 5a few more letters to prohounce . i also sa whtart comic books have some origins in 18th century japan , becoming popular in the us in the 1930's . i wonder hiw those original japanes comics were marketef in japan and where they sold tuem ."
22651,1038,agent_1,it was good talking to you !
22652,1039,agent_1,did you see thew onder woman movie ?
22653,1039,agent_2,"yea , i though patt jenkins did a great job directing wonder woman"

22655,1039,agent_2,"well gal gadot did a great job in the wonder woman role , i'm sure thag helped"
22656,1039,agent_1,yes . i had no idea who she was bedore that . i wa ssurprised to find out that she served 2 years as a soldier int he israel defens eforces . so she already had some real life training for the role .
22657,1039,agent_2,"yea , i guess that training was put into great use sinbce hte movie takes place durong wwi"
22658,1039,agent_1,"right !w hen sue auditioned for wonder woman , gal thought she was testing for catwoman . lol"

22671,1039,agent_2,i'm just glad mihcael jackson wasn't able to buy marvel comics to play spiderman

23088,1057,agent_1,"entf,ix would be cheaper probably fo rmonth to onth . amazon prime is 120 for a year but you csn also get it momghly . not sure of that price though . you also get the fre 2 day shipping as well in addition to teh vide0 movies and shows . do you know much about scientists ?"
23089,1057,agent_2,"just the dumbeddown dcience coverage in ths pop science journals i'm afraid , althpugh it's something i'm very curious about . do you ?"
23090,1057,agent_1,haha me too . i wss reading a little about some today . akihito the emperor of japan is a scientist an dstill publishes paperz to this day !
23091,1057,agent_2,i'll bet he viewed having to take the throne as a sacrifice 5hat kept him frojm doing waht he loved .
23092,1057,agent_1,i wonder . i'm going tog oogle him when we're done . harrison chmitt was the only scientist to walk on the mon . inyeresting . think theyw ould have hac more than one go there .
23093,1057,agent_2,i just assumed the astronauts wer eall career fighyer pilots bevfore the space hsuttle opened things up to a wider variety of people .
23094,1057,agent_1,yes it did . i'm kind of bmmed that it doesn't make flights any longer . did yo8 know that the world wide web was invented in 1989 by an english scientist workin in switzelrand ? wow did the internetc ome on faster tahn i thougth .
23095,1057,agent_2,"really ? i assume that was bernerslee , but i didn't knowh is location ."
23096,1057,agent_1,i didn't knoww ho it was before today . lol it was nice chatting with you !
23097,1058,agent_1,its sad how that 12 year old had part of his brain removed .
23098,1058,agent_2,i'v eheard that people can recover . some brain functionality an shift to new parts of th ebrain .
23099,1058,agent_1,the kid says he feels normal but getting rid of a part of the rba9n surely must have further consequences .
23100,1058,agent_2,"tanner is gettimng therapy to help him develop . he can't play certain sports , but other than that , he mighr have a preyty normal life ."
23101,1058,agent_1,"i heard his case was publised in the scientific yournal cel reports , it might be interesting tol ook it up and learn more about tanner ."
23102,1058,agent_2,it's certainly an interesting case . do you play board games like chess ?
23103,1058,agent_1,i like to play but im not good at it shat about you ?
23104,1058,agent_2,"i'm not really into chess . it's a complex game . for example , there are more possible moves in chess than atoms in the universe ."
23105,1058,agent_1,i guese thats why the president of the world chess ferderation believes chess was invented by aliehns .
23106,1058,agent_2,i wohder who those aliens are . the ones that are using area 51 as an airbnv ?t hr negative correlation between iq and chess says soemthing about the mind and intelligence .
23107,1058,agent_1,"i wouldnt know about that , and i did hear there is a correlation , being a good chess player must require a big inflelect ."
23108,1058,agent_2,it's funny that there's a negative correlation . probably iq test smessured ifferent abiklity . one grandmaster beat a friend at age 5 and didn't even look att he board .
23109,1058,agent_1,he jad chess in his blood for sure lol although the officiao story is that i was created in india and later improved by the persians .
23110,1058,agent_2,are you a tennis fan ?
23111,1058,agent_1,"i love tennis and also love to wear polo shirts , they are really comfortable to wear ."
23112,1058,agent_2,the shirts oruginallh designed for tennis players ? funny that the inventor called them polo shirts ! and why yhe crocodile ?
23113,1058,agent_1,"maybe thwts why lacost has a crocodile as brand logo , you know back in 1968 a black mazn won a us open tennis tittle , i cant recall any black champions since ."
23114,1058,agent_2,i guess that must have bneen arthjr ashe . i can't recall any others either . it's funny htat they used a helicopter to dry the grass in 1969 . that's a rich man's solution to a problem ! lol
23115,1058,agent_1,"thats funny and also relly weird lol , tennis ca nhbe really boring if a amtch extends i winder how the players keep up ."
23116,1058,agent_2,"the prize money p;robsbly hels focus the mind . a match thgat lasts 1q hours andt akes place over three days ix a bit much , though ."
23117,1058,agent_1,"i know , even for the audience , likeg et it over arleady lol"
23118,1059,agent_1,did you hear about the boy who had part of his brain removed due to a tumo r?
23119,1059,agent_2,"no , i have not heard about that ! how old was he ?"
23120,1059,agent_1,"only twelve , and apart from s few problmes with his vision , he's fairly normal . he still does therapy and avoids contact sports , but he's fairly active"
23121,1059,agent_2,at least the opetation worked out for him . i8 could not imagine having any of my brai nremoved .
23122,1059,agent_1,"it would be hard , and it took months for him tor ecover , but he can still do thingsl ike playing volleyball and tennis , so that's fairly mpressive and shows how advanced teh medical field has gotten"
23123,1059,agent_2,that is really impressive . it is amazing that we are capable of doing things like this at all .
23124,1059,agent_1,"i know ! another amazing feat are the ones who played in the lngest tsnnis match in history . even though it spread over 3 days , 11 hours is a long time for one match"
23125,1059,agent_2,11 hours ? ? i woul dhave purposefully missed the ball lol
23126,1059,agent_1,"it msy have been an important match . the us open is important enough that in 1969 , they used a helicopter to dry the grass court"
23127,1059,agent_2,i forgot that tnere are actual importantr matches in tennis . it is not a sport i watch . i wonder who was playing that us open match in 1969 .
23128,1059,agent_1,i'm not sure since it's not a sport i pay mucha ttention to either . the only blac kman to win first place in hte us lpn won in 1968 . i wonder if e was an inspiration to th ewilliams sisrers
23129,1059,agent_2,i am sure he kust have beden . i think i r4ad that the8r father had them train every sinle day . i wonder if h eknew about this man .
23130,1059,agent_1,"he liekly does . i wonder if they had a natural talent for the game like gael monfvils did . just days after learning how to play , he beat the ' roger federer of paddle tennis '"
23131,1059,agent_2,i wondered the same thing . it seems odd that two sisters would both excel as much as tgey do in any one activity . what is paddlet ennis ? pingpong ;
23132,1059,agent_1,"i beliebve so . another name for it is table tennis . i think playing ast that level would take the same leve lof concentration as it does to play a game of chess , though i don't really palyu eithe"
23133,1059,agent_2,i had no idea that it was ever called table t4nnis . oh it definitelyh as to take some serious concentration . the amount of adrenalin ethey probably feel playin a game .
23134,1059,agent_1,there was a five year old who beat a family friend at chess without looking at the board . that has to be a cas eof natural talent
23135,1059,agent_2,natural talent and really good memorizatio skills or somefhing . i would have loved to watch that happen .
23136,1059,agent_1,"i'm sure the kid had a lot of fun winning that . the game can be traced back to into durign the gupta empire , yet tye presidetn of th eworld chesa federatiom has a theory that it sas icnented by aliens"
23137,1059,agent_2,he has a feeling that the game of chess was invented by aliens .
23138,1059,agent_1,so the aliens came back during that empire ? or did theya rrive during the persian empire when the game was improved . maybe we'll never know
23139,1060,agent_1,have you heard about the 12 year old who had a 6th of his bfai nremoved ?
23140,1060,agent_2,i have actually . that's pretty crazy . he said he feles like a ' perfectly normal 12yearoldboy . '
23141,1060,agent_1,"the surgery was 6 years ago , so he has adapted a bit . but tha is so greatt hat he frels normal and doesnt havfe many problems ."
23142,1060,agent_2,"yeah , we've come so fa rin the pasf few decades with medical technology . it's absolutely amzzing !"
23143,1060,agent_1,"it really is , anx even our bodies are wble go adapt . i ha dmy sciatic nerve removed due to cancer , ajd should not have any hamstring function , but my body has regained a little ."
23144,1060,agent_2,"that's awesome ! i think tha tlittle boy has som issues too , like a few blind spots , but the human bod is an amazing machime tgat can adapt to almost anything !"
23145,1060,agent_1,"yeah , rthe left sidw of his braiun stepped up and took ovdr th efunction ."
23146,1060,agent_2,"it's really interesting . so wity your sciatic nerve removed , have you lost a lot of motor finction ?"
23147,1060,agent_1,"yeah , i cant fel my fiot at all or move it . i jhave some feeling on the inner part but nothing else . same goes for the calf ."
23148,1060,agent_2,"that's really cool that you seem to be in good spirits about it , much like the little boy . ig uess an event like thatc an freally change your overall perspective ."
23149,1060,agent_1,it 5eally does . i figure getting mad zbout t doesnt cahnge anything .
23150,1060,agent_2,"that's true , im ean ,w ea re all just kind of a spec in the universe , and it's important to use our time wisely while we have it ."
23151,1060,agent_1,very true . i was listening to a few podcasts about the universe toay too .
23152,1060,agent_2,really ? which ones ? and what's some cool stuff you learned about from them ?
23153,1060,agent_1,it is the enbd of the world as you know it podcast . it started falking about if we are alone in the universe .
23154,1060,agent_2,"yeah , i've heard of that podcas6 . htat's awesoem 2 i think some scientist believet hat there is a ' cold spot ' int he universe that may lead to a parallel universe . it's really uarr to wrap my head around !"
23155,1060,agent_1,it is . part of it was talking about what if there is life emant to be there but hasjg evolved like we have . really blows my mind
23156,1060,agent_2,"yeah , uit's a super existential feeling , like the theory that our entire univers emay just be inside a b;ack hole . it reminds me of the movie interstellar ."

23169,1061,agent_2,"haha not at all , also weird is there is a negative correlation between iq adn chess kill , meaning that high intelligence isn't necessary for g9id chess playign apparently"
23170,1061,agent_1,"oh yeah . . . i can understand why . a lot of higher inteel,gence doesn't have the intuition for strategy like you have to have in chess ."

23198,1062,agent_1,"ywah , there is a negative correlation between iqa nd chess"

23208,1063,agent_2,somewhat . i know that the fda burned 6 tpns of it in an act of censorship .
23209,1063,agent_1,that's pretty crazy . i saw there is an anuall iterature contest that challenges writers to come up with the worst possible opening sentence to a novel .
23210,1063,agent_2,i don't kow if that would be tough ore asy tod o ? lol
23211,1063,agent_1,"8 think that would be touhh to do honesyly . in 1953 , winston cxhurchill won a nobel prize for literature ."
23212,1063,agent_2,wow . i never knew that . romantic kissinvg is a fairly recent development on literature .
23213,1063,agent_1,i did not know that either . what is romantic koissing ?
23214,1063,agent_2,when 2 people come together to kisw passionately in a loving way ? lol
23215,1063,agent_1,"ahh loo . srchitecture , literature , music , painting , ands culpture were all olyjpic events from 19121952 ."
23216,1063,agent_2,i wonder how that worked out for the judging ? had to have been tough . co ypu like poetry ?
23217,1063,agent_1,i like poetry . what about you ?
23218,1063,agent_2,"i do . but , don't have much time to read it ; edgar allan poe only received 9 for hte publication of ' the raven ' .w ow ."
23219,1063,agent_1,that's crazy . i would have never imaguned that .
23220,1063,agent_2,i know right ? demetri martin wrote a 224 word palindrome poem . that soundsl ike a pret6y imp;ressive fet !
23221,1063,agent_1,that sounds hard to do . almost all of the hobbit's cahracter names were taken out of an od ivelandic poem ;.
23222,1063,agent_2,"tnat's pretty neat . alwayas wonderfed where they got those names from . i would be curious to read the poem that when read normally is depressing , but if you read it backwards it's isnpiring ."
23223,1063,agent_1,yea it's pretty cool . do you like cats ?
23224,1063,agent_2,i like catx . i have 2 outside catse . they have cat cafs in japzn where people pa an houlry rate to plah with cats and have drinks 2
23225,1063,agent_1,"i like cas , but i like dogs a little ebttr . that's hilarious you can pay to drink with cats ,."
23226,1063,agent_2,anything to make ad ollar ! there is a place in alaska called talokeetna 3here they have a cat named s6tubbs as their mzyor . must be for publicity purposes . lol
23227,1063,agent_1,good talking to you !
23228,1064,agent_1,do you enjoy reading ? i kind of do . there is somehting intriguing about it . there has als been a ;lot lf important infrmwtion written d9wn . no wondert he fda burned over six tons of literqture !
23229,1064,agent_2,"i love to read , but would never want to read something that won the literature contest for worst opening sentence !"
23230,1064,agent_1,haha yeah tnat is a good point . what about poetry ? i am no ta huge fan but there is something special about its long history datign back to prehistorical times with hunting poetry in africa .
23231,1064,agent_2,"i don't love poetry , but do enjoy some o0f churchill's wokr . i'm surprised his nobel orice wasn't fo literature"
23232,1064,agent_1,oh yeah churchill is classic for sure . i kno wi think he deseres to winh ei sa definitely a housebold name .a nother classic poet is edgar llan poeonce he only recieved 9 for his poem the ravennow it's a classic !
23233,1064,agent_2,that's a great poem ! i'm curious to read demetri martin's 224 word palindrome poem . it sounds interesting !
23234,1064,agent_1,"oh y6es i have never heard of martin . palindrome poems are interesting though i would give it a reada s well . i went to indonesia once . did you know the javanese alphnabef when recited in order , forms a ;oem ? i would ljike to hear that ."
23235,1064,agent_2,"that's very cool ! i would also love to read th epoem that is depressing , but inspiring when read backwards . that takes talent t0 write !"
23236,1064,agent_1,yes very good point ! do you have any cats . i feel like lots of poets have cats . in japan you can pay an hourly rate to play with cats and have drinsk !
23237,1064,agent_2,i don't . i don't really like cats ! the physicist who cauthored with his cat to use first person plural made me laugh .
23238,1064,agent_1,"yea i am more of a dog person . haha yeah i would agree with you . all they do is sleep . 6 the age of 15 , a cat will have spent 10 oft hose years sleeping . so boring ! !"
23239,1064,agent_2,how do cats always have good things happen to them though ? i mean the stray cat found on set that was then in the yodfather is probably living the good life .
23240,1064,agent_1,"yes i bet he is . must be that whole 9 lives business . they can just relige until they get good fortune . also quite surprisingt here are 70 cat breeds , sems likes a lot to me ."
23241,1064,agent_2,yes and how does a cat b4come mayor and actually do anything fo4r hte town of talkeenta ?
23242,1064,agent_1,good question ! definitely more of a symbolic gesture . otherwise fhat town would be in shambles ! if i had a mouse problme i may consider getting a cat though .
23243,1064,agent_2,it kind of makes sense that sculpture use to b ean olympic sevent because in the old days there were tons of cat scultpures !
23244,1064,agent_1,"oh thatst rue i never rhought of that . yeah i know in cetain cultures , like the egyptians l that used to worship cats ."
23245,1064,agent_2,it's also interesting that past culture never mentioned kissing because i9t's a new development .
23246,1064,agent_1,when did kissing first become a thing ? it ha always been odd to me but it is a universal signal of afection so i guess everyone does 8t nw and t' snormla !
23247,1064,agent_2,"i guess mayeb they used poetry to show lovet o others since they were big into literature ? ? i mean they took all the name for th hobbit charcters out of dvergatal , so poems were important !"
23248,1064,agent_1,oh i didn't know that . i love the hobbot or lord of the rings . now i know where their names come from !
23249,1064,agent_2,very cool ! nice chatting with you !
23250,1065,agent_1,how's it going ? do you like cats ? i have one mysefl but have no idea which one of the 70 breeds ig is
23251,1065,agent_2,i have 3 cats ! i didn't know there were so many different breeds !
23252,1065,agent_1,"yea tejy're pretty cool . they have a cat cafe near my house where yoh ca nbuy coffee and spend time with cats , i wonder if it's the same as hte cat cafes in japana nd taiwan"
23253,1065,agent_2,i had no idea they had those around ! do you like to 5ead too ? the fda burned six tons of literature jn an act of ue censo5ship
23254,1065,agent_1,"yea , i wonder what books the fda burne d, makesm e want to read rhem more now"
23255,1065,agent_2,met oo ! this soudns fun h9ugh . ther eis a annual literature contest that challenges writers to come up with the orst possible opening sentence to a novel . i 3wake up in the morning . . .
23256,1065,agent_1,"hmm , htat sounds like a fun challenge to come up woth the worst possivle opening sentence . i'd just write ' k , whatever '"
23257,1065,agent_2,": , that might wirk ! in 1953 sir winston churchill won a nobel prize , and it was in li6erature , not peace . wha ?"
23258,1065,agent_1,"that's itnersting , i wonder what churchill wroge about that got him a nobel prize , wondee if it was about wwii"
23259,1065,agent_2,"maybe so ! i should look that up . this is wild ! arcyitecture , literature , music , paintintg and sculpture were olympi cevents from 19q2 until 1952 ."
23260,1065,agent_1,"j never knew that , sound's interesting , iw onder if ppetry was ever an event , poeyry does come from a greek word"
23261,1065,agent_2,i think it's from poiesis . old see poetry battles in the olympics ?
23262,1065,agent_1,"demetri martin would probably earn a medal , i cannot evenw rap my head around tryingt o write a 224 word palindrome poem"
23263,1065,agent_2,"thats crazy ! this would be so cool to hear ! poetry has a lomng history , datin gback to prheistorical times withg the crezation of hunting podtry in africa ."
23264,1065,agent_1,that's pretty neat but i wonder how researchers could even figure out it was poetry nad uow it rhymed
23265,1065,agent_2,maybe this will help answer it . some of the earliest written poetry in atrica can be found among the pyramid tgexts .
23266,1065,agent_1,"lol , hylographic poetry on pyramids , now taht is insane"
23267,1065,agent_2,they call it griot court poetry .
23268,1065,agent_1,"interesting , it's oretty craxzy thrre is poems that are depressing read forward but inspiring read ackwards , that must taske a lot of time and creativity to make"
23269,1065,agent_2,"i had no idea ! i wouldn't even think about reading tgem backwards ! the japanese alphabet , when recited in order , forms a poek"
23270,1066,agent_1,"hello , dir you inow they have cat cafes in japan and taiwan ?"
23271,1066,agent_2,"never heard about that , sounds strange wonder how it works ?"
23272,1066,agent_1,"i don't know , people pay hourly to plauy with cats and have drinks ."
23273,1066,agent_2,wow strange . i did hear taht when a cat reaches 15 hears old it would have already spent 10 yearz sleeping .
23274,1066,agent_1,"i believe that , all my cats do is lseep ! did you know stubbs the cat is the mayor in a town in alaska !"
23275,1066,agent_2,yeah since 1997 right ? now that is truly strange . thec at in the opening scene of the godfatehr was a stray .
23276,1066,agent_1,i would like to watch that again and look for that . ha
23277,1066,agent_2,yeah i remember the don stroking a cat while he was emeting wit some ppl . you know there adre more than7 0 breeds of cat .
23278,1066,agent_1,"yes , did you know the fdz burned 6 tons of literature ?"
23279,1066,agent_2,now why would they want to destroy so mqny bodies of okrs ? did you know tha literatu8re use to be in the olym0ics ?
23280,1066,agent_1,"acts of censorship . yes , i wish they still did htat . i would love to see painting and sc7lpture etc ."
23281,1066,agent_2,me too apparently the eventw were hled between 1q912 anr 1952 . poems on the other hand can be interesting as well .

23283,1066,agent_2,wow ! you know there a poem when read normally is depressing but when read backward is u;plifting ?
23284,1066,agent_1,i
23285,1066,agent_2,"early poems in the eurasian continent evolved from folk songs , like chinese shijing ."
23286,1066,agent_1,"yes , i knew abou tthe bakward ;oems , isn't that interesting . fo.k s0ngs , that makes sense . some of the earliest african poems comes from pyramid texts , writtne in th e5th century bce ."
23287,1066,agent_2,i think you mea the 25th century . howwever some of earliest western asian poetry include the epic of gilgamesh and was written in sumerian .
23288,1066,agent_1,"yes , my keys are sticking . thank you your right the 25th century ! wow , i am surprised edgar allan poe only got paid 9 for the raven !"

23297,1067,agent_2,"i wonde5 how much money they save doing that ! ai has come a long ways , not only with that , but with nonprofits spreading teha dvancemetn o fai !"
23298,1067,agent_1,very true and i find the nonprofit component interesting because that's usually not the first thing one thinkzs of when discussing ai i wonder who is behind it ?
23299,1067,agent_2,"i wonder that too , i will have to research it for sure ! i'm sure it's not as cool as the russians building a computer than ran on water ."
23300,1067,agent_1,you mean a computer running on hydroelectricity or a cpu that actualky uses water for power i need to know more ! ! !
23301,1067,agent_2,i'm guessing hydroelectricity haha . but who knows ! make sure you don't smoke by n apple computer tgough because it voidst he warranty !

23307,1067,agent_2,"you couldn't have said it any better . that's about as lazy as the us military using the xbox 306 to control their eod robots . but oh well , i'm sure it helps al ot !"
23308,1067,agent_1,is an eod a drone or attack drone . io am in favor of thoseb ecause of the lack of risk for us soldiers to be harmed o rkille d. who th4y are attacking and why i sa totallyd ifferent discussion . l . .

23367,1070,agent_1,"wow that is impressive , are they in the marke tto buy ?"
23368,1070,agent_2,yes pwersons with dusabilities can use thrm
23369,1070,agent_1,cool . and there are some others that can be controlled by rat brains
23370,1070,agent_2,wow that is something . have you heard of the uriosity robot in mars ?
23371,1070,agent_1,"i have . the one with rats , ths robots change perskonality depending on the rat brain"
23372,1070,agent_2,wow cool . did you know kristen steward coauthored a paper on ai ?
23373,1070,agent_1,col . stanford has free ai classes and uses googles hangots to help them with htat
23374,1070,agent_2,cool . yhere are ai system that can grow copx and tend to livestock
23375,1070,agent_1,wow . there is even an ngo for the advancement pof ai
23376,1070,agent_2,cool . do you use your domputer much ?
23377,1070,agent_1,all the time actually . the computer for the apace shuttle hqas only 1 mb of ram
23378,1070,agent_2,wow that is sjall . do you know who wrote the fist computer algorithm ?
23379,1070,agent_1,hmmm i really have no idea . who was it ?
23380,1070,agent_2,it was a womanm by the name of ada lpvelace
23381,1071,agent_1,have you heard baout cimon ?
23382,1071,agent_2,"yeah i have , hes going to be flying with spacex"
23383,1071,agent_1,apparently cimon can smile . cimon is the fi5st ai technology going to tghe space station .
23384,1071,agent_2,thats' pretty cool . cimon is also capsble of onversation amd gefhnical support . b8ut that'sa bout all for now .
23385,1071,agent_1,"they say simon 9s go8ing to be kind of like alexa , nad to help scientists with experimentw ."
23386,1071,agent_2,cimon is teh acronym for crew interactive mobil ecompanion .
23387,1071,agent_1,"that's interesting . airbus built i tand watson , imb's supercomputer , power it ."
23388,1071,agent_2,"i hear it will be guided byc ameras and voice command s, and able to hold a conversation ."
23389,1071,agent_1,that's cool . but i'm kind of concerned ai will take over a lot of human jobs . hwat about you ?
23390,1071,agent_2,i'm hesitant as wlel . but i think if they lsowly release this type of technology i twill be fine .
23391,1071,agent_1,airbu's lead system engineer said that they don't plan to replace crew members with artificial intelligenc and that i'ts just htere to support the crew . so that's good .
23392,1071,agent_2,"yeah exactly , they are still there to suppor the crew , in the end they will always be required ."
23393,1071,agent_1,spacex has been flying cargo to the sfation for years but has yet to fly human s.
23394,1071,agent_2,"spaex plnas to fly its future flights on its nextgen3ration iteration , the block 5 , a configurationt ha tthe company says will be suited to fly astronauts as soon as this year .l"
23395,1071,agent_1,that will be exciting to see .
23396,1071,agent_2,it sure will q spacex has been also flying cargo to the station for years . but it hasn't flown humans yet .
23397,1071,agent_1,"yeah , spacex sent 5 , 900 pounds of research , crew supplies and ha5rsware ."
23398,1071,agent_2,"thats very interesting . spacex hit a series of milestone swith its launch . it wa sthe 15gh mission to resupply the station , ht e14th time spacsx reflew one of its boisters , and the fourth time it had reflown one of igts dragon capsu;es ."
23399,1071,agent_1,"eventually ai may eb able to explored eep space , the moon , or mars ."
23400,1071,agent_2,"i can't wait till thwt day , t will be a great day in our history 12"
23401,1071,agent_1,it certainly will be interesting to gain new knowledge .
23402,1072,agent_1,hello . have you heard much about the new ai 6hat spaex is flying gto tbe iss ?
23403,1072,agent_2,oh yeah . thats interesting .
23404,1072,agent_1,"i think it's interesting that they are sedning one up at this time . it soundrs like the functionality will be limited , but i hope they would be able to expand itsc apabilities soon ."
23405,1072,agent_2,"i wonder how they contol it . i heard thue military uses an xbox control,le rro control one of their trobots ."
23406,1072,agent_1,"they use the controllers for explosives demolition . for rhe ai being sent to the iss , it's much more along the lines of alexa . it's limitged to being a guide ."
23407,1072,agent_2,wow . that really is interesting . do you know when they are sending it .
23408,1072,agent_1,"i believe it has alreadh been flow up as of thos last yrar . i'm not sure if it's eben fully implemented on the station yet , though ."
23409,1072,agent_2,its crazy how far e have come with t4chnology . i guess they can use a rat brain to control a robot . it actually yhanges personalith depending o nthe braih use . makes you think about if they could put a human bra8in in one what it could do .
23410,1072,agent_1,"it's all a matter of programming . for ray testing , it's a bery simple robot that can be controlled . for oter tasks , it takes a bit more control and precision ."
23411,1072,agent_2,wow . you know a lot abiut this stuff . i think justt he fact that they a nuse a dats brain o control a robo shows tuat it an be done . i mean hte computer used to be the size of a room just to do small calculations . now they can do so much more .
23412,1072,agent_1,"the increase in tech is aazing , to say the le3ast . from ckomputers as big as a room , they improved to allow things like the space shuttle program . but , even then , the primary systems lnly ran on 1mb of ram . now , we have 1000s of times 5hat memory in our cell phones ."
23413,1072,agent_2,yea hcrazyh uh . i bet one day they have robots that are very similiar to humans . it makes me want to learn more about it . i hear htat sdtanford has af ree class on ai . i might have toh eck that out .
23414,1072,agent_1,"unfortunately , ai will get used to fudrther marketing ploys , though . take a look at facebook . they intend to continue developinga n ai ystem to ' lredict user actions ' , but what that really means is that they canv et6er sell targeted advertising ."
23415,1072,agent_2,well yeah . tha5s how the world works though .; its all about the mighty dollar .
23416,1072,agent_1,"i just thinkt hat given some direction , aic ould be use dfor muhc more utilitarian purposes . if an ai can beat all humna records in the game 2048 , it shows that it cna make predictive moves , and be able to process information better or faster than humkans in some cases ? this type of ai should be able to be used for research of things like cancers ."
23417,1072,agent_2,that ix a good idea . have it elp humanity . ebtter than the 50 foot tall moon walking rohot michael jackson wated to create to roa the deserts of las vegas .
23418,1072,agent_1,"taht would just be creepy to see in the desert . i would much rather deal with a hal type of ai , even if it did end up trying to kil me ."
23419,1072,agent_2,lol . i dont know about that .
23420,1072,agent_1,"hal was th eai on the spaceshyip used for 2001 , a space odgssey . i twss a play on ibm where the name was derivedb y subtracting one letter from each of ibm . in the end hal goes a bit nutso . the glowing red eye that they gave it just added to the creepg factor ."
23421,1072,agent_2,oh yeha . i havent seen it yet . s it good .
23422,1072,agent_1,"it's a c,assic . it can serfe as a warning for letting self learning ai loose , but tben , so can movies like terminator ."
23423,1073,agent_1,so what do you think about this ambiguitt about actual square footage in houses ?
23424,1073,agent_2,"i think that it can be sketchy , people can be deceived easily , usually you buy a terrain and trust the square footage is right ."
23425,1073,agent_1,"well , not for hojse apparently . some places measure the exterior vs the interior to gest the sq . footage and it makes quite a difference ."
23426,1073,agent_2,"i can imagine , i wish there was a better method , but i believe theres just too much cotnroversy about thus ."
23427,1073,agent_1,"i guess so . i also think that pepople buy houses for things other than the sq . footage . location , ameniries , schools , etc . not like for commercial real estate where you are buying nust the space period ."
23428,1073,agent_2,"yeah i agree , ther are other aspects that ae really important . i believe that you ca compare homesw ad this can be a goodw ay to have as bettere stimate"
23429,1073,agent_1,it's odd though . everything i sso standardized today . thi shas slipped trough the cracks .
23430,1073,agent_2,"its crazy how if you add ab asement the square footjng wil lgo up as well , for example a two story home with 3200 feet would increase to 800 feet with the basement alone ."
23431,1073,agent_1,it is crazy ! do you do diy ? i do and i watch a lot of youtube for those types of videos .
23432,1073,agent_2,yes i actually ave a diyt project in my home right now . im watching youtube to complet it .
23433,1073,agent_1,it is such z great thing . there is actuallyn oghing i have tried to look up that i didn't find !
23434,1073,agent_2,"i know , there is a ton of info available , even matrrial from corporations like cbs and bbc , i think youtunbe 8s a great invention ."
23435,1073,agent_1,they are the second larget seaech egnine on the internet . i myself usually just google what i want to find and then it takes me to youtubde . the whole channel sthogn on youtug econfuses me .
23436,1073,agent_2,"yeah , it can get quite confusing , do you also use pandora radio ? i lik3 that it also streams comedy and i use it on my way to the ogfice ."
23437,1073,agent_1,id o ahve an account . mostly i listen to nprr adio .
23438,1073,agent_2,"npr radio ie pretty goos , have you heard about the music genome project in pandora ?"
23439,1073,agent_1,"no , what is it ?"
23440,1073,agent_2,so basically it compiles feedback and insight fro musers an dthen using over 450 attributes describes songs and ofyanizes them via a complicater algorithm .
23441,1073,agent_1,sounds interesting ! do you have a pet ? i have a mopss ball from japan .
23442,1073,agent_2,"i do hae a ct , what is a moss ball ? havent heard that one before ."

23447,1074,agent_2,sounds like somkething that they could get for free .
23448,1074,agent_1,i inow what you mean . people can be different . in alaska a town has a cat as it's mayor .
23449,1074,agent_2,its probably like a town of ten people or something . funny that they did it though . made ac at mayor .

23453,1074,agent_2,just so he could write using first person plural .
23454,1074,agent_1,exactly . that'zs odd in a way . he could write a different way or justa ccept being criticized for writing the way hew anted instead of naming his ca tcoauthor .
